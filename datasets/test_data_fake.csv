"Breaking: Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of Misconduct\nAllegations of misconduct against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore have come in recently. The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago.\n\nMore reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl.\n\nA Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewis’s profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called “Beth” had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime.\n\nLewis’s tweet read, “A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.”\n\nA family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????\n\nIn later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorney’s office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up.\n\nJustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewis’s tweet. She stated that she “wouldn’t be surprised” if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses “make things harder” for real victims.\n\nLewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would “find out” the truth. He also stated that “Jean,” who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call.\n\nBradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.\n\nLewis wrote back to Powless explaining that he had already done so, but “Jean” didn’t trust the agencies so she chose to talk to her local law enforcement.\n\n“Can’t blame her with FBI in stories every day,” Lewis added.\n\nIt is important that while these allegations haven’t been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth.\n\nMoore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false.\n\nMoore spoke to Newsweek and stated, “These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now.”\n\nThe Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone.\n\nLet’s hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision.","http://eveningw.com/breaking-woman-says-offered-big-money-washington-post-accuse-roy-moore-misconduct/","1510584829.0"
"Could Nutella give you CANCER? Chocolate spread maker embroiled in controversy over claims key ingredient is carcinogenic\nNutella's manufacturers have hit out at a landmark report that found one of its ingredients to be cancerous.\n\nThe chocolate spread relies on palm oil for its smooth texture and considerably long shelf life.\n\nHowever, a report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) declared it to be more carcinogenic than any other oil, following similar claims by the WHO.\n\nNow, since Nutella's profits have taken a 3 percent hit, the manufacturer Ferrero has launched a televised campaign, insisting they use palm oil in a way that is not dangerous.\n\nThe commercial insists the spread would not be the same without refined palm oil.\n\nIt does not mention the other compelling factor: since palm oil is the cheapest oil on the market, a switch in ingredients would cost Ferrero an extra $8-22 million a year.\n\nNutella relies on palm oil for its smooth texture and considerably long shelf life. But it is now at the center of a controversy over claims refined palm oil could be carcinogenic\n\nWHY COULD REFINED PALM OIL BY CANCEROUS? The detailed EFSA report, published in May 2016, said palm oil is more dangerous than other vegetable oils when refined at temperatures above 200 degrees Celsius. High temperatures are used to remove palm oil's natural red color and neutralize its smell. This process, however, causes contaminants called glycidyl fatty acid esters (or, GE) to form. When digested, GE has a tendency to break down and release glycidol, a compound strongly believed to cause tumors. According to a report by the US National Institutes of Health, oral exposure to glycidol has caused tumors at many different tissue sites in lab mice and lab rats. However, Ferrero says it uses an industrial process that combines a temperature of just below 200C and extremely low pressure to minimize contaminants.\n\n'Making Nutella without palm oil would produce an inferior substitute for the real product, it would be a step backward,' Ferrero's purchasing manager Vincenzo Tapella said.\n\nHe features in a TV commercial aired in Italy over the past three months that has drawn criticism from politicians as they call for palm oil to be banned.\n\nThe detailed EFSA report, published in May 2016, said palm oil is more dangerous than other vegetable oils when refined at temperatures above 200 degrees Celsius.\n\nHigh temperatures are used to remove palm oil's natural red color and neutralize its smell.\n\nThis process, however, causes contaminants called glycidyl fatty acid esters (or, GE) to form.\n\nWhen digested, GE has a tendency to break down and release glycidol, a compound strongly believed to cause tumors.\n\nAccording to a report by the US National Institutes of Health, oral exposure to glycidol has caused tumors at many different tissue sites in lab mice and lab rats.\n\nHowever, Ferrero says it uses an industrial process that combines a temperature of just below 200C and extremely low pressure to minimize contaminants.\n\nThe process takes longer and costs 20 percent more than high-temperature refining, Ferrero told Reuters.\n\nBut it said this had allowed it to bring GE levels so low that scientific instruments find it hard to trace the chemical.\n\n'The palm oil used by Ferrero is safe because it comes from freshly squeezed fruits and is processed at controlled temperatures,' Tapella says in the TV ad, which was filmed at the firm's factory in the northern town of Alba and was accompanied by full-page ads in newspapers carrying the same message.\n\nIt is this 'refining' process that Nutella's makers boast about so fiercely on their website's 'ingredients' section.\n\n'Palm oil is used in Nutella to give the product its creamy texture, as well as to heighten the flavor of its ingredients, thanks to its properties that enable it to have a neutral odor and taste after the refining process,' the website reads.\n\n'Furthermore, it is the best ingredient for giving Nutella the right smoothness, guaranteeing its special spreadability,' it continues.\n\nThe description even goes as far as to claim palm oil protects consumers from demonic 'trans fats': 'Above all, avoiding the hydrogenation process that would produce otherwise unhealthy trans fats.'\n\nIt concludes: 'Palm fruit oil also helps to maintain the unique taste of Nutella along its whole shelf life, due to its higher stability to oxidation compared to other vegetable oils.'\n\nEFSA does not have the power to make regulations, though officials will be issuing guidance towards the end of the year.\n\nMeasures could include regulations to limit the level of GE (genetic engineering) in food products, but there will not be a ban on the use of palm oil.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization flagged the same potential risk that EFSA had warned of regarding GE, but did not recommend consumers stop eating palm oil.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration also has not banned the use of palm oil in food.\n\nFor now, Ferrero is taking the opportunity to appeal directly to consumers.\n\nThe hazelnut and chocolate spread, one of Italy's best-known food brands and a popular breakfast treat for children globally, is a dominant voice in the food sector.\n\nFerrero executives are hoping they can use their considerable influence to win over customers.\n\nMeanwhile rivals are opportunistically advertising themselves as 'palm oil-free' - possibly spurring the dent in Nutella's sales.\n\nFerrero said in a statement: ' The health and safety of consumers is an absolute and first priority for Ferrero and we confirm that Ferrero products are safe.\n\n'EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) has analyzed the presence of contaminants in a large number of products and oils stating that the presence of contaminants depends on the oils and fats used as well as the processes they are subjected to.\n\n'It is for this reason that Ferrero carefully selects quality raw materials and applies specific industrial processes that limit their presence to minimum levels, fully in line with the parameters defined by the EFSA.\n\n'In addition, our Quality teams constantly monitor such factors and guarantee the food safety of our products to the consumer.'","http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4108370/nutella-maker-fights-palm-oil-cancer-risk-study.html/","1484118183.0"
"ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry’s Impassioned Plea To ‘Like, Just Co-Exist’\nMAYADIN, SYRIA—Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, “The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.”\n\nThe powerful statement which single-handedly dismantled ISIS came shortly after a terrorist attack on civilians in Manchester killed 22 people, and led the reclusive head of ISIS to hold an emergency press conference declaring the group’s jihad finished.\n\n“Despite my previous belief that we must slay the infidel in the name of Allah until Islam rules the world, I just can’t deny that Katy’s words have touched my heart,” al-Baghdadi said as he symbolically held up and then tossed an AK-47 onto the ground. “It is time for the mujahideen to start uniting and loving on people.”\n\n“I just can’t believe we didn’t see it before. It’s all so clear now,” he added.\n\nAfter the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.\n\nAccording to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.","http://babylonbee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist/","1495652407.0"
"Russian hooker who had sex with Donald Trump mocks his “tiny penis”\nA 22-year sex worker named Ivana Kamensky, claims she was one of the prostitutes who had sexual intercourse with Donald Trump in Moscow in 2011, adding that the American President had the smallest penis she had ever seen.\n\nIn an interview with the Moscow Daily Herald, the young woman described in great details the night that she allegedly spent in Mr. Trump’s hotel room five years ago.\n\nMs. Kamensky claims she was hired by Donald Trump along with two of her friends to perform several degrading sex acts, like urinating on him and on each other.\n\nShe said that she had been shocked by the incredibly small size of his penis, and remembers laughing about it with the other two girls.\n\n“Many parts of his body are too small, not only his hands,” she told the Moscow Daily Herald.\n\n“I’ve slept with hundreds of men and I’ve seen some small penises, but he’s by far the smallest I’ve ever seen.”\n\nShe described Mr.Trump’s genitals as being the size of a grape, barely one inch (2.5cm) long when fully erect.\n\n“We were not surprised when he asked for some unusual stuff, because he was not physically equipped to engage in any kind of normal penetration.”\n\nMs. Kamensky says she was paid $10,000 for her night with Mr. Trump, which is more than the average Russian worker earns in a year.\n\nMs. Kamensky’s claims seem to confirm the unverified allegations about Mr. Trump being caught on film with prostitutes in both Moscow and St Petersburg, causing a scandal already dubbed as the “Golden Shower Gate” by some media.\n\nThe scandal finds its origin in a 35-page dossier compiled by a former MI6 agent, containing unverified allegations that Russian security officials have compromising material on Mr. Trump that could be used to blackmail him.\n\nAccording to the dossier, the Kremlin had been feeding Trump some compromising information on his opponents for years. It had also acquired compromising information on Trump himself that could be used as blackmail.\n\nThere are allegations of “perverted” sex acts and also of frequent contact between Trump’s campaign and Russian government intermediaries.\n\nMr. Trump angrily denied the claims made in the dossier during his first press conference as president-elect.\n\nHe described the allegations as “fake news” and openly criticized the media who had covered the story.\n\nConsidering Mr. Trump’s tendency to react personally to most critics on his Twitter account, it is quite probable that he will react to Ms. Kamensky’s claims over the next few days.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/russian-hooker-who-had-sex-with-donald-trump-mocks-his-tiny-penis/","1484323892.0"
"Same Crisis Actor Hogg In FL and CA, Multiple Retakes For CNN\nThe arrogant left doesn’t even bother to tell their crisis actors to stay off TV in the lead up to their murderous false flag gun confiscation attacks, as the Florida shooting increasingly…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5K Shares\n\n6.5K Shares\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s commonplace for Democrats to be accused of standing on the backs of dead shooting victims to employ crisis actors, particularly when they can use children to condemn Republicans in the name of their murdered classmates.\n\nThe situation with David Hogg is very strange. He was not only chosen, supposedly in the aftermath of the shooting, by the left to be their spokesboy for gun vilification and seizure, but he’s also been on TV recently on the opposite coast, 3,000 miles away in Redondo Beach, California. Either that’s the strangest of coincidences or there’s more to this story.\n\nAs the video shows, he and one of his fellow punks videotaped themselves giving a hard to time to an authority figure, this time a California lifeguard, who the friend of Hogg was disrespectful to and used profanity against. It’s a relatively current video, since the age of Hogg appears to be the same.\n\nMost Americans never get on television but his kid is the focus of two separate incidences on two different coasts on opposite sides of the country in a very short period of time. And with one of them now being the platform for launching him and his buzz cut female counterpart as the spokesboy and spokesgirl for the left’s latest disarmament and confiscation drive, it’s a little more than suspicious. [[VIDEOS BELOW]]\n\nThere are reports that Hogg was a reporter for the school media department, a position he could have been planted into as part of the preparation for the shooting, if in fact it was one of their pre-planned false flag events targeting the American people and our Constitutional rights and innocent children for political gain. Nothing is beyond the possibility or even probability for the anti-American left.\n\nHogg isn’t very good a memorizing his lines, as is shown in the Tweet in which his errors and rambling sentences forces him to restart multiple times, to the point of the video being worthless for anything other than evidence casting doubt on the actor’s legitimacy.\n\nIn the last video of the “confiscation couple” Hogg describes how tired he is, bemoaning the limited amount of sleep he’s gotten with his newfound fame and celebrity as the left’s post-shooting darling. He makes the claim that, “If we could just be nobody still, that’s how I’d prefer it. I would want everybody to be doing this on their own,” claiming that he and his bobble-head dudette co-conspirator have to “sadly, stand up and take charge.”\n\nHe’s making that claim so as to not appear to be enjoying the fame, to bolster his marginal credibility. He may be sad his friends had to die for their political agenda to move forward, and he may wish that it hadn’t had come to this, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t think it was worthwhile or that he wasn’t on standby waiting for the trigger to be pulled on the false flag.\n\nAs the hero of the anti-American left and Hussein Obama, Saul Alinsky, declared, the end justifies the means. It’s the method the left’s evil operatives use to remove any sense of guilt and remorse for what they’ve done and what they’re plotting.\n\nMaybe what they’re telling us is all true – and just maybe, in Redondo Beach and Parkland, pigs can fly.\n\nThere’s a long commercial at the end of the first video you might want to click out of.\n\n﻿\n\nMaybe he should have kept a low profile with the shooting in the near future.\n\nCNN Breathlessly promoting the confiscation march and asking “how are you holding up?”\n\n﻿\n\nIf you’re also fed up with Facebook censorship targeting patriots and America, look for me on GAB at https://gab.ai/RickRWells, and on my website http://RickWells.US – Please SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar at RickWells.US to receive my posts directly by email, safely beyond the censorship of little comrade Zuckerberg.

"JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of “Faking” * 100PercentFedUp.com\nAlabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report.\n\nThe women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.\n\nOne woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore “took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes.”\n\nCorfman told the Post that Moore “touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.”\n\nThe outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying.\n\n“This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,” Moore said.\n\nFormer White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President Trump’s warning that Moore was less electable.\n\nMoore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election. – Washington Examiner\n\nStephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of “faking” things like fake checks for instance…\n\nAccording to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be “fake news, after using mulitple “unnamed sources” in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check.\n\nMs. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown.\n\nMs. McCrummen’s criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19 – False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.\n\nMs. McCrummen’s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states’ criminal courts.

"Pentagon awards contract to United Airlines to forcibly remove Assad — Duffel Blog\n440.4k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nWASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced Tuesday it had awarded a sole-source contract to United Airlines for work related to the forcible removal of President Bashar al-Assad from Syria.\n\nThe contract, worth $2.1 billion, tasks the airline company with locating Assad, grabbing him from his seat in the presidential palace, and “dragging him out of Damascus by his arms.” The contract also notes that Assad should be “asked several times, politely” to give up his seat of power, though if he refuses, United workers should bloody his nose up a bit, according to the posting at FedBizOpps.\n\nThe award comes just days after President Donald Trump authorized the launch of cruise missiles at a Syrian air base, in response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons. Two Navy ships launched 59 Tomahawk missiles into Syria, which destroyed roughly 20% of its operational aircraft and a Green Beans Coffee shop being used by the Russian army.\n\nSoon after the strikes, some in the Trump White House began calling for regime change in Syria. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters that peace in Syria “could not be achieved” with Assad remaining in power.\n\nThough US military officials have struggled in recent months with a plan for removing Assad, United Airlines cleared its final hurdle for the military’s request for proposal on Monday, when it ordered police officers to forcibly remove a passenger from a flight that was overbooked.\n\nMonday’s test run was “more successful than we could have hoped,” said Charlie Hobart, a spokesman for United.\n\nUnited will be sending one of its aircraft to Damascus sometime next week, where it will land and carry out the plan called for in the contract.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether United employees will actually carry out the forcible removal of Assad. One source said it’s possible the company may subcontract that portion of the work requirement to the Chicago Police Department, Wells Fargo, or Comcast.","http://www.duffelblog.com/2017/04/pentagon-awards-contract-united-airlines-forcibly-remove-assad/","1491908406.0"
"Trump’s Wildlife Conservation Council Led By Big Game Hunters Group Who Counts Cecil The Lion Killer As Member\nDonald Trump and his administration are under intense scrutiny once more as people are questioning the credentials of the members of the newly formed International Wildlife Conservation Council. Interestingly, some of the people tasked to provide advice regarding the conservation of wildlife are those who hunt them down as trophies.\n\nThe International Wildlife Conservation Council will hold its first-ever meeting on Friday, and among the members expected to be in attendance include the host of a reality TV safari hunting show, representatives from the gun industry, a controversial veterinarian, a former beauty queen, and members of big game hunters groups, one of which counts the person responsible for the death of Zimbabwe’s famed Cecil the Lion as its member, Mother Jones reported.\n\nThe council is chaired by Steven Chancellor, the coal mining tycoon and an avid supporter of Trump and the Republican Party, according to the Daily Mail. Chancellor is also a big game hunter and his lavish home in Indiana is filled with hundreds of stuffed trophy animals.\n\nOther members of the council include Safari Club International president Paul Babaz. The SCI is an international organization made up of “hunters dedicated to protecting the freedom to hunt.” Walter Palmer, the dentist who killed Cecil the Lion, is one of its 50,000 members. Babaz is also a board member of the National Rifle Association. Two other council members are former lobbyists of the NRA.\n\nPeter Horn, vice president of Beretta USA and co-owner of a private hunting preserve in New York, was also chosen for the council. Ivan Carter, a Zimbabwe native who is a famed hunting guide in Africa, John Jackson, ex-president of a pro-hunting group, along with two well-known American hunting guides are also part of the Trump’s International Wildlife Conservation Council.\n\nTrump’s new International Wildlife Conservation Council is dominated by group who’s most famous member killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe https://t.co/kh9v5c1SX6 — Stephanie Mencimer (@smencimer) March 16, 2018\n\nOlivia Opre is one of four women in the Wildlife Conservation Council. Opre stars in her own reality show, Extreme Huntress. Denise Walker, another council member, was named “Huntress of the Year 2018” by the Houston Safari Club. Council member Erica Rhoad is the director of hunting policy of the NRA. Jenifer Chatfield is a zoo and wildlife veterinarian professor. Her father, John Chatfield, is accused of being involved in the exotic animal trade.\n\nCameron Hanes, a friend of Donald Trump Jr., hosts a hunting TV show. The Wildlife Conservation Council member once said killing elephants and other animals give them “value,” according to the Slot.\n\nAs expected, some groups and individuals expressed their discontent over the members chosen for the council. Masha Kalinina, the international trade policy specialist of Humane Society International, is one of those who are questioning the credentials of the council’s members.\n\nWildlife conservation council created by @Interior @SecretaryZinke stuffed with trophy hunters, including one who co-owns a private hunting preserve with @DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/4dbE1I4UHK — AP Politics (@AP_Politics) March 15, 2018\n\n“It’s embarrassing,” Kalinina said. “I just question the qualifications of each and every one of these people. Notably missing from this trophy hunting council are legitimate representatives of the conversation community with proper scientific credentials and a record of successful conservation programs.”\n\nKalinina also wondered why there were no wildlife law enforcement experts chosen for the council. She also threw shade at some council members when she asked why “biologists who have no financial stake in promoting trophy hunting” were not included.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, himself a hunter, announced the establishment of the International Wildlife Conservation Council last year. The purpose of the council, as stated in a Department of the Interior press release dated November 8, 2017, is to give expert “advice and recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior” and to “focus on increased public awareness domestically regarding conservation, wildlife law enforcement, and economic benefits that result from U.S. citizens travelling abroad to hunt.”","https://www.inquisitr.com/4829806/trumps-wildlife-conservation-council-led-by-big-game-hunters-group-who-counts-cecil-the-lion-killer-as-member/","1521272576.0"
"World’s Most Pierced Person Dies Going Through Airport Metal Detector\n0\n\nLOS ANGELES, California –\n\nIn one of the most bizarre deaths, the Guinness Book of World Record’s ‘most pierced person,’ Gerard M. Rogers, was killed as he attempted to go through a metal detector in Los Angeles’ LAX airport. According to reports, Rogers’ face was completely ripped from his body as soon as he entered the machine.\n\n“We had warned him not to go through, but he said that it should be fine, and that he’s gone through them before,” said LAX spokesman Joey Goldsmith. “I have no idea if he was lying, if this was a suicide, or what the real story is. Regardless, when Mr. Rogers walked through the metal detector, his entire face was peeled off as the piercings ripped out, attracted to the machine.”\n\nGoldsmith says that LAX, and other airports as well, will begin a strict “no piercings” policy for people who go through the metal detector.\n\n“From here on out, any crazy, overly-pierced people will have to get the pat down. It’s just too much of a mess to clean up,” said Goldsmith. “Next time you’re traveling, please, God – just remove the piercings or take a pat down.”\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments","http://empirenews.net/worlds-most-pierced-person-dies-going-through-airport-metal-detector/","None"
"BREAKING: Jerry Jones And The Cowboys Lose Their Biggest Contract For Their Disrespect\nThe Dallas Cowboys, led by owner and traitor to those to whom he owes his freedom, Jerry Jones, lost the title of “America’s Team” along with the respect of millions of fans when they took ma knee to side with thuggery before the National Anthem last night. That decision, to play both sides and continue the divisiveness of Barack Obama, has now cost them dearly.\n\nNike, the largest athletic company and number one sponsor of professional sports in the world, has canceled all dealings with the Dallas Cowboys. Company CEO Isaac P. Freely told Fox Sports:\n\n“To come out on the field and kneel to thugs and criminals just before saluting the flag was a reprehensible move our company won’t easily forgive. The Dallas Cowboys are no longer licensed to wear, display or sell merchandise with the Nike name or logo on it.”\n\nOwner Jerry Jones says he will fight the move, stating that he was showing his players that he was with them but still managed to see that every one of them stood for the National Anthem.\n\nSorry, Jerry, but it isn’t about the National Anthem anymore, it’s about respect.

"BREAKING: Trump Just Signed The Welfare Law We’ve All Been Waiting For\nPresident Trump just signed an executive order that will eliminate millions of deadbeats, drug addicts and scam artists from the welfare roles. No longer will an able-bodied person get free food, liquor, cigarettes, cash and lottery tickets off of the working man’s dime.

"Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: “Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer”\nThe research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the “chief scientist” is supposed to be the leader “among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.” President Donald Trump’s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn’t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.\n\nWhen asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was “proud” he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because “scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.” Asked to elaborate, he said that he was “glad” to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, “disappointed” as to where he was assigned. “While I can certainly appreciate President Trump’s reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I can’t help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,” he said. “I do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, they’re just wasting their time.”\n\n“When I get back home from work – believe me – I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,” Clovis continued. “I’m proud I’m not one of them because they believe in things like evolution and the like. They have no fear from God, no understanding of things that they can’t see, taste, smell, touch or hear. If you ask me, that’s a pretty limited way for one to live their life. And you want to know what the irony is? They’re the ones who keep calling us traditional and conservative. They, who refuse to believe God made man because they found some sort of so-called evidence that man derived from monkeys or whatever. They’re so narrow-minded that they can’t except that we’re different and then they go around calling us the conservatives. It’s funny when you really think about it.”\n\n“That’s why I’m happy I’m not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They don’t even consider the fact that there’s more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. It’s as funny as it is pitiful,” he said. When asked why he continues to work as president Trump’s pick for top scientist if that’s how he feels about it, he replied, “Well, just because you’re a member of the Trump administration doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,” Clovis concluded.\n\nSOURCE\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/05/20/trumps-top-scientist-pick-scientists-just-dumb-regular-people-think-dinosaurs-existed-earth-getting-warmer/","1495252800.0"

"Paul Ryan: “Donald Trump Plans To Resign From Office Within The Next 30 Days”\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — At a press conference early this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days.\n\n“Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,” Ryan told reporters. “Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.”\n\nNews of this comes as Russia’s hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.\n\n“If the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,” Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. “Washington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.”\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.\n\n“We did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you’ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!”\n\n“We think this is the best thing,” Ryan continued. “He has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it’s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.”\n\nAfter word spread of Trump’s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.\n\n“I think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, he’s the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.”\n\nLloyd Glacier, a spokesman for ‘Sock It Forward‘, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trump’s plan to resign.\n\n“This will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.”\n\n38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go.\n\n“When I’m traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours,” Horner said. “Trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now it’s all gone. It looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the Devil is extremely pleased. Just an FYI, you’re all going to burn in Hell for eternity, but Jesus loves you very much! Praise Fappy!”\n\nThe Trump Administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments about Trump’s impending resignation.

"Hollywood Actor Bruce Willis: ‘Trump Is The Best US President Ever, Anyone Who Dislikes Him Should Move To…’\nHollywood actor Bruce Willis once again expressed his unconditional support for President Donald Trump in a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon, although these days it’s very unusual for him to be supported by any Hollywood star.\n\nWhen Willis was asked about his opinion on Trump’s presidency so far he said: “I think that he’s doing great. In fact, he just might be the best US President ever.”\n\nFallon then asked him if he was serious about this statement because it would definitely sound like an exaggeration to many people. Willis responded:\n\n“Yeah I’m being serious about this. Trump has always been a winner and to be honest I can’t think of a better man to lead America at this moment.”\n\nBruce Willis is one the few conservatives in Hollywood who are not afraid to express their support for President Trump. He has always been a fan of Trump and everything that he represents – a successful businessman and a role model for every young American.\n\nWillis added: “Trump has a winning mentality and I believe that every American can identify with that. He is the guy that we need right now and I think that we should all settle our differences and support him.”\n\nHowever Willis is bothered by the attitude of many American politicians and stars who spend their time criticizing Trump. He said: “Before every election so far there were debates and fighting between candidates. But, once we had a winner everybody just stood behind the elected President. Now we see that the fighting and conflict continue long after the 2016 election. I don’t like that. It doesn’t look good. If you don’t like him go to Canada or something.”\n\nDo you agree with him?

"Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies. Be careful with this, moms!\nIt might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.\n\nBut this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.\n\nA Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.\n\nWhen she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.\n\nShe rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.\n\nShe was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.\n\nShe carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.\n\nThe medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.\n\nShe never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.\n\nThe thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.\n\nThe label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.\n\nSadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.\n\nWe must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.","http://smag31.com/mom-applies-remedy-baby-moments-later-dies-careful-moms/","1480092005.0"

"UPDATE: ATF Disputes GotNews Source On Las Vegas Shooting\nThe ATF has disputed GotNews’ source, saying “the information in the article is incorrect,” in the following article on a theory regarding the Las Vegas shooting. “Please know that the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is the lead of the investigation of the shooting in Las Vegas and ATF is assisting. This is an ongoing investigation where we continue to work with our law enforcement partners,” the ATF said. This article will continue to be updated with developments. If you have any tips, email editor@gotnews.com ______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAn interesting – albeit unconfirmed – theory regarding the Las Vegas shooting has emerged, with a new report alleging the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) now believes gunman Stephen Paddock likely had help planning and executing the deadliest mass shooting in US history from none other than the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino security guard who was shot in the leg that night.\n\nJesus Campos has been praised for his apparent heroics on October 1st, as he supposedly rushed to Paddock’s suite, was shot in the upper thigh through the door, and continued to help get people to safety despite his wounds. However, a senior ATF official involved in the investigation now believes he was likely an accomplice of Paddock’s, and may have even been involved in the initial shooting as a second gunman from the other broken window in Paddock’s 32nd-floor room.\n\nAccording to an ATF official, these suspicions are corroborated by the extreme amount of gunpowder residue found on Campos’ hands. “They believe he killed Paddock, shot holes through the door and his own arm to produce physical evidence for his cover story, then went and lay next to the elevator,” a senior ATF official doing ballistic work for the shooting told GotNews.\n\nThis account would be consistent with leaked photos of Paddock’s dead body, which show casings on top of Paddock’s blood. Such a scenario would seem unlikely if Paddock had shot himself:\n\nYou won’t hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media. Keep the GotNews mission alive: donate at GotNews.com/donate or send tips to editor@gotnews.com. If you’d like to join our research team, contact editor@gotnews.com.\n\nLas Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo has publicly said that he believes Paddock had “some help at some point.” This follows citizen journalist Laura Loomer‘s scoop that Paddock ordered room service for two people during his stay in the hotel.\n\nAuthorities have similarly been piecing together information that shines light on the sophistication of the attack. “Paddock also had an electronic signal jamming device active and that is why the cameras were all out on the floor,” the ATF official explained.\n\nMoreover, it appears the 64-year-old multimillionaire also plotted his attack well in advance: “Paddock at a minimum scouted out two separate music concerts, one being the EDC [Electric Daisy Carnival] and the other held at the Life is Beautiful venue plaza by Fremont, but didn’t pull the trigger,” the ATF senior official told GotNews. “Paddock had big plans, and didn’t plan on dying in the hotel room.” ABC News recently reported that Paddock had previously booked a hotel room overlooking Lollapalooza, and visited other musical festivals, presumably to scout for potential targets.\n\n“Paddock also bought 60 guns total from at least 20 different gun stores, and he only visited them each once,” the official said. The ATF is looking into the real estate investor’s mysterious background, and so far has yet to reach a conclusion. A source familiar with the investigation told GotNews he “believes [Paddock] was an illegal gun broker or possibly working for a three letter agency to catch real criminals who are trying to buy illegal guns.”\n\nSpeculation that Paddock may have been an arms dealer has increased in recent days, in part due to a bizarre television interview his younger brother Eric gave, in which he discussed his brother’s background:\n\n“People are saying ‘oh, he must’ve had help.’ Steve had no help. Steve didn’t take help. It did not take a village for Steve. Steve was an arm–,” Eric Paddock says in the strange clip, before awkwardly pausing, apparently catching himself. “I’m sorry. Please, don’t…”\n\nCampos could not be reached for comment, and it should be noted that initial reports are often wrong or incomplete.\n\nSince the publication of the article, the ATF contacted GotNews and said the article is incorrect\n\nStay tuned for more.\n\nOur researchers shut down Facebook’s biased left-wing trending news team.

While Ivanka Trump is quick to point out that she doesn’t directly solicit donations, the fact remains that President Trump is a huge fan of his daughter’s project, and countries seeking to curry favor with the Trump administration could hypothetically write a check to his daughter’s entrepreneurship fund.\n\nKushner’s arms deal with the Saudi government would supply the kingdom with new aerial defense systems by Lockheed Martin, in addition to new tanks, combat ships, and fighter jets.\n\nSaudi Arabia is currently engaged in an ongoing war with Yemen, which has stirred up international controversy and condemnation from human rights watchdogs.\n\nIn March, Human Rights Watch referred to a Saudi-led attack on a refugee boat leaving the coast of Yemen as a war crime, when gunfire from a helicopter killed at least 32 civilians, and wounded another 29 (including six children).\n\nKevin Wallace is a journalist with five years’ experience in print and digital media, and covers politics, media, and culture for the Resistance Report.

"James Comey Taken From His Home By Feds At 3AM\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 1.9k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nReports have come in from several sources near the scene that James Comey was taken from his home last night at about 3AM by what appeared to be a very proficient team of federal agents. A neighbor told LLOD’s Skip Tetheluda:\n\n“I saw 4 or 5 black GMC SUVs with US Government plates pull up in front of Jim’s house. I went out to see what they were doing and they told me they were Secret Service and to go back inside and ‘shelter in place.’ Four or five minutes they came out with Jim in boxers and a t shirt, hancuffed with a bag over his head. The SUV with Jim in it sped away and the others stayed and you could hear them tearing the place apart.”\n\nComey is, of course, the former head of the FBI who was fired for doing a terrible job. Considering this was the Secret Service, theories emerging say that Comey may have been caught in a revenge plot against Trump, the agency or any number of individuals who turned their backs on him after he betrayed his country.\n\nThis is a developing story that will be updated.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/james-comey-taken-from-his-home-by-feds-at-3am/","1499007385.0"
"Donna Brazile knows Seth Rich was murdered by the Clintons\nFormer interim head of the Democratic National Committee and long-time Democratic operative Donna Brazile wrote in an upcoming book due out this week that she feared for her life in the days and weeks after DNC tech worker Seth Rich was murdered last year as he walked home late from a local bar in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Internet guru Matt Drudge, Brazile also shut her blinds so that snipers could not see her.\n\n“Brazile writes she was haunted by the murder of DNC Seth Rich, and feared for her own life, shutting the blinds so snipers could not see her,” Drudge tweeted.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DRUDGE/status/926892115044343808\n\nHer book, titled, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House,” is slated to be released on Tuesday.\n\nWhy would Brazile have to fear for her life after the Rich murder — if, as we’ve been told, it was simply a robbery gone bad? Does she suspect someone of the murder?\n\nDoes she suspect the Clintons? (Related: STORM: ‘Complete panic’ at DNC after Kim Dotcom says he was in on Seth Rich’s effort to get stolen docs to WikiLeaks.)\n\nConsider some things before you dismiss that conspiracy theory out of hand.\n\n— As The Blaze noted, Drudge’s tweet got no small amount of attention, earning more than 13,000 retweets and tens of thousands of “likes.”\n\nSeveral news websites have reported for months regarding Seth’s murder, even as the so-called “mainstream media” has all but ignored the murder. In fact, when the MSM discusses Rich at all these days, it’s usually to mock the alternative news site reporting on the latest development (like this one).\n\nThe fact that the murder impacted Brazile in such a way that she would put it in her book lends much new credence to the suspicion that his death was somehow tied to politics.\n\n— Also, Brazile heavily criticized Hillary Clinton in her book, claiming that she essentially took over the DNC, used it as her campaign’s own personal fundraising vehicle, and only gave the organization a stipend with which to live on, NewsTarget reported last week.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, Brazile said Clinton left the DNC penniless and heavily in debt.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who ran the organization at the time, “was not a good manager,” Brazile wrote in Politico, in which she discussed Clinton’s “secret takeover” of the party. “She hadn’t been very interested in controlling the party — she let Clinton’s headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn’t have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was.”\n\n— When Brazile took over the DNC on an interim basis after Wasserman Schultz was fired, she discovered evidence that Clinton, the Florida congresswoman and the party leaders conspired to rig the nomination process in favor of Hillary, essentially cheating her primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., out of it.\n\nShe said she discovered a joint fundraising agreement “between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.” At that point, Brazile figured out that the DNC had been subjugated by the Clinton campaign almost a full year before Hillary actually got the nomination.\n\n“The agreement — signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to [lawyer] Marc Elias — specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised,” Brazile said.\n\n“Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings,” she noted further.\n\nIs Brazile’s insider, tell-all book naming Clinton as being responsible for taking over the DNC, perhaps illegally, her way of protecting herself in the wake of Rich’s murder? You could certainly make that argument.\n\nJ. D. Heyes is a senior writer for NewsTarget.com and editor-in-chief of The National Sentinel.\n\nSources include:\n\nNewsTarget.com\n\nTheBlaze.com","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspolitical.org/donna-brazile-knows-seth-rich-was-murdered-by-the-clintons/","1510156374.0"

"Obama Secretly Flees US – Leaves Stunning Evidence Behind\nBREAKING: Barack Obama just secretly fled the U.S. after Donald Trump found some disturbing criminal evidence he left behind in the Oval Office. This prompted Trump to send a massive warning to Obama and his deep state minions that they won’t soon forget!\n\nMad World News reported that Obama just jetted off to New Zealand this week, and he immediately imposed a strict ban on the media covering the events he plans to hold there. It should come as no surprise that Obama chose to leave the country right now, however, as the heat was just turned up on his deep state after the firing of now former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n\nIn the wake of this firing, it was confirmed that Obama left behind a trail of damning evidence inside the Oval Office. The evidence proves that it was actually the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to thwart then-candidate Donald Trump during the presidential election, and they didn’t cover their tracks well enough.\n\nThe members of Obama’s deep state that took part in this plan included ormer FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the DOJ National Security Division. Monaco slipped up and left an evidence trail going from the illegal unmasking of US citizens being done, Trump and his campaign people, under the illegal FISA warrants, back to the Oval Office via the “Presidential Daily Briefings” (PDB).\n\n“During the 2015/2016 presidential election, Lisa Monaco was one of the key WH figures doing the unmasking of raw intelligence provided by the ‘small group’ collaborators (with Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes). Monaco was also one of the key policy strategists, heck, she was the architect, who utilized the compartmentalization of intelligence to hide the fingerprints of collaboration. This was the issue that initially stymied HSPCI Devin Nunes,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.\n\nNunes eventually found Obama’s PDBs which have all the illegal FISA activity and other illegal spy games targeting Trump.\n\n“Nunes stated the intelligence product he reviewed was ‘not related to Russia, or the FBI Russian counter-intelligence investigation.’ So the product itself was likely a product for the President, that was not part of the ongoing FBI counter-intel product,” reported The Conservative Treehouse.\n\nThese PDBs prove Obama was in on this from the very beginning, and he hasn’t stopped trying to take Trump down since then. Last month, Obama and his deep state set up a website called “National Security Action,” who says their mission is, “Under President Trump’s reckless leadership, the United States is weaker in the world, less safe, and more isolated. He is retreating from the world stage, undercutting the intelligence and law enforcement agencies that keep us safe, undermining the diplomacy that prevents wars, insulting our allies, attacking democratic traditions, and cozying up to dictators while abandoning America’s commitment to universal rights and human dignity.”\n\nThese people are just trying to get Trump impeached so they can swoop in and take back the White House as soon as he is out of it. Unfortunately for them, however, McCabe’s firing makes it clear that they won’t get away with this act of treason.\n\nWhat do you think about this?

"Hillary Clinton Will Read The Audiobook Version Of “Fire and Fury”\n40.9k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK — Alinsky Talent Agency announced this morning that one of their stable of stars has been tapped to record the audiobook version of author Michael Wolff’s bombshell investigative tell-all book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.”\n\n“ATA is pleased to announce that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will be reading the audiobook version of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” a press release from the agency reads. “Hillary is experienced in recording audiobooks, having read the narration to a book or two of her own in the past. She is very much so looking forward to this opportunity.”\n\nPresident Trump has lambasted the book, which contains a number of explosive and embarrassing facts about him, his family, his aides, his campaign, and his first year in office. Word of the book first hit the public’s attention when an excerpt from it, in which Steve Bannon — a man that Trump once credited with helping him win the election — is quoted as saying the meeting in the summer of 2016 between Trump’s son, son-in-law, Bannon, and Russian lawyers claiming to have dirt on Clinton was “treasonous.”\n\nExcerpts from the book paint a picture of a White House in total chaos. It portrays Trump as a borderline delusional man who lashes out, gets stuck in rhetorical loops, and cannot help himself from tweeting incendiary things, often over the advice of advisers in the administration. Trump took to Twitter yesterday to blast the book and Steve Bannon.\n\nI authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2018\n\nMs. Clinton is not taking any payment for this job, the press release states, despite being a celebrity with a big enough name to command an easy six-figure or more sum for the work.\n\n“Secretary Clinton believes in doing charitable work that helps lift humanity up in times of tumult and insecurity,” the press release states. “So she will not be taking a single dime for this gig, as she believes she is truly doing God’s work, if you believe in God. If you don’t, then let’s just call it trolling. And Hill-dawg loves to troll a troll.”\n\nThe White House was not reached for comment, but a loud yelling noise was heard from the Oval Office and a palette of Diet Coke was catapulted out onto the front lawn shortly after publication.\n\nYou can read satire like this every day on The Political Garbage Chute and Alternative Facts.\n\nMore satire:\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://pastichepost.com/2018/01/05/hillary-clinton-audiobook-fire-and-fury/","1515128400.0"

"Female Legislators Unveil ‘Male Ejaculation Bill’ Forbidding The Disposal Of Unused Semen\nWASHINGTON, DC (By J. McConkey)—A group of leading female legislators have enacted a new bill that forbids American men from disposing of “unused” sperm, requiring them to bring any recreational semen to a nearby fertility clinic.\n\nAccording to noted alternative facts specialist, Stephanie Yorke, sperm is intended for “procreation only” and not to be “wasted” on pleasure:\n\n“Any sperm not being used for the purpose of procreation must be immediately donated to a sperm bank,” Yorke warned. “Failure to do so will lead to hefty fines and ultimately, incarceration, under the new ‘Level Playing Field Bill’.”\n\nBREAKING: Trump Reveals Plans To Build Bridge With Russia; Insists Putin Will Pay Later\n\nIn response, leading male medical academics have raised concerns that refraining from masturbation would be hazardous to men’s testicular health, increasing their chances of prostate cancer.\n\nDr. David Ambrose hit out at the bill, claiming it put American men in the very difficult position of having to father and immediately surrender a child, everytime they ejaculate. He claims this will have very negative effects on men’s long-term mental health.\n\n“Basically, men have been put in a position of having to choose between their health and enjoyment and having to give away their child if they’re not having sex for procreation,” Dr. Ambrose said.\n\n“It’s deeply disturbing and quite invasive to the most personal part of a man’s life,” he added. “Not only that, but if they don’t have a safe or legal way to dispose of the semen, they may resort to more harmful and unhygienic ways of getting rid of it.”\n\nSEE MORE: Obama Wakes Up To 37 Missed Calls From Oval Office On First Day As Regular Citizen\n\nOne 15 year old boy in Ohio, with severe pelvic and testicular congestion which if untreated could prove fatal, has begged doctors to allow him to ejaculate and dispose of his secretions without having to donate his sperm. His physician, Dr. Sheila Burton, has repeatedly explained to the boy that his unconceived child is more important than his own life, and he must either endure the pain or face giving away his unborn child.\n\nWhen asked why women in government had the right to make this decision on behalf of men or why the government should be regulating men’s reproductive rights at all, the female officials replied, “sorry, it came from above”.\n\n“Men exist to produce babies. If they want to experience pleasure, they’ll just have to endure the consequences. We wish there was another way, we truly do, but our hands are tied.

"UPDATE: 82-Year-Old Who Killed A Muslim In Self-Defense Gets The Death Penalty\n82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.\n\nThe men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.\n\nNow, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.\n\nProsecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:\n\n“Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial. While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull. Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”\n\nReligious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California?\n\nDeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.”\n\nDeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://ladiesofliberty.net/update-82-year-old-who-killed-a-muslim-in-self-defense-gets-the-death-penalty/","1512746766.0"
"Bachmann: “White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery”\nOn Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has “sanctioned” violence, as long it protects the “people favorable to the Obama position, politically.” She insisted that the president is sending “a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don’t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.” She also linked the Obama administration’s “lawlessness” to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving “normal” people helpless in the face of anarchy.\n\n“And these days it has become so obvious that I’m honestly surprised we’re not having riots throughout the country,” she said. “When did this become a nation of criminals? I didn’t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I’m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.”\n\nThe ex-Rep. then argued that “not even slaves” suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. “It’s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I’m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear – we’re supposed to be all evolved right now, we’re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He’s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you’ve seen in Minneapolis.”\n\n“In fact,” Bachmann continued firing, “I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama’s presidency.” She added, “Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does.”\n\n“And let’s get one thing straight – I’m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I’d be saying the same thing all over again,” Bachmann quipped. “That’s what I’m trying to point out – white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I’m seriously worried whether or not we’ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we’re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we’ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another – white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that’s just one step away from extinction,” Bachmann concluded./politicot.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/","1499400000.0"

"Betsy DeVos Orders Immediate Flattening Of All School Globes\nYou can read more satirical news items like this every day on The Political Garbage Chute.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Upon hearing of her extremely narrow Senate confirmation, newly confirmed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued an order that all globes being used in any American school are to be 'flattened like God made it just 6,000 years ago.'\n\nDeVos was confirmed in the Senate 51-50, with the deciding vote being cast by Vice President, and 2015 winner of the 'Lantern-Jawed Bigot of the Year Award' from 'Christofascists Weekly,' Mike Pence. When Pence broke the tie, it was the first time since 2008 that a Senate vote had to be broken in such a way. Perhaps most notably, this was the first time in our nation's 240-year history that a cabinet member had to be confirmed in such a way.\n\n'Sure, I was literally dragged across the finish line by Vice President Pence,' DeVos said in an email to the DOE staffers directing the globe flattening edict, 'but elections have consequences.

"BREAKING: Black Lives Matter Leader Kept ‘Virtually All’ Donations\nYou may remember the inspiring story the liberal media pushed of a homeless black woman who became one of the most prominent members of Black Lives Matter, organizing over 900 events and taking in millions in donations that were supposed to help “raise black men and women” up in society. But Marquesha Johnson isn’t the woman the mainstream media said, and those donations only helped raise one black up: herself.\n\nAccording to a class action lawsuit filed Wednesday, Johnson “solicited donations from vulnerable people to help others but instead used it to help herself.”\n\nThe documents filed Tuesday claim that Johnson bought herself a $1.2 million home as well as a Range rover and “other exorbitancies” rather than use her ill-gotten gains to help people.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s likely that what she did was perfectly legal because she solicited the funds through a GoFundMe campaign and the company is notoriously bad at working with police to crack down on scammers.\n\nJohnson was questioned by police, but denies misusing funds. She refuses to hand over records.\n\nAs Johnson enjoys her money, blacks across America continue to suffer poverty, gang culture, and more.\n\nI hope she’s pleased with herself.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://reaganwasright.com/2017/11/14/breaking-black-lives-matter-leader-kept-virtually-all-donations/","1510635600.0"
"Elderly woman accused of training her 65 cats to steal from neighbors\nColumbus, Ohio | An 83-year old woman was arrested this morning and accused of training dozens of cats to steal jewelry and other valuables from her neighbors.\n\nThe Columbus Police Department opened an investigation on Ruth Gregson and her 65 cats in October after several neighbors reported small objects being stolen from their homes.\n\nSeveral victims reported being visited by Ms. Gregson’s cats before noticing the disappearance of several shiny objects, like valuable cutlery and pieces of jewelry.\n\nDespite their skepticism, investigators began a surveillance operation and were amazed by what they discovered.\n\nAccording to Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs, dozens of cats were constantly coming and going, bringing home “anything that shined”.\n\n“She was like Fagin in Oliver Twist, but she was using cats as thieves instead of children. In less than three hours of surveillance, the detectives saw the cats bring home more than a hundred objects.”\n\nUpon searching Ms. Gregson’s house, investigators found $650,000 worth of jewelry and precious metal among piles of worthless shiny baubles.\n\nA total of 65 adult cats and 17 kittens were found on the site and entrusted to the Columbus Humane Society.\n\nChief Jacobs says the elderly woman confessed to training her cats to steal, saying the felines had to “earn their meals”.\n\n“She would only feed the animals if they brought home valuables, so the animals had to steal every day in order to survive. Most were voluntarily malnurished so they would easily gain the neighbors’ pity and be allowed inside their houses.”\n\nAccording to the Columbus Police, Ms. Gregson’s animals could have stolen from more than 5,000 houses and apartment in the area, and investigators invite possible victims to contact them.\n\nWhile Ms. Gregson is the first person in American history to be accused of training cats to steal, this isn’t the first time that animals are trained to commit crimes.\n\nIn 2009, a surveillance that caught a monkey stealing hundreds of dollars worth of plants from a Texas nursery.\n\nAt the time, the police and store owners had hypothesized that the monkey had been trained to take the plants and hand them over a fence to a waiting human accomplice.\n\nIn 2013, a Chicago court sentenced a man to five years in prison for training ferrets to steal cell phones from people on the street and on public buses.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/elderly-woman-accused-of-training-her-65-cats-to-steal-from-neighbors/","1509717936.0"
"Man accused of ejaculating in his boss’ coffee everyday for 4 years\nNewark, New Jersey | A man was arrested on his work site this morning after it was discovered that he was ejaculating in his employer’s coffee every morning.\n\n38-year old Lewis Williams spent the last four years working as the personal assistant of Ms. Linda Moore, executive president of the DANCO engineering firm.\n\nAmong his tasks as Ms. Moore’s assistant, he was to take her phone calls, set her schedule and bring her a cup of coffee to her desk every day when she arrived at work.\n\nAfter a dispute with his boss this morning, Mr. Williams admitted in front of a dozen coworkers, that he had ejaculated in her coffee “hundreds of time”.\n\nAccording to Brian Little, an intern who witnessed the entire scene, Lewis Williams showed no remorse while he confessed his crime.\n\n“He almost looked proud when he told her: ‘I’ve been eating your shit for four years, but all this time, you’ve been drinking my cum!’ He then smiled and explained everything.”\n\nThe angry employee explained that he had been putting “extra cream” in Ms. Moore’s coffee, five days a week and over many years.\n\nAfter his confession, his colleagues called the police and Mr. Williams was arrested on the site.\n\nA total of 910 criminal charges has been filed against him, including 860 charges of sexual assault. If found guilty on all charges, he could face up to 1070 years in prison.\n\nLewis William’s motivations when he committed his crimes remain unclear, but there certainly was some animosity between him and his boss.\n\nSome of his colleagues have told reporters that he was deeply misogynic and found it humiliating to take orders from a woman all day.\n\nSome other employees, however, have suggested that Ms. Moore was often “aggressive, dominating and verbally abusive” with the accused and he may have acted as some sort of “self-defense”.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/man-accused-of-ejaculating-in-his-boss-coffee-everyday-for-4-years/","1495225898.0"

"Army’s new 'Holistic Medics' treat gunshot wounds with crystals, essential oils — Duffel Blog\n78.6k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nFORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas — In an effort to match the broad range of medical treatments available to the civilian population, the U.S. Army has introduced a new breed of battlefield medic, the service announced Friday.\n\nThe new MOS, Complementary Medicine Specialist (69W), or “holistic medic,” will be trained in a variety of alternative medical treatments, ranging from aromatherapy to interventional prayer, and will be authorized to prescribe medications like megavitamins and homeopathic dilutions.\n\n“There’s great demand for treating warfighter injuries with more natural, holistic remedies,” said Col. Thomas Sorrenson, commander of the new program. “So where a traditional combat medic treats an amputated limb with a tourniquet and hemostatic gauze, our protocol opts for a healing-hands reiki session followed by some cleansing herbs.”\n\n“It’s a more integrative approach,” he said. “After all, what’s really more important: stopping massive blood loss and preventing shock, or curing a devastating disruption of a soldier’s chi?”\n\nIn lieu of conventional trauma supplies like bandages, tourniquets, and chest seals, holistic medics’ aid bags will be stocked with colon cleanse kits, prayer beads, and ginkgo biloba auto-injectors.\n\nSgt. 1st Class Nick Bye, an instructor in the holistic medic course, told Duffel Blog that the training to become a 69W is intense.\n\n“The course includes both lecture and hands-on instruction,” said Bye. “Holistic medics have to not only know their pharmacology, such as which essential oils to use for local anesthesia, but also practical skills, like stopping a sucking chest wound in under 30 seconds through the power of positive thinking.”\n\n“Sure, some have dismissed our methods as ‘pseudoscience,’ but we’ve demonstrated a 100% success rate,” he added with a confident smile. “We haven’t lost a training mannequin yet.”\n\nAt Brooke Army Medical Center, the force is already witnessing the effects of the new methods of care.\n\n“Pretty sure I broke my ankle fast-roping from a UH-60, so I thought I’d be getting some X-rays and painkillers today,” Spc. Timothy Steiner told reporters from a hospital bed. “Instead this dude puts some magnets next to my leg and says that we just need to ‘redirect my body’s vital energy field.’”\n\n“Then he said he’d order some healing crystals and left the room,” he continued. “I really hope ‘crystals’ is some kind of doctor talk for Percocet.

She added: “We need protein for maintenance and growth of muscles and tissue in our body, we need vitamins, we need minerals. “Sailors got scurvy in the 1700s because they didn’t have enough vitamin C. “So if you don’t eat vitamin C your teeth fall out and your wounds don’t heal. “There would be very visible signs – we have all seen those tragic pictures of children with malnutrition in countries where they have famine. “If they were surviving on very little food they would have deficiency symptoms, it is just fact. “It is not possible to survive as a breatharian.” Amanda added that a lack of vital nutrients and minerals and malnutrition causes a woman’s periods to stop, preventing her from becoming pregnant. “Your body would have protected itself against a pregnancy because you wouldn’t be able to sustain one,” she added.\n\nNews Dog Media 11 Akahi and Camila believe humans can be sustained solely by the energy of the universe\n\n“I never suffer from PMS symptoms anymore and I feel more emotionally stable.”\n\nHusband Akahi, 36, believes that Breatharianism is the ideal way to slash people’s food shopping bills.\n\nAkahi – who teaches courses about Breatharianism with his wife, Camila – explained: “There is a freedom that comes with not being attached or dependent on food.\n\nNews Dog Media 11 Camila even practiced a Breatharian pregnancy, not eating anything during the entire nine months that she carried her first child\n\n“Obviously, our living costs are a lot less than most families and that has allowed us to spend our money on things that really matter like travelling and exploring together.\n\n“It’s given us a clear sense of what we want in life.

"BREAKING: SCOTUS Upholds 1952 Law Outlawing Islam In Government – Daily\nCongress passed a law in 1952 that disallowed Muslims from participating in American government because in order to practice Islam you have to practice Sharia Law, which is governing law. Here in America, that is the ultimate conflict of interest.\n\nThe law was tucked away until 2009, when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals put a secret hush on it to allow Barack Obama to be President. After that, Muslims started running for office left and right, leading to a Senator, 2 congressmen, 5 mayors and a governor all belonging to the Islamic faith.\n\nThe Supreme Court finally weighed in and reversed the 9th Circuit’s injunction, stating that the law was written to “protect religious freedom as much as defend it.” and that the court would be hearing the full case sometime in 2018.\n\nUntil then, Muslims in government are once again considered illegal, which will undoubtedly lead to a whole slew of court battles. In the end, they can’t be allowed to govern unless they renounce their faith and their belief in Sharia Law, which to a Muslim is the worst thing imaginable. It would be like asking a Christian to condone killing.\n\nThe Justice Department will begin preparing an amicus brief that will show the damage Muslims in government have caused over the last decade, including canceling Christmas, allowing domestic abusers and rapists to go free and allowing a man to take his 4 American children in the middle of the night to Afghanistan where they were sold into slavery.\n\nThose aren’t the kinds of things we allow in America.

"BREAKING: 3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 2.5k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nLiberals have been going nuts ever since their hero, the criminal Hillary Clinton, lost the election. They just can’t believe that Donald trump, a man who stole the hearts of a huge majority of Americans, won in such a landslide. Even though the people have spoken, liberals think they should get their way. Their heroes, a bunch of tree-hugging Hollywood celebrities, have been leading that charge whenever possible.\n\nThis morning, new details came out that are shocking even to conservatives. The Secret Service has arrested three liberal celebrities in an apparent conspiracy to assassinate the president. You heard that right. They aren’t protesting and they didn’t just make threats, they were actually conspiring to kill President Trump.\n\nSpecial Agent Lucas Kimball, head of the Secret Service task force on credible threats against the president, told Breitbart:\n\n“This was a real plan to not only murder a sitting president but to take half a building and most likely a lot of other innocent lives with him. We were surprised that these three people were capable of such evil thoughts. They insist that they will be remembered by history as the people who tried to ‘stop the next Hitler.'”\n\nLiberalism is, in fact, a mental disorder. The three liberals were arrested as enemy combatants and brought to a military base due to the threat of mass destruction by means that are being called domestic terrorism. The Secret Service turned them over to CIA interrogators and weren’t going to release their names, but after just a few minutes of enhanced interrogation, all three cracked and gave up anyone involved.\n\nThe three to be charged with terrorist threats, conspiracy to commit murder and treason are Actors Seth Rogan and James Franco and singer/songwriter Miley Cyrus. All three will be arraigned in federal court Monday morning. They implicated more than a dozen others who will face conspiracy charges but those names aren’t being released until they’ve been picked up and interrogated themselves to see just how far this thing goes.\n\nJeff Derpinger, from the White House Office of Information and Propaganda, says the president is safely sheltered in place for now until the threat has been neutralized.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/liberals-going-to-jail/","1491054377.0"
"Twitter Deletes Donald Trump’s Twitter Account: “We Will Not Tolerate Racism & Hate”\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Twitter announced today that it will delete Donald Trump’s account sometime within the next 48 hours because of what the company calls “Trump’s racist and divisive rhetoric”.\n\n“Twitter will not tolerate active users, whose only message is one of hate, racism and intolerance. Donald Trump may have been elected to the White House, but at least someone can stand up to him, for the American people and say, ‘No Mr. Trump, we are not with you,'” Paul Horner, a spokesman for Twitter told reporters. “Everything he stands for is backwards. His appointment of racist Steve Bannon, the way he unites hate for the Muslim people in this country, his support of white power organizations. He appointed a cabinet full of billionaires and millionaires to standup for the lower and middle class. The person he puts in charge of the EPA denies climate change. His person in charge of education doesn’t believe in public education. The American people should not accept this. The children of this country deserve a leader who will build a successful future for them. Twitter will not aid and abet him as he makes a mockery of the Presidency. We have no choice but to delete his account.”\n\nPresident-elect Trump released an official response in which he called the company’s plan “laughable” and advised the people at Twitter to “tread lightly, because [he] is already working with [his] attorneys to resolve the situation,” a situation that Mr. Trump says will end “very badly” for anyone who tries to silence him.\n\nA source close to the Trump transition team has told CNN News that President-elect Trump has already set up a new Twitter account, @WHDonaldTrump, which the president-elect plans to begin using immediately after Twitter shuts down his primary account. That same source also said that if Twitter shuts down that account, he will simply keep making more new accounts.\n\nTrump won the general election thanks in large part to the enthusiastic support that he received from the alt-right, a blanket term given to a right wing political faction that includes people from the white supremacist and white nationalist movements. Twitter says they have already deleted several profiles belonging to members of the group.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.\n\n“This is a story about Donald Trump’s Twitter account being deleted.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much .”\n\nCassandra Schmidt, a professor of political science at Northern Arizona University, says that she finds the entire situation very troubling.\n\n“Clearly, you have a man in Donald Trump who is dangerously incompetent and is a clear threat to everything this country stands for. His rhetoric on everything from immigration to the first amendment is terrifying, but I’m still worried about what Twitter is doing from a freedom of speech perspective. Donald Trump may be vile, but even Nazis are protected by the first amendment. I think that by deleting his account, they will only be turning him into a digital martyr. As a society we have a moral duty to confront and disarm bigotry, but I don’t think this is the right way to do it.”\n\nLike Professor Schmidt, Trump supporter Lawrence Ketchum believes that Twitter is violating the President-elect’s freedom of speech.\n\n“Does Twitter seriously think that they can silence Donald Trump by deleting his account?” Ketchum said. “Donald Trump is going to be the next president, and regardless of what the people at Twitter or other liberal elites try to do, Donald Trump has the ears of the American people. The only thing Twitter is doing here is proving that they don’t care about freedom of speech.”\n\nConcerns from critics have done little to weaken Twitter’s resolve, however. CEO Jack Dorsey fired back at critics and doubled down on the company’s plan to ban President-elect Trump.\n\n“Some people are saying that this is a freedom of speech issue, that we’re simply trying to silence people who disagree with us. This is not the case. As a private entity, Twitter has every right to ban abusive users. We expect all individuals who use Twitter to abide by certain behavioral expectations along with our terms and conditions. Donald Trump has failed to meet these expectations time and time again.

"Trump Orders to Remove Obama Highway Name and Put This New Highway Name ? Do you support him?\nSometimes most of us rush to disregard the importance of names. With so many new things being created every day, things of the past can be perceived as “less relevant”. But, it’s for this same reason that names also have one valuable role. They allow us to preserve our legacy and heritage.\n\nHighway located in Riviera Beach, Florida is officially being renamed as “President Barack Obama Highway”.\n\nOver the last few months, we have heard how liberals have tried to desecrate the history of our ancestors by trying to remove Confederate monuments from our cities. Now they are going a step further and they are trying to remove the name “Dixie” from our history.\n\nHighway located in Riviera Beach, Florida is officially being renamed as “President Barack Obama Highway”. The change was decided after city officials concluded the old name was “racist and offensive”. They believe that by changing it to “Obama”, they will get a clean slate on history.\n\n“(The street is) symbolic of racism, symbolic of the clan, symbolic of cross burnings and today we are stepping up to a new day, a new era,” said the mayor of Riviera Beach.\n\nWhile it was indeed true that in the past there was some KKK activity in the Riviera Beach and the major may want to distance themselves from that. To believe that they can hold the name “Dixie “accountable for such history borders between insult and stupidity.\n\nThere is nothing racist with either “Dixie” or Confederate monuments. They are part of the American history and are part of a rich culture that goes beyond whatever bad liberals may want to attach to it.\n\nTo arbitrarily decide that President Obama may be more relevant to American History than hundreds of years of heritage is ludicrous. On top of that, Obama has never done anything for equality in America.\n\nObama’s self-claim of representing “African Americans” while sharing no heritage or culture has probably been the most racist proclamation of modern politics.\n\nFor those who believe he is a role model for Afro Americans. He was raised by outside the country, and his black heritage comes from his Kenyan father who abandoned him. He was raised by a white couple and never understood any of the racial conflicts in this country.\n\nIt’s time that people stopped trying to use public stunts like this to “foster unity”. A real sense of unity can only come from sharing common goals and improving together throughout generations. Renaming a heritage street with the name of the worst president of American History is not proof of anything.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://journalunited.com/2018/01/trump-orders-to-remove-obama/","1514981873.0"
"BREAKING: President Trump’s Latest Executive Order Will Make Retirees VERY Happy\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 16.1k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nPresident Trump has been working diligently behind the scenes to make sure every retiree in America has the kind of security Obama worked so hard to take away. During the reign of the Kenyan tyrant, taxes on Social Security income rose 4 percent while cost of living increases virtually disappeared, leaving far too many with less than they needed to survive.\n\nAt the same time, Medicare was also torn to pieces and buried under a mountain of red tape. Retirees felt the burn of the Obama administration worse than anyone. President Trump just changed all that, ordering the US Treasury to restore the cost of living increases and issue checks to all retirees to cover their losses for the past eight years.\n\nTo be fair to all, Trump issued the order to be retroactive to anyone 65 or older as of today, meaning if you were over 57 years old in 2009 you’ll be receiving a check in the mail, courtesy of your president, for $4,106. That should go a long way towards helping to heal the pain of 8 years of a traitor.\n\nYou won’t need to do anything to qualify for the relief fund other than be a US citizen who files a tax return every year. The measure is expected to cost nearly $40 billion, which will be cut from spending on social services that are far over-funded, such as food stamps and the CHIP program. It’s time we started taking care of those who have contributed the longest and for the younger generation to learn to care for themselves.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-president-trumps-latest-executive-order-will-make-retirees-very-happy/","1488465210.0"

"Trump Signs Law To Lower The Age Of Consensual Sex To 13 Years Of Age\nWashington, D.C. – An announcement was made on Wednesday by the Trump Administration which states a new law that will take effect January 2, 2018 and Americans are shocked and disappointed. According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country.\n\nThe lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision.\n\nIn all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as “third-base” is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.","http://now8news.com/trump-signs-law-lower-age-consensual-sex-13-years-age/","1487800591.0"

"Trump Signs Deal With NBC For New TV Series: “The Real First Family of D.C.”\nAmong the many other things President Donald Trump has been focused on since his election, we now know that one of them was shopping around a reality TV show featuring his family’s eventful new life in Washington, titled, The Real First Family of D.C.\n\nThat news came yesterday when the White House announced that the president had signed a deal with NBC to co-produce and star in the series that will begin airing Memorial Day weekend, according to network sources. The show’s executive producer will be Mark Burnett, who worked with Mr. Trump in the past on The Apprentice, also an NBC program.\n\nAccording to those who’ve seen test footage of the show, one segment features Ivanka, Don Jr., and Eric turning viciously on half-sister, Tiffany. (Credit: ABC News/US Weekly)\n\nThe official statement read: “President Donald J. Trump and the First Family are thrilled to be part of a new production from NBC titled The Real First Family of D.C.\n\nThe President has no doubt that this will be the greatest show in the history of television — much bigger than The Apprentice, The Celebrity Apprentice and Roots combined. This new ‘mega-hit in the making’ fuses the gripping family drama of HBO’s Game of Thrones with the sizzling political intrigue of the Netflix series, House of Cards.”\n\nPresident Trump, clearly excited by the launch of the show, tweeted at 3am: “Wow. Big news! America’s First Family coming to you in prime time starting in September! Must-see TV!”\n\nSeveral production assistants working closely with Mark Burnett, revealed that the first episode will open with television news footage taken at the 2016 Republican convention.\n\nAsked later during a press conference how he planned to work the production demands of a television show into his already packed political schedule, and his constant attacks on the press, Mr. Trump answered: “Look, from the very first moment I announced my candidacy, I was hoping that an election victory would result in a television experience giving every American an incredible peek into the workings of their government. Talk about transparency! I’m going to be the most transparent president ever, and The Real First Family of D.C., from Donald J. Trump Productions, is the proof.”\n\nThe revelation that Mr. Trump has been positioning the reality show for sale to a television network for more than a year may help explain why Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump moved their family from New York to Washington so quickly after the election. Taking prominent positions within the administration from day one guarantees them both plenty of camera time when shooting begins later this month.\n\nSources close to Steve Bannon say he fully expected to be a major cast member of the show and went to war with Jared Kushner when the dimpled son-in-law lobbied the president for more prominent roles for himself and wife Ivanka.\n\nOne NBC television executive, who spoke off the record, added that Melania’s earlier decision to live in New York City was actually a plot device suggested by Mark Burnett to create the appearance of tension between the President and First Lady. Burnett felt strongly that planting the seeds of a potential messy divorce, played out on a national stage, was a proven way to hook viewers in the first season.\n\nMr. Trump also proposed adding a “hot young mistress or a horny White House intern” to the plot line to give it more authenticity. Network sources would not say if a decision has been made on the president’s proposal, but did confirm that Mr. Trump has added a casting couch to the Oval Office.\n\nThe unprecedented news of a reality show taking place within the White House has raised alarm bells in the intelligence community. One longtime FBI special agent, speaking anonymously, noted that President Trump’s well-documented love of television, along with his now confessed desire to turn his presidency into a major media event via reality TV, might shed light on his apparent willingness to collude with the Russians to win the election at any cost — including criminal interference.\n\nIn 2010, businessman Trump was quoted as saying, “Television is the be-all and end-all of my life — I’d rather have a hit TV show than become the President of the United States.” It’s possible that with the launch of The Real First Family of D.C., he has figured out how to do both.\n\n****\n\nThanks to all the many readers, fans, followers, and even my frenemies, for reading and commenting on my posts throughout the year as I continue my commitment to post every day, 7-days-a-week until the Orange Accident is no more.\n\nI read every comment.

"WWE Staff Forced To Shoot Aggressive Wrestler After Child Climbs Into Steel Cage\nINDIANAPOLIS—Saying they were left with no other choice given the imminent peril of the situation, World Wrestling Entertainment officials confirmed they were forced to kill one of their own stars Friday when a 7-year-old boy wandered into the steel cage enclosure of an aggressive wrestler.\n\nBeloved two-time WWE champion Big Show was reportedly shot dead after the emergency response team at the Indiana Farmers Coliseum made a split-second decision to take out the nearly 400-pound dominant male wrestler, who is said to have appeared aggravated and hostile, causing those present to fear for the small child’s safety.\n\n“Last night, after determining he posed a clear threat to a young boy who had entered the steel cage, we chose to end the life of one of our wrestlers,” said WWE spokesperson Chris Bellitti, who added that the security guards who opened fire had followed protocol, assessing the body language and vocalizations of the 45-year-old wrestler to evaluate the danger he presented. “It is a tragedy anytime something like this happens, but luckily we can say a child is alive today thanks to the swift and appropriate measures taken by our WWE staff.”\n\n“While lethal force is always a last resort, the reality is that we were dealing with a very large adult—one of our strongest males,” Bellitti continued. “A tranquilizer could have taken five, even 10, minutes to bring down a wrestler that size, and it likely would have made him even angrier in the meantime. We simply couldn’t risk waiting any longer to act.”\n\nThough a popular attraction for WWE since his arrival in 1999, the 7-foot, 383-pound Big Show reportedly angered easily and had a history of violent outbursts, often acting belligerently toward other wrestlers to intimidate them and, at times, even confronting officials who entered the ring with him. The wrestler is known to have exhibited erratic behavior on numerous occasions, including several altercations in which individuals required medical attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his reputation, WWE representatives insisted the wrestler would never intentionally hurt a child, though they acknowledged he likely interpreted the shouts and flashing cameras of onlookers as a threat, which would have increased the likelihood of a deadly tantrum.\n\nThe boy’s mother, Lynn Marshall, who said she and her family had enjoyed going to see the WWE’s wrestlers for years, held back tears as she recalled seeing her defenseless son face-to-face in the steel cage with a hulking behemoth ten times his size.\n\n“I turned my back for a second, and the next thing I knew my son was down there with that huge wrestler,” she said. “I screamed and ran toward the ring as fast as I could, just shouting and shouting for help. The wrestler was stomping around and pumping his fists, and I was completely terrified of what he might do next.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When it looked like he was getting ready to pick up my boy and slam him on the canvas, I completely lost it,” she added.\n\nIt was at that moment, sources said, that the wrestler was brought down with multiple rifle shots to the head and heart.\n\nSome witnesses blamed Big Show’s death on the boy’s mother, calling her negligent for not keeping a better eye on her child while in such close proximity to dangerous wrestlers. Others reportedly criticized the facility for not having more physical barriers and stronger safety measures to prevent children from coming into contact with a wrestler as powerful and unpredictable as Big Show in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to reports, protests soon began outside the arena where the wrestler was fatally shot. Many argued that WWE was at fault, having fostered violent behavior in Big Show and countless other wrestlers by confining them to cramped steel cages—which rarely exceed an area of 20 square feet—and allowing crowds to gawk at them for hours on end.\n\n“An innocent wrestler has paid the ultimate price for a mistake made by someone else,” said Sam Carter, a 25-year-old protester who objected to what he called WWE’s inhumane activities. “When you look at everything these wrestlers are subjected to, it clearly amounts to cruelty. We must put an end to this immoral practice before another Big Show dies.”\n\nAdded Carter, “It’s pretty sickening when you consider the fact that they have such short lifespans as it is.”","http://www.theonion.com/article/wwe-staff-forced-shoot-aggressive-wrestler-after-c-56272/","None"

"Coca-Cola And Nestlé To Privatize The Largest Reserve Of Water In South America\nBy Amanda Froelich Truth Theory\n\nUpdate: As of March 15, 2018, both Coca-Cola and Nestle have denied allegations that they seek to privatize the Guarani Aquifier in South America. A spokesperson for Coca-Cola’s Brazilian division said in a statement:\n\n“Coca-Cola is not negotiating with any government of any country the exploitation of the Guaraní Aquifer System. The Coca-Cola Company considers water as a precious resource for life and a universal right for the healthy development of ecosystems, communities, agriculture and commerce.”\n\nA statement was also provided by Nestle. The company stated:\n\n“We do not extract water from any part of the Guarani Aquifer in South America, including in Brazil. We have no plans to do so and neither are we discussing this matter with the Brazilian authorities. Suggestions to the contrary are incorrect.\n\nWherever we bottle water, we conduct water resource studies and constantly monitor our withdrawals to ensure we do not negatively affect local watersheds and aquifers. We are fully committed to water stewardship and the human right to water.”\n\nThe initial report, cited by the Brazilian blog, Correido do Brasil, is from 2016 and has since been debunked. Truth Theory apologizes for any inaccuracies which were perpetrated and included this update to ensure readers are informed.\n\nPrivate companies such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé are allegedly in the process of privatizing the largest reserve of water, known as the Guarani Aquifer, in South America. The aquifer is located beneath the surface of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and is the second largest-known aquifer system in the world.\n\nReported by Correiodo Brasil the major transnational conglomerates are “striding forward” with their negotiations to privatize the aquifer system. Meetings have already been reserved with authorities of the current government, such as Michel Temer, to outline procedures required for private companies to exploit the water sources. The concession contracts will last more than 100 years.\n\nThe first public conversation about this dilemma was scheduled on the same day the process of voting for the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff was opened. As Central Politico reports, “This coincidence was fatal for the adjournment of the meeting.”\n\n“There must be another list of projects to be granted or privatized in the medium term, with auctions that may occur in up to one year, such as Eletrobras energy distributors and freshwater sources,” adds the news site, translated via Google from Portuguese.\n\nThis issue extends beyond South America, as all humans will be affected by the decision to privatize the second-largest aquifer system in the world. Essentially, the corporations are profiting off a natural resource that should be freely available to all.\n\nUnder the Guarani Aquifer Project’s Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development Project, known as ANA’s Guarani Aquifer Project (SAG), the aquifer would be managed and preserved for present and future generations. Following the conservatives’ victory in Argentina and the coup d’état, pressed for by the ultra right in Paraguay and Brazil, only Uruguay was left to vote on the privatization of the aquifer.\n\nApproximately two-thirds (1.2 million km²) of the reserve is located in Brazilian territory, specifically in the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Future generations will ultimately suffer if this deal goes through, which is why human rights organizations around the world are getting involved.\n\n“Organized civil society is alert to possible privatization strategies of transnational economic groups. Since 2003, the Organization of American States (OAS) and the World Bank, through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), have implemented the Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development project to gather and develop research on the Guarani Aquifer , with the objective of implementing a common institutional, legal and technical model for MERCOSUR countries,” says a document from the Human Rights Organization Terra de Direitos.\n\nNothing will change if we, as a populace, sit idly by and watch greedy individuals exploit the environment and snatch precious resources from present and future generations.

"82-Year-Old Who Killed A Muslim In Self-Defense Gets The Death Penalty\n82-year-old William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, California, has been sentenced to death for defending himself against a life-threatening situation. In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims.\n\nThe men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.\n\nNow, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds.\n\nProsecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release:\n\n“Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial.\n\nWhile they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull.\n\nHallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.”\n\nReligious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California?\n\nDeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.”\n\nDeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.\n\nSource: Ladies of Liberty","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.thepatriotreport.net/82-year-old-who-killed-a-muslim-in-self-defense-gets-the-death-penalty/","1516020433.0"

This policy applies to “anyone evacuated on U.S.-government coordinated transport, including charter and military flights.”\n\nBut the State policy does not apply to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, a spokeswoman for the department said.\n\nThe Defense Department would be in charge of any evacuated people from Puerto Rico. The Pentagon did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nIn the case of Dominica, some promissory notes were waived due to medical emergencies, the State Department spokesman said.\n\nPeople who sign the promissory notes are effectively taking out a loan from the U.S. government. The loans, according to the State Department's website, are managed 'by the Comptroller and Global Financial Services office in Charleston, South Carolina.'\n\nA note on the State Department's website says that due to 'ongoing emergencies,' it is not accepting repayments on the loans right now.\n\n'Currently, loan repayments cannot be completed due to ongoing emergencies in the region. We will update travel.state.gov/evacuate as soon as repayments can be made,' the State Department says.\n\nLimits are placed on the passports of evacuees who sign the notes, the State Department's website says.\n\n“Upon evacuation, a Department of State official must limit an evacuee’s passport. In order to obtain a new passport, an evacuee must arrange payment as agreed upon via the promissory note,' the website reads.\n\nThe Trump administration has faced criticism from Democrats about the pace of relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico is without power, and many of the territory's 3.4 million inhabitants are without clean drinking water.\n\nTrump has vowed that his administration would receive high marks for Hurricane Maria relief efforts.\n\n“We’ve gotten A-pluses on Texas and in Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico,” Trump said Tuesday. “But the difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. It’s a big ocean, it’s a very big ocean. And we’re doing a really good job.”\n\nTrump on Thursday lifted shipping restrictions on relief efforts to Puerto Rico, allowing non-U.S. owned and crewed ships to deliver aid to the island.\n\n--This report was updated at 2:21 p.m.","http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/352824-trump-administration-forcing-puerto-rico-evacuees-to-pay-for/","1506601416.0"
"Tucker Carlson Couldn't Debate the Anti-Trump Organizer He Wanted, So This Actor Stepped Up\nFox News’ Tucker Carlson had a hard time booking Olga Lexell, the creator and co-organizer of the nationwide Not My President’s Day protests on Monday.\n\nSo, after repeated refusals, Carlson’s show instead booked Shane Saunders, a Los Angeles-based actor and casting agent, who Lexell said “was not affiliated in any way with our rallies and was not an organizer.”\n\nIn the five-minute segment, Saunders was referred to as an “organizer” by an on-screen graphic and Carlson himself, who also asked Saunders about why “your protest is going to make a difference.”\n\n“It's frustrating because, with the exception of one person, all of the organizers are women,” Lexell told The Daily Beast. “For a man who knows nothing about the protests to go on TV unprepared, misrepresent our message, take credit for our weeks of hard work, and make us look bad—and for Tucker Carlson's team to go along with it—is just disappointing.”\n\nLexell said Carlson’s producers reached out to “all of the nationwide organizers on Facebook and proceeded to Facebook message us” on Monday, asking them to be on the show. She initially said yes, “just to bide (our) time while I contacted everyone.”\n\n“Once everyone was on the same page, I canceled (and) made some jokes about how I'd meet Tucker for brunch,” she said. “He responded by begging me to come on the show.”\n\nEmails Lexell posted on Twitter and provided to The Daily Beast show Carlson sending two personal requests for Lexell to appear on his show, which she declined.\n\nCarlson has been accused of “blindsiding his guests and keeping them from issuing fully formed answers” by reporters like the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple, who wrote just that after appearing on Fox News in primetime last week. This led to other writers, like Alex Pareene at Deadspin, to implore potential Carlson guests to learn from Wemple’s appearance and “ Don't Volunteer To Be Ambushed On Television .”\n\nSaunders, who Lexell said saw her “post the jokes about not wanting to go on Tucker's show and replied with a bunch of comments he's since deleted,” was then booked in her stead.\n\n“I told him that we had just organized a massive rally with ample news coverage and that we didn't need to go on Tucker Carlson's show to validate that,” she said.\n\nShe insists Saunders, who she says is “a friend of some friends of mine,” had nothing to do with organizing the protests.\n\n“He was not involved in the planning of the protests in any way, at any point, ever,” she said. “Heather (Mason) and I organized the LA event that started the whole thing, and we had specific contacts in the other cities who had dealt with media outreach before. We know everyone who was involved on every team.”\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox! Daily Digest Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.

I don't know what in the world would make him think that was a good idea or even one that made logical sense,' said Mason. 'He didn't clarify his role in the protests and proceeded to lock his Twitter account after I asked him if he attended.'\n\nSaunders told The Daily Beast he went on the show “under the conditions that I wouldn’t allow my words to be twisted by Tucker Carlson.”\n\n'They said it would be a very simple segment about you as a protestor at today’s rally,' said Saunders, who said 'works on the other side of (acting) now' in a writers room. 'I never once said I was an organizer of the event.'\n\nSaunders said that Lexell, whom he says he's never met in person, has been 'thrown off on this wild course of craziness right now' since the interview 'blew up in a way that I never would’ve imagined.'\n\nAfter Saunders appeared on the show, Lexell emailed the show’s producers to let them know of the extent of his involvement in the protests, which totaled about 13,000 people in New York alone.\n\n“Hey just so you guys know, that guy who you got on the show isn't affiliated with our event and didn't even attend any of the protests. I know him in real life and he's an aspiring actor,” she said. (Saunders said he attended the event and is now working in a writer's room.)\n\n“Okay,” one of Carlson’s producers responded.\n\nUpdate: Fox News' Justin Wells, Executive Producer of Tucker Carlson Tonight, has issued a statement to The Daily Beast regarding the segment.\n\n'The program incorrectly identified a Los Angeles based protest participant as a ‘protest organizer’ in a graphic during Monday night’s telecast. While he was correctly identified in the introduction to the segment, we regret the graphic didn’t accurately reflect his role throughout the entire segment.'\n\nThe story was also updated to include comment from Saunders.","http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/21/tucker-carlson-couldn-t-debate-the-anti-trump-organizer-he-wanted-so-this-actor-stepped-up.html/","1487653200.0"

According to two different White House general staffers and a mid-level aide in the West Wing, Trey Gowdy sat with both President Trump and Vice-President Pence for several hours today to discuss the “future of the 2020 ticket.”\n\nRumors have been swirling around the Executive Mansion for weeks that Mike Pence may feel like he could be more beneficial delivering the state of Indiana and running for Senate to fill the seat of Kelly MaCadoo, who has decided to join the ranks of the RINO and retire in 2020. Pence is the best option to keep that seat and it still put him in a good position to run in 2024.\n\nThat leaves the second most powerful seat in the world open to someone who will be able to do great things, and it appears that someone is Trey Gowdy.

"Donald Trump replaces George Washington painting in Oval Office with Vigo the Carpathian\n4.3 (86.67%) 36 votes\n\nRedecoration of the Oval Office is a tradition. Some presidents change the order of the artwork, the furniture, the paint, the wallpaper. Some even replace everything. From the pastel blue of the Carter years to that same rug used by Reagan, George W. Bush, and Obama, things in the office either change or don’t based on the whim of the man in the chair. Trump has decorated the office with familiar Trump style, replacing the maroon curtains with gold ones. Several art objects have been eliminated or added.\n\nReports that the bust of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was removed proved to be more CNN blustering based on an incomplete picture. That doesn’t mean that big changes were not made in art. The most notable change is the addition of a mantle-to-ceiling portrait of Vigo the Carpathian in place of a portrait of George Washington over the fireplace. Who is Vigo the Carpathian, you ask?\n\nVigo the Carpathian (originally known as Vigo Von Homburg Deutschendorf) is an ancient 16th Century medieval tyrant and sorcerer, who later died in the 17th century. He was a despotic ruler who didn’t do his subjects any favors. He was also known as the “Scourge of Carpathia,” the “Sorrow of Moldavia” and a host of other unflattering names like “Vigo the Cruel,” “Vigo the Torturer,” “Vigo the Despised,” and “Vigo the Unholy.” He died at the ripe old age of 105 but not of old age. He was lynched by his subjects because of his role in the better part of a century’s maltreatment.\n\nAsked about the painting, the Trump camp simply stated that it brought the leader of the free world a ‘measure of calm.’ We must admit that it is a rather striking and imposing painting but if it helps him work, so be it. One member of the White House press corps mentioned seeing the President talking to the painting, but presidential spokespeople dismissed that as fanciful nonsense.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://immediatesafety.org/donald-trump-replaces-george-washington-painting-in-oval-office-with-vigo-the-carpathian/","None"
"NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”\nHOUSTON — It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.\n\n“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”\n\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\n\n“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”\n\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”\n\nIt’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.\n\nREMINDER: THIS STORY IS SATIRE, FOLKS.

"Mike Pence: “Allowing Rape Victims To Have Abortions Will Lead To Women Trying To Get Raped”\nThe Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.\n\nAsked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.\n\n“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”\n\nPence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”\n\nDonald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”\n\n“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.","http://politicot.com/mike-pence-allowing-rape-victims-abortions-will-lead-women-trying-get-raped/","1468778303.0"
"Supreme Court Reversal Gives Trump A HUGE Win Over Illegals!\nThe Supreme Court this morning ruled that illegal aliens have no right to sue anybody if they feel they’ve been mistreated. In a 5-4 decision, the conservative-leaning court reminded America that illegal aliens are called illegal for a reason and therefore don’t have the same rights as American citizens.\n\nThat means if they’re arrested for being here illegally they have the right to an attorney…in their own country. They have the right to a speedy trial…in Mexico. They have the right to remain silent and not incriminate themselves…just not here.\n\nHere they have the right to be loaded onto buses and sent back to where they belong to apply for legal citizenship like everyone else. That also means that sanctuary cities have no right to tell federal agencies that they can’t come in and collect illegals for deportation.\n\nIt’s time the liberal snowflakes figured this out once and for all: In Trump’s America, we will take care of our own.

"President Trump Orders the Execution of Five Turkeys Pardoned by Obama\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – In another sweeping move aimed at undoing the perceived damage done by the Obama administration, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office.\n\n“After reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration, President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. “This morning, the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed.”\n\nSpicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. “There are a lot of obvious questions we just don’t have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We can’t be sure,” he said. “All we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process.”\n\nOf the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama, all but five are deceased. “These birds, despite their deaths, will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden,” Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds – Tater, Tot, Abe, Honest, and Cheese – are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad.\n\nThe annual Thanksgiving Day turkey pardon dates back to 1863 when President Abraham Lincoln first granted clemency to his son’s beloved pet turkey which the First Family had intended to feast on for Thanksgiving dinner.","http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/01/president-trump-orders-execution-five-turkeys-pardoned-obama/","1485271249.0"

"All Homeopathic Products Now Illegal?\nBy Dr. Mercola\n\nAbout 5 million U.S. adults and 1 million U.S. children use homeopathy every year, and the remedies are known to be “generally safe and unlikely to cause severe adverse reactions,” according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.1 Yet, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues on its latest crusade, this natural health modality may soon be much harder to come by.\n\nIn a draft guidance document released in December 2017, the FDA takes aim at homeopathic remedies, or as they put it, “drug products labeled as homeopathic.”2,3 In a reversal of a long-standing decision to treat homeopathic remedies differently from other drugs, the FDA has now labeled virtually all of these products as “new drugs” that are “subject to FDA enforcement action at any time.”\n\nFDA Declares Homeopathic Drugs Illegal, Plans to Ramp up Enforcement Actions\n\nWhile deaths from drugs like opioids are now a public health crisis, homeopathy has maintained a much lower, and presumably safer, profile. Yet, the FDA is using its limited resources to target the latter, citing a need to “protect consumers who choose to use homeopathic products.” Why now? The FDA also cited a “large uptick in products labeled as homeopathic that are being marketed for a wide array of diseases and conditions,” to the extent that homeopathic products are now a close to $3 billion industry.4\n\nPerhaps that’s $3 billion too much for Big Pharma, FDA’s cozy partner in crime. “[I]n one fell swoop, the FDA has declared that virtually every single homeopathic drug on the market is being sold illegally,” the Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH USA) wrote5 — and it’s not an exaggeration. In essence, the FDA’s guidance reads:6\n\nAny homeopathic drug that has not been considered “generally recognized as safe and effective” (GRAS/E) is considered a new drug FDA has not determined that any homeopathic drugs are GRAS/E A new drug cannot be marketed unless it goes through the FDA’s approval process No homeopathic drugs have gone through FDA approval nor can any producer afford to take them through the approval process\n\nThe FDA then states that it’s proposing a “new, risk-based enforcement approach” and first plans to target the “unapproved drug products labeled as homeopathic that have the greatest potential to cause risk to patients.” This includes:7\n\nProducts with reported safety concerns Products that contain or claim to contain ingredients associated with potentially significant safety concerns Products for routes of administration other than oral and topical Products intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of serious and/or life-threatening diseases and conditions Products for vulnerable populations Products that do not meet standards of quality, strength or purity as required under the law\n\nFDA Does About-Face, ‘Penalizes an Entire Industry’\n\nThe draft guidance is a complete turnaround from the FDA’s prior stance on homeopathic remedies, which stated, under the 1988 Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 400.400, Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed, they did not need to get FDA approval prior to coming on the market. Instead, the ingredients in homeopathic remedies were to be verified by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS). As noted by law firm Venable:8\n\n“Essentially, the HPUS creates a monograph for homeopathic drugs to follow, not dissimilar to the OTC drug monographs that FDA has developed for allopathic drugs. Accordingly, by virtue of an ingredient’s inclusion in the HPUS, the ingredient has already been closely examined and determined to be safe and effective by the HPCUS [Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States].\n\nCompliance with the HPUS functions as a premarket review of safety and effectiveness in the homeopathic context. By classifying homeopathic drugs as unapproved new drugs, the FDA is requiring a second showing of safety and effectiveness, a step that is unnecessary, not to mention impractical, given that the Agency intends to hold homeopathic products to an allopathic standard that is inappropriate, given the nature of homeopathic products.”\n\nFurther, it was by the FDA’s own deliberate decision that homeopathic drugs were excluded from former drug approval processes and intended to be a separate category. Venable continued:9\n\n“The FDA deliberately excluded homeopathic drugs from both the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) review (the process by which all drugs approved between 1938 and 1962 were retrospectively evaluated by the FDA for effectiveness) and the OTC Drug Review in 1972 (the process used to develop OTC drug monographs for allopathic drugs), deciding instead in the latter case to regulate homeopathic products separately because of their uniqueness.\n\nBy withdrawing the CPG and classifying all homeopathic drugs as unapproved drugs subject to FDA drug approval, the FDA is now requiring higher regulatory thresholds for OTC homeopathic drugs than are applicable to allopathic OTC drugs, many of which are permitted to be sold pursuant to the FDA monograph system. This move in effect penalizes an entire industry for the Agency’s 1972 decision.”\n\nFTC Targeted Homeopathy in 2016\n\nThe FDA isn’t the first government agency to target this centuries’ old natural medicine system. In a notice filed in November 2016, the FTC stated that in order for homeopathic remedies to claim they are effective, their makers must provide proof. If no proof is provided, the remedies must state there is “no scientific evidence that the product works.”\n\nIn order to not mislead consumers, the FTC further stated that homeopathic remedies lacking sufficient proof must communicate to consumers that “the product’s claims are based only on theories of homeopathy from the 1700s that are not accepted by most modern medical experts.”10 Dana Ullman, MPH, CCH, one of the leading advocates for homeopathy in the U.S., said at the time:11\n\n“Considering the longtime safety history of homeopathic medicines, it is surprising and even shocking that the FTC would consider proposing new regulations now.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder who or what is pulling their strings … policies … commonly result from powerful economic forces at play … it is clear that this governmental agency is ignoring important scientific evidence, and one must wonder if they are protecting Big Pharma from competition more than protecting the consumer.”\n\nDoes Homeopathy Work?\n\nBased on the theory that “like cures like,” or the Law of Similars, homeopathy was founded by German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann. The idea is that health conditions can be healed by treating a person with minute doses of a substance that would produce similar symptoms to their health condition if given in larger doses.\n\nHomeopathy’s other guiding principle is that of the minimum dose, which is based on the premise that the more a substance is diluted, the more potent homeopathic remedy it becomes, known as the “law of infinitesimals.” Homeopathic remedies may be made from plants, minerals or other substances and are commonly administered in pellet form, dissolved under the tongue. A number of intriguing studies suggest homeopathy is effective and safe for a variety of ailments, including flu. According to Ullman:\n\n“The use of a homeopathic medicine called Oscillococcinum is an example of a remedy that can be effective for many people with the flu, though clinical experience suggests that it is most effective when used within 48 hours of getting flu symptoms. Although most homeopathic medicines are made from the plant or mineral kingdom, Oscillococcinum is unusual in that it is made from the heart and liver of a duck.”\n\nIn one study, nearly twice as many patients who were given Oscillococcinum recovered from the flu within 48 hours as those given a placebo.12 Further, Ullman noted:\n\n“A different group of researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind study involving 372 patients (188 treated with Oscillococcinum and 187 with placebo) of both sexes, ranging in age from 12 to 60, who presented rectal temperature ≥ 100.4 F, muscle pains, headache, or at least one of the following symptoms: shivering, chest pain, spine pain, coughing, irritation of nasal mucosa or feeling of malaise.13\n\nPatients received three tubes of Oscillococcinum or placebo each day (morning, noon and night) for three days. The results of this trial show a highly statistically significant difference between the two groups, for what concerns disappearance of symptoms after 48 hours (19.2 percent in the Oscillococcinum group versus 17.1 percent in the placebo group) and improvement in symptoms (43.7 percent versus 38.6 percent for placebo).”\n\nAdditional research shows homeopathy’s promising role in the following conditions:\n\nIn patients with allergies, those using homeopathy reported improvements in nasal airflow compared with a placebo group. With homeopathic treatment, the researchers described a “clear, significant and clinically relevant improvement in nasal inspiratory peak flow, similar to that found with topical steroids.”14 Homeopathy significantly reduced the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis (swelling and sores in the mouth) in children.15 Homeopathic medicine was effective in treating acute childhood diarrhea, decreasing both the duration of the diarrhea and the number of stools per day.16,17 Homeopathy has positive effects in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly in the areas of behavioral and cognitive functions.18 Homeopathy lessened tender point pain and improved quality of life in people with fibromyalgia.19 Homeopathic was effective in treating the early stages of vitiligo in a report of 14 cases20\n\nFDA Continues to Crack Down on Natural Substances, Protect Big Pharma\n\nThe FDA’s new push to regulate homeopathic products is eerily reminiscent of their recent crackdown on the plant kratom. Leaves from the kratom tree have been used for pain relief for hundreds of years, but scientists now know they contain compounds that target the brain similarly to opioids, helping to relieve pain. It appears the plant may be safer than opioids for pain relief and could even act as a tool to help those suffering from opioid withdrawal.\n\nIn November 2017, however, rather than targeting the prescription opioids that are the root of the opioid epidemic, the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding risks associated with kratom use, suggesting that its usage could “expand the opioid epidemic.” What this comes down to, for some, is the right to choose what form of “medicine” to put in your body. As Dr. Lee Hieb, an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, wrote in WND:21\n\n“I’m not here to tout any particular over-the-counter remedy, but who gave the FDA total ability to limit what we can take into our bodies, while virtually forcing us to be given what they prescribe? It’s none of their business whether a ‘homeopathic remedy’ is worthless.\n\nThat’s an issue of commerce and truth in advertising. I, for one, want the freedom to research and decide for myself what supplements to take, even if my supplements ultimately do me no good. (Many do a great deal of good as Big Pharma knows only too well.)”\n\nPeople have the right to choose their treatment, and doctors (many of whom admit to prescribing placebos to their patients) also retain the right to offer treatments they deem useful, whether it be homeopathy or another remedy.\n\nAs for the FDA’s new draft guidance on homeopathic drugs, it’s attempting to discredit such remedies’ proven healing powers before their mechanisms of action have even been fully understood. If you want to express your opinion on the matter, the FDA is accepting comments from the public until March 30, 2018.","https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/01/30/homeopathic-products-now-illegal.aspx?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=facebookmercola_nonlead2&amp;utm_campaign=20180130_homeopathic-products-now-illegal/","1517288400.0"

"Estados Unidos devolvería a Puerto Rico a España\nNota de archivo: Este contenido fue publicado hace más de 90 días\n\n119 años después del Tratado de París, que viabilizó el traspaso del dominio sobre Puerto Rico de España a Estados Unidos, Madrid y Washington prácticamente han finiquitado un acuerdo para devolver la jurisdicción de la isla caribeña al país europeo, confirmaron a endi.com fuentes de los tres países.\n\nEl trato, que lleva negociándose en secreto al menos dos años, no es oficial todavía, pero tiene el visto bueno ya de los presidentes Donald Trump, de Estados Unidos, y Mariano Rajoy, de España, y solo falta finiquitar ciertos detalles técnicos para hacer el anuncio.\n\nSe esperaba un anuncio antes de fin de año, pero es posible que el surgimiento de complicaciones de última hora retrase la aprobación del traspaso hasta los primeros días de 2018. El acuerdo tiene que ser aprobado por el Congreso de Estados Unidos, que estuvo ocupado hasta las últimas horas de su última sesión en la reforma contributiva federal y no tuvo tiempo para atender este tema.\n\nSe informó que el acuerdo goza de un apoyo abrumador en el Congreso. “Hace tiempo que esto debió hacerse. Es más, Estados Unidos nunca debió tomar posesión de Puerto Rico. Fue un error. Puerto Rico nos ha costado demasiado”, dijo el senador republicano de Alabama Luke McCullen.\n\nDebido a la inminencia del acuerdo es que Washington no ha aprobado los fondos para la reconstrucción de Puerto Rico tras el huracán María ni para mantener a flote el plan de salud del gobierno. Esperan que España responda por esas cuentas.\n\nSegún fuentes, las conversaciones comenzaron en el 2015 tras una broma que el ministro de Finanzas de Alemania, Wolfgang -Schaueble, le hizo al entonces secretario del Tesoro de Estados Unidos, Jacob Lew, diciéndole que la Unión Europea aceptaría a Puerto Rico como miembro si Estados Unidos se hacía cargo de Grecia. Lew, según fuentes, quiso jugarle la broma al ministro de Finanzas de España, Jesús Galindo, quien no se percató de que era una broma y al día siguiente se acercó a funcionarios estadounidenses con una propuesta ya formal y autorizada por el gobierno de Rajoy y por la Corona española.\n\n“Lew leyó la propuesta divertido, pero a medida en que leía se daba cuenta de que tenía mucho sentido. Así empezó esto”, dijo una fuente de Casa Blanca. Lew le habló del tema al entonces presidente Barack Obama en los mismos días en que Alejandro García Padilla anunciaba que Puerto Rico no tenía cómo pagar su deuda. “Go ahead”, le dijo Obama, según fuentes.\n\nNo es la primera vez que se traspasa una colonia de una jurisdicción a otra. Hong Kong pasó de dominio británico a chino en 1999.\n\nLas tres fuerzas políticas de Puerto Rico no han sido consultadas ni han tenido participación alguna en las conversaciones. Pero como un gesto de buena voluntad se les adelantó el anuncio que será hecho en los próximos días y, en términos generales, no tienen mayores objeciones, confirmaron fuentes estadistas, estadolibristas e independentistas\n\n“Dado el estado de las cosas en este momento histórico en Madrid, en Washington y en San Juan, este es un paso lógico y beneficioso para todas las partes. Washington sale de un problema que hace tiempo es claro que no sabe cómo manejar, España recibe un posesión momentos en que cada vez parece más claro que perderá a Cataluña y Puerto Rico queda bajo el cuidado de un país con su mismo idioma y tradiciones”, dijo Venancio Montes, embajador de España en Washington.\n\nCletus Ryder, embajador de Estados Unidos en España, agregó, por su parte: “luego de 119 años bajo jurisdicción de Estados Unidos, está claro que Puerto Rico no se va a asimilar y que sigue hablando español y manteniendo sus tradiciones hispanas. Nuestra relación estaba en un callejón sin salida. Esto es beneficioso para todos”.\n\nComo parte del acuerdo, Estados Unidos se encargará de la mitad de la deuda de $120,000 millones de Puerto Rico. De los restantes de $ 60,000 millones, la Unión Europea se encargará del 50%. Puerto Rico quedará con unos $30,000 millones en deudas. La Unión Europea, mientras tanto, asignará 50,000 euros para continuar con las labores de reconstrucción tras el paso del huracán María.\n\nEspaña dará a Puerto Rico el régimen autonómico del que gozó a isla por poco tiempo desde el 1897 hasta la invasión estadounidense y el acuerdo establece que asignará a la isla fondos en una proporción similar a los que ahora asigna Estados Unidos.\n\nUna vez el traspaso sea aprobado, se iniciará un proceso de transición que no debe durar más de seis meses, por lo que se espera que la bandera estadounidense sea bajada de las instalaciones federales en Puerto Rico a más tardar en el verano de 2018. En ese momento, la comisionada residente de Puerto Rico en Washington, Jenniffer González, deberá mudarse a Madrid y comenzar a ejercer como delegada de Puerto Rico en el Parlamento español.\n\nSobre el siempre complicado tema de la ciudadanía estadounidense, el acuerdo establece que los puertorriqueños que ahora la tienen la mantendrán hasta que mueran, pero sus hijos nacerán ciudadanos españoles. España también se compromete a autorizar mudanzas de puertorriqueños residentes en Estados Unidos a ese país sin restricciones. Los que se decidan quedarse en Estados Unidos podrán hacerlo.\n\nFuentes del Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP) dijeron que desde su punto de vista no tienen objeciones al cambio si se garantiza asistencia económica al mismo nivel del que ahora provee Estados Unidos. Entre los populares tampoco hay problemas siempre que el control sobre los asuntos de Puerto Rico se ejerza desde afuera. Los independentistas dijeron que ellos seguirán luchando por la independencia igual contra España que contra Estados Unidos.\n\n“Pensamos que iba a ser más difícil manejar la reacción de los partidos políticos de Puerto Rico. Pero no. Lo han asumido con bastante resignación. Los puertorriqueños siempre han sido muy pragmáticos con esto de quién manda en su tierra”, dijo el embajador Montes.\n\nEl gobernador Ricardo Rosselló ha citado para una conferencia de prensa sobre este tema a las 3:00 de la tarde de hoy, 28 de diciembre.","https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/eeuu/nota/estadosunidosdevolveriaapuertoricoaespana-2385581/","1514433600.0"

"Sex Pistols Were Financed by USSR to ‘Destabilize Western World’, Admits Ex-KGB Agent\nAlexandrei Varennikovic Voloshin, a retired KGB agent, has admitted this week on National Russian Television (NTV) that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR) was behind the creation of the 1970s punk scene and financed major punk bands such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Ramones.\n\nThe USSR government at the time spent “hundreds of millions of rubles” on this covert operation destined to “create utter chaos” and “pervert the Western youth to nihilist, anti-establishment and anti-American ideologies” he explained in an hour-long interview broadcast on national television.\n\nFamous punk songs of the legendary punk band the Sex pistols were even scripted by a team of psychologists and war propagandists of the USSR.\n\n“I am an anarchist”, “God save the Queen the fascist regime”, “No future” and other nihilist and anti-establishment lyrics were intended to unleash a wave of cynicism towards authorities, promote the use of heavy drugs and entice the youth with revolutionary, counter-establishment ideas.\n\nThe retired KGB agent claims the maneuver was extremely successful.\n\n“We understood at the time that music was a powerful means of propaganda to reach the youth” explained the 77-year old man.\n\n“Our mission was to use teenage angst to our advantage and turn the baby boomer generation of the West into a decadent, pro-drug and anti-establishment culture that would create uprisings and bring Western democracies into utter chaos.\n\nWe even infiltrated mainstream radios to promote their music and reach millions of people every day” he admitted, visibly proud of the accomplishment.\n\n“For many of us in the KGB, infiltrating the 1970s punk scene was one of the USSR’s most successful experiments of propaganda to date” he acknowledged during the interview.\n\nSome experts openly admit Punk nihilism, which was expressed in the use of harder, more self-destructive drugs like heroin and methamphetamine, pushed United States President Richard Nixon into the War on Drugs, a campaign of prohibition of drugs, military aid, and military intervention, with the stated aim being to define and reduce the illegal drug trade within America and around the world.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/sex-pistols-were-financed-by-ussr-to-destabilize-western-world-admits-ex-kgb-agent/","1430406252.0"
"BREAKING: Trump Just Ended Welfare For One HUGE Group For 5 Years! – Let The Riots ERUPT!\n320 SHARES Share Tweet\n\nPresident Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to journalist Chris Menahan.“They said back in July only 55 out of one million migrants had got jobs with any major firms and 50 of those jobs were working at the post office,” he reported. “Two-thirds or more of these migrants are illiterate in their own languages.”“They came because Merkel promised them free money if they can just make it into the country.”What in tarnation would be a good reason for any country to accept illiterate people who don’t work? There is literally no benefit to the host country to admit people like that. I know it sounds mean to say this, but they don’t offer anything to the country other than leeching the system of funds and it’s a complete downgrade to the population. If you let too many low illiterate people into the country, then they have kids who could be illiterate, then over time, it would only decrease the overall intelligence of the country and civilization in America would suffer. We need hard working and intelligent people who bring promise and productivity to further the advancement of Americans and mankind. That sounds like quite a stretch but think of the impact of accepting one million people who mostly can’t read or don’t work.Now the government has to pay for them.Let’s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. That’s $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all. That is literally a $0.00 return on investment. Not that people are a business, but that’s really bad business. And as you can see, Germany has turned into a cesspool from all the migrants flooding the gates and ruining their nation.Prepare for a massive backlash from liberals, democrats, and activists. There’s sure to be protests regarding Trump’s potential immigration policy.FOLLOW us on Facebook at Freedom Daily!","http://www.americatb.com/2018/03/29/breaking-trump-just-ended-welfare-for-one-huge-group-for-5-years-let-the-riots-erupt/","1522296000.0"

The Lincoln family gets a cut every time the Gettysburg Address is re-published and the Kennedy family still owns the phrase “Ich bin ein Berliner” as well as “I am a jelly donut.’ Teddy’s last senate campaign was run strictly on proceeds from “ask not what your country can do for you.’ Why should this president be any different?

"The Hidden Hazards Of Microwave Cooking\nBy Dr. Mercola\n\nBy now, you probably know that what you eat has a profound impact on your health. The mantra, 'You are what you eat' is really true. But you need to consider not only what you buy, but also how you cook it. When it comes to microwave ovens, the price for convenience is to compromise your health.\n\nIn this article, I will review what we know about the effects microwaves have on your food and on your health. Hopefully I will convince you to get rid of your microwave as even when you are using it to sterilize kitchen sponges, it contaminates your environment with biologically damaging radiation.\n\nSad State of Our Soils\n\nOver the past century, the quality of fresh food has declined due to soil depletion, unsustainable industrial farming practices, overproduction of crops and the use of artificial fertilizers and toxic pesticides and herbicides such as glyphosate, which acts as a mineral chelator. You can no longer assume you're getting all of the vitamins, minerals, enzymes and phytonutrients you need by eating a multitude of fresh produce, even if you're eating organic foods.\n\nNot surprisingly, the amount of nutrition in a calorie of food has been reduced over the past 50 years. Three recent studies of historical food composition have shown 5 to 40 percent declines in some of the minerals in fresh produce, and another study found a similar decline in our protein sources.1\n\nSo, now more than ever, you must be careful to maximize the 'bang for your buck' when it comes to the foods you eat. Research shows your microwave oven will not help you in these efforts. Instead, it will in fact threaten your health by violently ripping the molecules in your food apart, rendering some nutrients inert at best, and carcinogenic at its worst.\n\nConvenience Poses Toxic Threat in More Ways Than One\n\nMicrowaves heat food by causing water molecules to vibrate 2.5 billion times per second, eventually turning to steam that heats your food. While your microwave can rapidly heat a dish, it also alters the food's chemical structure. Structures of the water molecules are torn apart and forcefully deformed. This is different than conventional heating of food, whereby heat is transferred convectionally from the outside inward.\n\nContrary to popular belief, microwaved foods don't actually cook from the inside out. Microwave cooking begins within the molecules where water is present. Since not all areas contain the same amount of water, the heating is uneven. When thicker foods are cooked, microwaves heat the outer layers, and the inner layers are cooked mostly by the conduction of heat from the hot outer layers, inward.\n\nOur knowledge of the danger has radically increased since microwave ovens were first introduced to consumers more than 40 years ago. Besides depleting your food's nutritional value, which will be addressed later in this article, microwave ovens can produce carcinogenic toxins in more ways than one.\n\nWhen plastic is heated, toxic chemicals like BPA and phthalates can leach out of the containers or covers, contaminating your food with endocrine and hormone disruptors. A paper published in 1990 reported the leakage of many toxic chemicals from the packaging of common microwavable foods, including pizzas, chips and popcorn. Chemicals included polyethylene terpthalate (PET), and well-documented carcinogens like dioxin, benzene, toluene and xylene.\n\nIn addition to that, heterocyclic amines (HCAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), known as glycotoxins, also form whenever food is cooked at high heat. All three of these are known carcinogens. These compounds are not present in raw food; more than 90 percent of our exposure to these carcinogens comes from cooked food, including microwaved foods.2\n\nHow Microwaves Damage Your Health\n\nYou might not be aware of this, but microwave ovens operate on gigahertz frequencies very similar to most 4G cellular networks. So, the danger AND the justifications why are identical. Conventional science and industry are clinging to the concept that these microwaves from your cell phones, portable phones, Wi-Fi routers, smart meters and wireless computers and tablets are not harmful because they do not cause any thermal damage.\n\nNew research3,4,5,6 from Professor Emeritus Martin Pall, Ph.D., has provided us with the mechanism of how this low level nonthermal microwave exposure causes biological harm. It has to do with voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs) that are embedded in the cell membranes. He determined this by evaluating over two dozen studies showing you can radically reduce biological microwave damage using calcium channel blockers.\n\nThis explains why the argument that the microwave radiation is not high enough to cause thermal damage is fatally flawed. The statement is partially correct, as the radiation does not cause thermal damage. However, it causes massive biological damage. Pall has compiled a list of 123 studies and papers documenting the various non-thermal health effects of EMFs for those who want to take a deep-dive into the research. The safety standards that have been established are off by a factor of over 7 million.\n\nSo just how does it cause damage? Well, once the VGCCs are activated by microwaves, about 1 million calcium ions per second, these ions then stimulate the release of nitric oxide, which combines with superoxide to form peroxynitrate. These peroxynitrates then create hydroxyl free radicals, the most destructive free radicals known to man, which decimate mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, membranes and proteins that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, the core of most chronic disease.\n\nPall has calculated that these VGCCs are over 7 million times more sensitive to microwave radiation than the charged particles inside and outside the cell, which means the currently established safety standards are off by a factor of over 7 MILLION.\n\nInterestingly, the tissues with the highest density of VGCCs are the brain and nerve tissue like the pacemaker in the heart, and also in the testes. This could explain why we are having an exponential increase in many diseases like autism, Alzheimer's, arrhythmias, anxiety, depression and male infertility. Indeed, in a 2016 paper, Pall documents how microwave EMFs produce 'widespread neuropsychiatric effects including depression.'7\n\nMicrowave radiation does not have enough energy to directly break covalent bonds and damage your DNA in the way that ionizing radiation from X- or gamma rays do. However, it can actually cause more DNA damage than ionizing radiation as a byproduct of the increased hydroxyl free radical production.\n\nFailure to realize this and take steps to minimize exposure not only will damage your DNA and increase your risk of most chronic illness, but also seriously impair your body's ability to remove toxins, and significantly impair your immune response to address the large variety of pathogenic infectious assaults you regularly encounter, especially parasites.\n\nIt is important to understand that using your microwave oven will expose you to an energy density of milliwatts per square centimeter (the standard energy unit measurement in the U.S.). While that sounds like a small number that will not cause thermal damage, it is easily thousands if not millions of times higher than the energy density shown to cause biological damage in hundreds of studies, as biological damage typically shows up in the micro to picowatt range.\n\nSo, every time you turn on your microwave oven, you are exposing yourself to microwave radiation densities thousands of times higher than your cellphone. This is the primary reason why I strongly advise removing the microwave from your home. Next, I will review some of the evidence showing how microwaves damage your food. But remember, this is a relatively minor issue compared to the DIRECT biological damage it will cause you and your family every time you turn it on. The closer you are to the oven, the higher the energy density and the worse the damage will be.\n\nMicrowaving Produces Toxins in Nearly All Types of Food\n\nAs noted in the book, 'Electromagnetic Health: Making Sense of the Research and Practical Solutions for Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) and Radio Frequencies (RF),' written by a naturopath, Case Adams:8\n\n'Research … at the University of California Lawrence Livermore Laboratory concluded that microwaves produced heterocyclic aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Both are suspected carcinogens. Frying meats also produces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons …'\n\nWhile HCAs and PAHs are formed in protein, and AGEs form in protein and carbohydrate foods, Lita Lee, Ph.D., cites research from the Atlantis Rising Educational Center in Oregon in her 1989 book, 'Microwaves and Microwave Ovens,' which showed carcinogens form in nearly all types of food during microwaving.9\n\nAside from HCAs and PAHs, microwaving meat also produces the carcinogen d-nitrosodiethanolamine. When microwaving milk and grains, the amino acids are converted into carcinogenic compounds. Even thawing frozen fruit in your microwave will cause glucosides and galactosides in the fruit to convert into carcinogenic compounds. Ditto for plant foods, in which alkaloids are converted into carcinogens and hazardous free radicals. It doesn't even end there. As cited in 'Electromagnetic Health':\n\n• A 1989 study published in the Lancet found microwaving infant formula converted trans-amino acids into cis-isomers, which are classified as neurotoxins and nephrotoxins, meaning they're toxic to your nerves and kidneys respectively.10 • In a 1991 paper, Swiss food scientist Dr. Hans Ulrich Hertel reported that microwaved food produced carcinogenic effects in the bloodstream.11 It was a small study, consisting of only eight volunteers who drank either raw milk, cooked milk, pasteurized milk or microwave-cooked milk, and organic raw vegetables, cooked conventionally-grown vegetables, organic or conventional frozen vegetables that were then warmed in the microwave, or organic or conventional veggies fully cooked in the microwave. Before and after each meal, blood tests were taken. Those who ate either microwaved milk or vegetables had decreased hemoglobin levels, increased cholesterol levels, decreased white and red blood cells, and decreased lymphocyte levels, the latter of which suggests increased infection or tissue damage. While there are shortcomings and limitations to this study, the results offer food for thought. Hertel also found that when food molecules are deformed by microwaving, radiolytic compounds are formed. Subsequent research suggests these too appear to have carcinogenic potential.12 Not surprisingly, Hertel's study was met with great resistance from those with much to lose. The Swiss electrical appliance establishment lobbied to shut Hertel down, and he was eventually tried and found guilty of 'interfering with commerce.' American journalist Tom Valentine visited Hertel in Germany in 1992, penning a now classic article on his research13\n\nThe study was not without its shortcomings. It involved only eight participants, of which Hertel was one. As compelling as his findings were, his methodology did not stand up to the scientific rigors of the field. But in spite of Hertel's methodological shortcomings, his findings do raise concerns about what this form of radiation is doing to your food and should be taken as a launching point to larger, more robust studies in the future.\n\nHertel wrote: 'There are no atoms, molecules, or cells of any organic system able to withstand such a violent, destructive power for any period of time. This will happen even given the microwave oven's low power range of milliwatts.'\n\nDo Microwaves Leak Radiation?\n\nEarly microwave models were frequently thought to carry a risk of microwave radiation leaking out while in operation. Modern microwaves undergo more rigorous testing, rendering such risks slim to none if you are evaluating thermal damage only. However, when you look at biological damage, the energy densities are highly biologically significant.\n\nThe FDA limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts (mW) per square centimeter at approximately 2 inches from the oven surface. Because microwave energy decreases dramatically as you move away from the source of the radiation, a measurement made 20 inches from your oven would be approximately one-hundredth of the value measured at 2 inches. However, remember that biological effects have been well-documented at 0.01 MICROwatts, which is half a million times lower than the FDA standard.\n\nMicrowave Radiation Affects Your Heart\n\nA study16 published in 2010 examined the effects of 2.4 GHz radiation, which is the frequency of radiation emitted by Wi-Fi routers and microwave ovens, on the heart, finding 'unequivocal evidence' that microwave frequency radiation affects the heart at non-thermal levels that are well below federal safety guidelines. According to Magda Havas, Ph.D., of Trent University:\n\n'This is the first study that documents immediate and dramatic changes in both heart rate and heart rate variability caused by an approved device that generates microwaves at levels well below (0.3 percent) federal guidelines in both Canada and the United States.'\n\nThis is precisely what one would predict, as the density of the VGCCs are highest in nerve tissue like the pacemaker of the heart. This is why, if you know anyone being treated for an arrhythmia, you need to inform them of this as there is a high probability that their arrhythmia is related to their microwave exposure from cellphones, Wi-Fi, portable phones and smart meters.\n\nVGCCs in the brain are also very sensitive to this and are responsible for releasing neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones, which could contribute to depression, anxiety, ADHD and autism. Anyone with these health challenges would be best served mitigating microwave radiation exposure.\n\nMicrowaving Destroys Nutrients\n\nThere has been surprisingly little research on how microwaves affect organic molecules, or how the human body responds to consuming microwaved food. Considering most modern households use a microwave, you'd expect it to have been thoroughly investigated for safety, not only in terms of standing near it during operation, but also in terms of its impact on the food. Sadly, that's not the case.\n\nThe handful of studies that have been done generally agree, for the most part, that microwaving food damages its nutritional value. Heating food, in and of itself, can result in some nutrient loss, but using microwaves to heat food introduces the additional problem of the 'microwave effect,' a phenomenon that will be discussed in detail later.\n\nThe majority of studies on microwaves and nutrition were conducted prior to 2000, I suspect because the focus of radiation research of late has shifted toward a more ominous threat: environmental radiation from electromagnetic devices such as cellphones and computers. Nevertheless, some excellent scientific data has been gathered regarding the detrimental effects of microwaves on the nutrients in your food:\n\n✓ The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 200317 This study found that broccoli 'zapped' in the microwave with a little water lost up to 97 percent of its beneficial antioxidants. By comparison, steamed broccoli lost 11 percent or fewer of its antioxidants. There were also reductions in phenolic compounds and glucosinolates, but mineral levels remained intact. ✓ Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica B, 199918 This Scandinavian study, which evaluated changes in texture and nutritional quality of green asparagus spears during microwave blanching, caused a reduction in vitamin C. ✓ Journal of Nutrition, 200119 Here, as little as 60 seconds of microwave heating was enough to inactivate the allinase in garlic, which is the active ingredient against cancer. ✓ Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 199820 This Japanese study found that six minutes of microwave heating turned 30 to 40 percent of the B-12 in milk into an inert (dead) form. ✓ Bioelectromagnetics, 200821 This Australian study showed that microwaves cause a higher degree of 'protein unfolding' than conventional heating. ✓ Pediatrics, 199222 Microwaving has also been shown to destroy the essential disease-fighting agents in breast milk that offer protection for your baby. This 1992 study found microwaved breast milk lost lysozyme activity, antibodies, and fostered the growth of more potentially pathogenic bacteria. According to the author, more damage was done to the milk by microwaving than by other methods of heating.\n\nMicrowave Sickness\n\nWhen your tissues are directly exposed to microwaves, the same violent deformations occur and can cause 'microwave sickness.' People who have been exposed to high levels of microwave radiation experience a variety of symptoms, including:\n\n✓ Insomnia, night sweats and various sleep disturbances ✓ Swollen lymph nodes and a weakened immune system ✓ Headaches and dizziness ✓ Impaired cognition ✓ Depression and irritability ✓ Nausea and appetite loss ✓ Vision and eye problems ✓ Frequent urination and extreme thirst\n\nThere is a good amount of data emerging that people are suffering, to various degrees, these kinds of symptoms from living next to cellphone towers and other high-frequency radiation emitting antennas, which emit microwaves around the clock. According to Professor Franz Adlkofer, a leading scientist in the area of biological effects of EMF fields:23\n\n'There is real evidence that hyperfrequency electromagnetic fields can have geno-toxic effects. And this damaged DNA is always the cause of cancer. We've found these damaging effects on the genes at levels well below the safety limits. That's why we think it's urgent to base our safety limits on the biological effects, not the thermic ones. They should be based on biology, not on physics.'\n\nBreaking Free of Your Microwave: A Few Basic Tips\n\nHopefully, I have provided you with enough compelling information to stop using your microwave. If real estate in your kitchen is at a premium, your microwave should probably be the first thing to go. Contrary to popular belief, you can survive quite well without it. I tossed mine out last year and replaced it with a similar sized steam convention oven that cooks nearly as quickly as a microwave but safer.

"Four ‘awesome’ facts about Our Lady of Guadalupe\nThe word awesome has lost its zing.\n\n“Webster’s dictionary defines awesome as ‘anything that leaves you in awe and wonder.‘ Like winning the lottery - twice,” comedian Bill Engvall once said. “That would be awesome. Getting a phone call from the IRS saying you’ve been audited and they owe you $50,000. That would be awesome.”\n\nKnow what else would be awesome?\n\nSeeing an apparition of Mary, then having her grow roses in the middle of winter to prove it to the archbishop, then converting 9 million Aztecs within seven years.\n\nThat would be - wait - that was awesome.\n\nOn Dec. 12, the Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, marking the day when, in 1531, the Blessed Mother appeared in Mexico to a 57-year old peasant named Juan Diego.\n\nAccording to the earliest reliable account of the story, Juan Diego was walking near what is now Mexico City (Tepeyac Hill) when he came upon an apparition of a “maiden” whom he soon came to recognize as the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn trying to convince the archbishop of what he had seen, Juan Diego eventually was asked for a sign to prove what he had seen.\n\nUpon returning to Mary and sharing this with her, Juan Diego was instructed to climb to the top of the hill to gather flowers to bring back to the bishop. Reaching the crest of the hill, Juan Diego found Castilian roses, which were neither in season nor native to the region.\n\nThe Blessed Mother arranged the flowers herself in Juan’s tilma (a burlap-type cloak) and instructed him to open the cloak only upon return to the bishop.\n\nWhen Juan Diego arrived back at the bishop’s residence and opened his cloak, the flowers fell to the floor and left on the surface of the tilma was the image that’s come to be known as “Our Lady of Guadalupe”.\n\nWhat happened next is history.\n\nThe image became the wellspring of a conversion movement the likes of which have rarely been seen before or since.\n\nThe fact that the Virgin Mother not only spoke to Juan Diego in his native language, but appeared to be wearing the dress of an Aztec princess sparked millions of conversions to the Catholic faith in just under seven years.\n\nThe shrine that was subsequently built on the spot, where the original tilmacan still be seen, remains one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in the world.\n\nBut this post isn’t about the whole apparition story so much as it is about the tilma, Juan Diego’s cloak, on which the image of the Blessed Mother was imprinted. In the centuries following the event, some amazing and unexplainable qualities have been discovered about it.\n\nHere’s four literally awesome facts about the tilma of Our Lady of Guadalupe:\n\n1. It has qualities that are humanly impossible to replicate.\n\nMade primarily of cactus fibers, a tilma was typically of very poor quality and had a rough surface, making it difficult enough to wear, much less to paint a lasting image on it.\n\nNevertheless, the image remains, and scientists who have studied the image insist there was no technique used beforehand to treat the surface. The surface bearing the image is reportedly like silk to the touch, while the unused portion of the tilma remains coarse.\n\nWhat’s more, experts in infrared photography, studying the tilma in the late 1970s, determined that there were no brush strokes, as if the image was slapped onto the surface all at once.\n\nPhillip Callahan, a biophysicist at the University of Florida, discovered that the differences in texture and coloration that cause cause Our Lady’s skin to look different up close and far away is impossible to recreate:\n\nSuch a technique would be an impossible accomplishment in human hands. It often occurs in nature, however, in the coloring of bird feathers and butterfly scales, and on the elytra of brightly colored beetles … By slowly backing away from the painting, to a distance where the pigment and surface sculpturing blend together, the overwhelming beauty of the olive-colored Madonna emerges as if by magic.\n\nThis, along with an iridescent quality of slightly changing colors depending on the angle at which a person looks, and the fact that the coloration in the image was determined to have no animal or mineral elements, and synthetic colorings didn’t exist in 1531, provide a lot of seemingly unanswerable questions.\n\nThat’s awesome.\n\n2. People. say it’s just a painting, yet the tilma has outlived them all, in time and in quality.\n\nOne of the first things skeptics say about the image is that it somehow has to be a forgery or a fraud. Yet in every attempt to replicate the image, while the original never seems to fade, the duplicates have deteriorated over a short time.\n\nMiguel Cabrera, an artist in the mid-18th century who produced three of the best known copies - one for the archbishop, one for the pope, one for himself for later copies - once wrote about the difficulty of recreating the image even on the best surfaces:\n\nI believe that the most talented and careful painter, if he sets himself to copy this Sacred Image on a canvas of this poor quality, without using sizing, and attempting to imitate the four media employed, would at last after great and wearisome travail, admit that he had not succeeded. And this can be clearly verified in the numerous copies that have been made with the benefit of varnish, on the most carefully prepared canvases, and using only one medium, oil, which offers the greatest facility;\n\nAdolfo Orozco, a physicist at the National University of Mexico, spoke in 2009 about the remarkable preservation of the tilma compared to its numerous copies.\n\nOne copy created in 1789 was painted on a similar surface with the best techniques available at the time, then encased in glass and stored next to the actual tilma.\n\nIt looked beautiful when painted, but not eight years passed before the hot and humid climate of Mexico caused the duplicate to fade and fray. It was discarded.\n\nHowever, Orozco said, no scientific explanation is possible for the fact that, “the original tilma was exposed for approximately 116 years without any kind of protection, receiving all the infrared and ultraviolet radiation from the tens of thousands of candles near it and exposed to the humid and salty air around the temple.”\n\nThat’s awesome.\n\n3. The tilma has shown characteristics startlingly like a living human body.\n\nIn 1979, when Callahan, the Florida biophysicist, was analyzing the tilmausing infrared technology, he apparently also discovered that the tilmamaintains a constant temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the same as that of a living person.\n\nWhen Carlos Fernandez del Castillo, a Mexican gynecologist, examined the tilma, he first noticed a four-petaled flower over what was Mary’s womb.\n\nThe flower, called the Nahui Ollin by the Aztecs, was a symbol of the sun and a symbol of plenitude.\n\nUpon further examination, Castillo concluded that the dimensions of Our Lady’s body in the image were that of an expectant mother due quite soon. Dec. 9, the day of the unveiling, is barely two weeks from Christmas.\n\nOne of the most common attributions and reported discoveries lie with the Virgin’s eyes in the image.\n\nWhen Jose Aste Tonsmann, a Peruvian ophthalmologist, conducted a study, one of his tests involved examining the eyes on the tilma at 2,500 times magnification.\n\nWith the images of the magnified eyes, the scientist was reportedly able to identify as many as 13 individuals in both eyes at different proportions, just as the human eye would reflect an image.\n\nIt appeared to be a snapshot of the very moment Juan Diego unfurled the tilma before the archbishop.\n\nThat’s awesome.\n\n4. It appears to be virtually indestructible.\n\nOver the centuries, two separate events had the potential to harm the tilma, one in 1785 and one in 1921.\n\nIn 1785, a worker was cleaning the glass encasement of the image when he accidentally spilled strong nitric acid solvent onto a large portion of the image itself.\n\nThe image and the rest of the tilma, which should have been eaten away almost instantly by the spill, reportedly self-restored over the next 30 days, and it remains unscathed to this day, aside from small stains on the parts not bearing the image.\n\nIn 1921, an anti-clerical activist hid a bomb containing 29 sticks of dynamite in a pot of roses and placed it before the image inside the Basilica at Guadalupe.\n\nWhen the bomb exploded, the marble altar rail and windows 150 feet shattered. A brass crucifix was twisted and bent out of shape. But the tilmaand its glass case remained fully intact.\n\nThat’s awesome.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Mountain Catholic.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.rcatholics.com/four-awesome-facts-lady-guadalupe/","None"

"US Surgeon, Who Exposed Clinton Foundation Corruption In Haiti, Found Dead\nDr. Dean Lorich, an orthopedic surgeon who volunteered in Haiti and exposed Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice on the island, has been found dead in New York. He was 54.\n\nDr. Lorich was found by his 11-year-old daughter on the bathroom floor of his tony Upper East Side apartment with a knife in his chest at around 1pm on Monday.\n\nThe knife missed the surgeon’s heart, leaving him to bleed out and be found by his daughter. Despite the fact police were called to the property regarding an “assault“, they instantly registered the death as “suicide” and closed the case.\n\nOne of the United States’ leading surgeons, Dr. Lorich was part of the relief effort sent by the U.S. to assist the relief effort led by the Clinton Foundation in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. However Dr. Lorich was disgusted by the “shameful” Clinton Foundation operation, and voiced his concerns to Hillary Clinton directly.\n\nUnsatisfied with her response, he went public, writing an article published by CNN, accusing the Clinton Foundation of widespread corruption and malpractice in Haiti that cost the lives of thousands of children.\n\nBillions of dollars were raised by the Clinton Foundation to help the Haitians, but the vast bulk of this money was funneled to Clinton friends and associates, according to Dr. Lorich, who described in harrowing detail what this meant for the children of Haiti.\n\nDr. Lorich argued that, in essence, Clinton greed left Haitian children to die painful deaths:\n\n“We expected many amputations. But we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable, particularly those of children. We recognized that in an underdeveloped country, a limb amputation may be a death sentence. It does not have to be so.“\n\n“Shameful”\n\nConsidering billions of dollars had been donated to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of helping the Haitians, Dr Lorich and his team expected to have full support when their plane touched down.\n\nInstead, Dr. Lorich described the situation on the ground as “shameful” and he witnessed Clinton Foundation corruption in action. The Haitians were receiving no help whatsoever.\n\nAccording to Dr. Lorich, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up helping citizens of Haiti. 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.\n\nDr. Lorich’s WikiLeaks emails\n\nUnable to perform his duties – and disgusted by the rampant corruption – Dr. Lorich sent an email to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Chief of Staff Cheryl D. Mills to report what he had seen. The email was then forwarded to Hillary Clinton which meant it eventually found its way into WikiLeaks’ possession and can be read here.\n\nUnsatisfied with the lack of response from Hillary Clinton, Dr. Lorich went public, co-authored the CNN article that exposed the Clinton Foundation’s corruption and malpractice in Haiti:\n\n“We found scores of patients with pus dripping out of open extremity fractures and crush injuries,” reported Dr. Lorich.\n\n“Some wounds were already ridden with maggots.“\n\n“About a third of these victims were children.“\n\n“The entire hospital smelled of infected, rotting limbs and death.“\n\n“Later on, we would judge our surgical progress by the diminishment of the stench.”\n\n“As we got up and running and organized the patients for surgery, we told our contacts in the United States [the Clintons] what we needed.“\n\nUnfortunately the Clinton Foundation did not provide that help, despite pocketing billions of dollars from donors with the express purpose of providing medical support to desperate Haitians.\n\n“We left feeling as if we abandoned these patients, the country, and its people, and we feel terrible,” Dr. Lorich wrote, adding: “Our flight of critical medical equipment and personnel had been canceled.“\n\nThe father of three girls, Dr. Lorich was the associate director of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, as well as the Chief of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at New York Presbyterian Hospital.","http://yournewswire.com/surgeon-clinton-haiti-dead/","1513096320.0"

"Clint Eastwood Just Received Terribly Tragic News -\n41.5k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nWithin the liberal dominated movie industry, celebrities who are sufficiently courageous to voice their conservative ideology are met with incredible amount of disrespect. That’s the exact reason why stars like Clinton Eastwood make such an impression when they speak up about America’s security.\n\nThis previous week, the well known director announced that his next movie will be dedicated to being courageous in the face of the radical Islamic terrorism. Even now, he comes by heavy insults due to his decision to concentrate his controversial movie on the terror attack that happened on a French Train back in August 2015.\n\nEastwood intends to use the film in a form of a tribute to the three honorable men who put a stop to the attack and eventually captured the terrorist. Americans Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Briton Chris Norman were boarded on a train from Brussels to Paris when a terrorist came in a bathroom and exited it with an AK47. The three gutsy men put their lives at risk in order to defeat the terrorist before he could claim anyone’s life.\n\nEastwood is almost immune to criticism.

"Pluto Has Been Officially Reclassified As A Planet!\nIn Brief Please note: This article was written for April Fools 2017. The end of the article clarifies this point. However, we decided to post this short message at the top after April 1, lest anyone reading not read to the end and become confused.\n\nToday is a historic day—one that will bring joy to the hundreds of millions of Pluto lovers around the globe. The International Astronomical Union (IAU), the body that is responsible for naming and classifying objects in the cosmos, has just announced that Pluto has been reclassified as a major planet.\n\nThat’s right, the little dwarf will be rejoining the ranks of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Planet-X (the planet that will surely spell doom for all humanity).\n\nAs many of you know, in 2006, the IAU made their infamous vote, deciding to demote everyone’s favorite planet to a “dwarf planet.” Their reasoning was that too many people would confuse Pluto (the doggy of Disney fame) with Pluto (the planet, of space and stuff). Immediately after this 2006 announcement, the public exploded with outrage. There were a number of campaigns launched that were aimed at ensuring that Pluto was reinstated as a planet. These met with no success.\n\nPluto was officially classified as a dwarf planet.\n\nBut all of that just changed, After years of deliberation, the IAU announced in a press release that they have reclassified the icy world—they upgraded Pluto back to its proper standing as a planet. “We simply underestimated the public’s attachment to Pluto. We realized our error shortly after the decision came down to demote it,” said Dr. Amy Joggy, professor at the Institute of Planetary Studies and head of the IAU’s Planetary Classification and Experimental Nomenclature Task Force. “We didn’t think anyone would really care if a little clump of ice and rock on the outskirts of the solar system was reclassified. Clearly, we dun messed up, and that makes me super sad face. Today, we take steps to correct this most grievous of errors.”\n\nIn addition to Pluto’s reclassification, Dr. Joggy has also proposed that the IAU create a new category of planet called a “hyper-planet.” These hyper-planets, according to Dr. Joggy, are like regular planets but at least two times as awesome (thanks to the fancy, fancy name).\n\nIt has also been proposed that Pluto be made an honorary member of this new planetary class. “In all honesty, we feel bad for the way we treated Pluto and, more importantly, all those that cared about it so greatly- the public showed us our error. Hopefully, the new class of planet will be created without a hitch, and Pluto will be added as the first member. It’s only fair.”\n\nSay it with me now, “Yay!” …also, have a happy April Fool’s.","https://futurism.com/pluto-reclassified-as-a-major-planet/","1491033623.0"

Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.\n\nMr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.\n\nMr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel? And now he wants to be in a position that is liable to cause us hardships in the international arena.”\n\nTownhall.com reports: Further gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. “moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,” the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying.\n\nU.N.

"Trump Just Ended Obama’s Vacation Scam And Sent Him A Bill You Have To See To Believe\nBefore Obama left office he arranged with the State Department for a series of “official visits” to foreign countries spanning the next 20 years. Using discretionary funds from the Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations, Obama was able to weasel what would have been another $2.1 billion in free vacations for him and up to 24 members of his family plus staff and a dog sitter until the year 2036.\n\n.\n\nHe would have, that is, had he not lost his office to Donald Trump. Trump, who is always looking for ways to save money, was having the office used for vacations repainted when he was presented with a ledger that contained all of the Obama travel plans and expenses. The ledger was found by one of the 31 workers Trump hired from outside the typical White House staff to make alterations requiring specialized craftsmen.\n\n.\n\nOur President immediately canceled the plans and recalled all Secret Service agents scheduled to protect the Obamas anywhere outside of the United States. The Obamas, who are still waiting in Kenya for their documents so they can re-enter the country, are also facing another new challenge at the hands of Trump: They’re going to have to repay the government for all of those vacations that weren’t official state business.\n\n.\n\nThe bill, after some small allowances for days that were possibly work related, is for $214 million. Of the 692 days the Obamas spent on vacation, almost none included any work at all. They ate, slept and golfed and Michelle was given shopping allowances from the Office of Discretionary Gifting Funds, which is supposed to be used to buy presents for visiting dignitaries.\n\n.\n\nIt’s just one scandal after another with these people.","https://mainerepublicemailalert.com/2017/02/16/trump-just-ended-obamas-vacation-scam-and-sent-him-a-bill-you-have-to-see-to-believe/","1487221200.0"
"Woman Gives Birth to Puppies in Western Cape After Having Sex With Their Family Dog\nDoctors at a Western Cape private hospital were surprised to see Kedder go into labor, as she didn’t know she was pregnant.\n\n“It was even more of a shock when three tiny puppies came out instead of a baby,” said Dr. Brown of the Medical Center where Kedder gave birth to her ‘puppies’. “To be honest, we didn’t know this was possible. It’s both a marvel of modern medicine and extremely disturbing at the same time.”\n\nKedder admits that while she was recently living at home, she would often have sex with the family dog, Jonsey, because she couldn’t find a date.\n\nIt all started when my parents moved to a new place while we were still based in Germany. I lost my job, and my boyfriend dumped me too,” said Kedder. “I didn’t have time to meet any new guys while I was applying for jobs, so I would sometimes have sex with Jonsey our dog, just to relieve myself of too much stress. I don’t think it was wrong. He’s a big dog, and he wasn’t hurt by it. In fact, he really seemed to like it. I know I did. And besides, back in our country having sex with an animal is not a crime, and I don’t giving birth to an animal would either be a crime here provided the act wasn’t committed in this country,” she said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Brown, Kedder’s birth is the first on record for an inter-species relationship. “This opens up a lot of doors in science and medicine that we thought were closed,” said Dr. Brown. “The fact that her eggs were able to be implanted by canine sperm, it’s just, well it’s just amazing. Still really, really gross, but definitely amazing.”\n\nWhile it a crime to have sex with an animal in South Africa, however in Germany it is not a crime at all. A 2013 report from the Daily Mail News warned that bestiality brothels are spreading throughout Germany. The sam way you hire a prostitute here, is the same way you hire any animal for sex in German.\n\nPeople are calling it a “lifestyle choice” when wanting to commit to having relations with animals. The bestiality brothels are referred to as “erotic zoos.”\n\nBestiality brothels are raging through Germany because of a law that makes animal x-rated films illegal, but sex with animals is still okay.\n\nIn one case, a German farmer noticed that his flock of sheep started to shy away from human contact. So he added cameras and found that during the evenings, men were sneaking onto his land to have sex with his animals.","http://now8news.com/woman-gives-birth-puppies-western-cape-sex-family-dog/","1492445823.0"
"DELINGPOLE: ‘Global Warming’ Is a Myth, Say 58 Scientific Papers in 2017\n“Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.\n\nIn other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true.\n\nBy “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that.\n\nRather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown.\n\nWhat all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact.\n\nThat is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story.\n\nLate 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary.\n\nHere, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it.\n\nBüntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today\n\nAbrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era.\n\nHere’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago\n\nHere’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries:\n\nAnd on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it.\n\nThe intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda.\n\nHere are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing.\n\nNot that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.”\n\nStill, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too.\n\nThey do so hate that fact, the Greenies.","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/06/delingpole-global-warming-is-myth-58-scientific-papers-2017/","1496721600.0"

"DELINGPOLE: ‘Nearly All’ Recent Global Warming Is Fabricated, Study Finds\nMuch of recent global warming has been fabricated by climate scientists to make it look more frightening, a study has found.\n\nThe peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets (GAST) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “the hottest evah” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented.\n\nWhat they found is that these readings are “totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.”\n\nThat is, the adjusted data used by alarmist organizations like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office differs so markedly from the original raw data that it cannot be trusted.\n\nThis chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.\n\nThe blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.\n\nNote how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century.\n\nAccording to meteorologist Joe D’Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso, this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend:\n\n“Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments.” “Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming.” “You would think that when you make adjustments you’d sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling. That’s almost never happened.”\n\nWhat this means, the report concludes, is that claims by NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office that the world is experiencing unprecedented and dramatic warming should be taken with a huge pinch of salt: they all use the same corrupted global average temperature (GAST) data.","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/07/09/delingpole-nearly-all-recent-global-warming-is-fabricated-study-finds/","1499572800.0"
"Trump on Revamping the Military: We’re Bringing Back the Draft\nCOSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\n“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”\n\nDonald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County.

"Melania Trump Bans Monsanto Products From The White House\nFirst Lady Melania Trump has banned Monsanto products from the White House after learning of the health effects associated with consuming genetically modified (GM) corn, according to reports.\n\nWhile public debate rages about the safety of genetically modified food, Melania Trump says that as far as she is concerned, GM products are best avoided.\n\n“Barron’s health has improved out of sight since we started eating organic, non genetically modified food,” the First Lady said.\n\nAfter researching exactly where Monsanto’s genetically modified corn appeared in her family’s diet and becoming concerned about potential negative health effects, Melania Trump said she was “amazed at the place this company has in the food chain“.\n\nThe First Lady, who proudly describes herself as a “full-time mom“, then realized that Monsanto produces other genetically modified crops such as soy, sugar beets, and cotton – and these products form the foundation of many American’s diets.\n\nIn the interests of her son Barron’s health – as well as her own – Melania decided to eliminate processed foods containing GM crops from her family home.\n\nBut as Melania explained, this wasn’t as easy as it sounds. 70 to 80 percent of American processed foods contain genetically engineered ingredients, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of America.\n\nWhile the FDA attempts to convince us that GM foods are safe, scientists working for the agency have repeatedly warned that the opposite is true.\n\nThese brave FDA scientists, speaking out against the official company line pushed by their corrupt superiors, have repeatedly warned that GM foods can create unpredictable, hard-to-detect side effects, including allergies, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems.\n\nThey have urged long-term safety studies, but have been ignored by the agency.\n\nHealth Risks\n\nSeveral animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with genetically modified food, including infertility, immune problems, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulation, and changes in major organs and the gastrointestinal system. The American Academy of Environmental Medicine has asked physicians to advise all patients to avoid GM foods.\n\nYet since 1996, Americans have been eating GM ingredients in most processed foods. Why isn’t the FDA protecting us?\n\nThe sad fact is that we cannot rely on the FDA to protect us. We must do our own research and educate ourselves.\n\n[High Fructose Corn Syrup Quietly, Deceitfully Renamed]\n\nIn the First Lady’s case, her self-education led to her total ban on Monsanto tainted products in her household, exclusively ordering organic products that were not grown with GM seeds.\n\nMelania said that in order to live up to the commitment she had to do a lot of research.\n\n“I have a friend who is a sustainable food advocate, and I got in touch with dozens of health food stories and manufacturers to ask where they sourced their products,” the First Lady said.\n\nIn order to completely avoid Monsanto products, the consumer must research the origins of their food.\n\n“I spent a lot of time at farmers’ markets asking farmers what seed companies they buy from, googling on my phone before making purchases.\n\n“It took a few months but I finally managed to get Monsanto out of my life completely.“\n\nThe influence that Monsanto has over U.S. food production is profound, and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking, you realize that Monsanto is everywhere. And, unfortunately, their influence is not benign.\n\nBut as Melania Trump says, once you educate yourself and then make the effort to avoid Monsanto, you will find peace of mind, and the health of your family will improve.","http://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-bans-monsanto/","1496168089.0"
"BREAKING: Muslim Waitress Refuses To Seat 27-Person Church Group Because ‘Religious Freedom’\nThe meaning of “religious freedom” has been repeatedly perverted by liberal perverts over the years, but Muslim waitress Sallah al-Sallah took things farther than usual when she used it to take away the rights of 27 Christians, many of whom were children.\n\nThe St. Pleasant Allegorical Church of the Divine decided to do something nice for the people in the choir and take them out to dinner at the Waffle House in Arnbur, Michigan — but their fun evening took a horrible turn when they met al-Sallah.\n\nThe church group had called ahead to let the restaurant know they had a large party, but when they arrived they told Sallah their group name and she instantly became “combative” according to Pastor Joe Friedrichs.\n\n“She told us she couldn’t seat us,” Friedrichs told the Arnbur Explorer in an interview published the day after the incident. ”\n\n“She said that she was forbidden by her holy book to feed ‘infidels’ like us” and that she “could not take part in our meal in any way, even by seating us,” Friedrichs explained, adding that the group asked if another employee could help them. al-Sallah told them the restaurant was “shorthanded.”\n\nThe group left peacefully but were “accosted” by police who received a complaint that they were trespassing on the property. The officer left without citing anyone.\n\nThe restaurant refused comment, but confirmed that the hostess was still employed at the Waffle House and would not be fired because she was “acting within the bounds of religious freedom.”\n\nThe St Pleasant Church is considering a civil rights lawsuit.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.online/2018/01/03/breaking-muslim-waitress-refuses-to-seat-27-person-church-group-because-religious-freedom/","1514955600.0"
"Haiti Official Getting Ready To Testify Against Clinton Foundation Corruption NEXT WEEK, Found DEAD With “Gunshot to the head”\nIt’s absolutely clear that the Clinton Foundation has faced some honest reports of stealing from impoverished Haitians devastated in the 2008 Hurricane Hanna, and straight through their own foundation. For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a “gunshot to the head” that’s been ruled a “suicide” by the Miami-Dade’s medical examiner records supervisor.\n\nKlaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.\n\nEberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.\n\nEberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation’s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8% – or $5.4 billion – was funneled to non-Haitian organizations.\n\n“The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,” Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.\n\nThe former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.\n\nAccording to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in “good spirits“, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide.\n\n“It’s really shocking,” said Muncheez’s owner Gilbert Bailly. “We grew up together; he was like family.” –Your News Wire\n\nAmericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton’s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton’s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.\n\nSansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to “side” with the Clinton Administration and he would “be the richest man in Haiti.”\n\nHe also demanded that Hillary Clinton “disclose the audit of all money” related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation.\n\n“Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti.”\n\nGo to the 5 minute mark of the video to see Sansaricq’s comments to candidate Trump:\n\nLike this: Like Loading...","https://web.archive.org/web/http://theuspoliticalnews.com/haiti-official-getting-ready-to-testify-against-clinton-foundation-corruption-next-week-found-dead-with-gunshot-to-the-head/","1515977110.0"
"BREAKING: America's Worst Nightmare About Texas Church Shooter Just Confirmed\n19.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nThe second attack this week to take the lives of innocent Americans just struck again during the most innocent of activities, just five days after the first. On Tuesday, eight were ruthlessly killed in New York and now 27 more have lost their lives this week in a senseless attack on churchgoers in Texas. As the media scrambles to blame this on the gun in a push for more control, the country’s worst nightmare was just confirmed about who the shooter is and what he set out to accomplish.\n\nAmericans, specifically Christians are under attack in these trying days prophesized about in the Bible that we are seeing come to fruition under the most terrifying terms. In September, white Tennessee churchgoers were ambushed and killed by a gunman in an unprovoked attack that was swiftly swept under the rug by the mainstream media desperate to hide the important details and keep the attention on irrelevant issues like Russian collusion. Now, the blood of 27 faithful believers is now on their hands after disregarding the clear and present threat in this country to keep the focus on their rhetoric. There’s no hiding what’s happening now and every American needs to be on high alert for what’s coming.\n\nJust a few short hours after a gunman stormed the small Sutherland Springs, TX church, we’re seeing that the dead suspect is white, but his race had nothing to do with what he did. While his race and other irrelevant factors is what we’ll hear most about from the mainstream media, there a much larger fact about this suspect that is absolutely everything that Americans must know right now.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports:\n\nThe mass shooter who opened fire inside a Texas church killing at least 27 – including a two-year-old child – has been identified as a 26-year-old former Bible study teacher who was dishonorably discharged from the US Air Force.\n\nDevin Patrick Kelley walked into the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, dressed in full combat gear, and began shooting, according to local law enforcement sources.\n\nKelley, 26, of New Braunfels, a suburb of San Antonio, was killed after a brief foot chase into Guadalupe County, according to Guadalupe County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Robert Murphy. But it’s still unclear if the gunman shot himself or was taken down by authorities. San Antonio police raided Kelley’s home on Sunday evening, with K9 and bomb squad units.\n\nWhile this seems like a random attack from a psychotic white guy who the left will use as a poster child for more gun control, his reasoning for arming up and taking over a building full of Christians was because of is religion. “The shooter is dead. He has not been officially identified, but Mustachio Tweeted: ‘#texaschurchshooting shooter is 29-year-old US marine turned Muslim convert, Samir Al-Hajeed. His manifesto is making its rounds on the web,'” the Santa Monica Observer reported.\n\n“Pres. Trump is in Japan. He tweeted ‘May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs. The FBI is on scene, and I am monitoring the situation,'” the Observer added. “At least 27 people were killed and around 27 injured in a Texas church shooting Sunday morning, law enforcement sources told ABC News.”\n\n“The alleged shooter is dead, and it appears there is no longer an active threat at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 40 miles southeast of San Antonio, police told ABC News.”\n\n“A person who said she works at a gas station across the street from the church told ABC News she heard rapid gunfire at around 11:15 a.m., leading congregants from the church as well as customers at the station to run inside for cover. ‘We heard several shots and we all started running inside the store,’; she said.” ‘It lasted about 15 seconds. I yelled, ‘Get down! Get inside!’ and we all went into hiding,” said the woman, who said she is 49 but declined to give her name. She said the gas station locked its doors. ‘We have not reopened,’ she said.”\n\n“She then that within minutes of the gunfire, emergency personnel had arrived at the scene. ‘There were officers that were checking the wounded in here were asking them questions,’ she said.”\n\nThe Daily Mail has more on this white man-turned-terrorist and the horrific crime he perpetrated on the faithful:\n\nKelley, who was reportedly married, had recently posted a photo of an AR-15 style gun on his Facebook page with the caption: ‘She’s a bad b***h.’\n\nA LinkedIn account which appears to be Kelley’s states that he joined the US Air Force after graduating New Braunfels High School in 2009. He worked in logistics and supply in the Air Force until he was dishonorably discharged in 2014 and was even court-martialed in May 2014, CBS News reported.\n\nHe then volunteered as a teacher for Bible studies at Kingsville First Baptist Church, according to his LinkedIn which shows him posing which a young child.\n\nWilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr told CNN that at least 27 people have been killed in the shooting, but the death toll is expected to climb. The first responders on the scene were from local churches who began receiving texts from family and friends about the shooting.\n\nThe Connally Memorial Medical Center said ‘multiple’ victims are being treated.\n\n“My heart is broken,” Gamez said. “We never think where it can happen, and it does happen. It doesn’t matter where you’re at. In a small community, real quiet and everything, and look at this, what can happen.”\n\nAt least 24 others were injured in the horrific shooting, including four kids from the same family. They include a five-year-old boy – named only as Rylan – who was shot four times and is currently undergoing emergency surgery in hospital, two girls, aged 5 and 7, who are also in surgery, and an 8-year-old who hid under a pew during the shooting. It is believed to have been the worst shooting at a place of worship in American history.\n\nWith0ut a doubt, the mainstream media and every anti-Trump liberal will focus on this killer’s identity as a white male, rather than a Muslim convert. The latter factor was the driving force behind his crime and not the physical description of him.","https://web.archive.org/web/https://freedomdaily.com/breaking-the-texas-church-shooter-is-a-muslim-this-is-terrorism/","1509928055.0"
"Citizens United : A Week Later\nI had planned to write a piece for HuffPost about having serious hang time with all the corporations now that thanks to the Supreme Court they've achieved the full Pinocchio-like state of (cue magical gliss) 'person-hood.' I was going to treat the Corps like 'bros' I was picking up for a night of beers and pool and make some jokes about Goldman Sachs claiming he was broke and asking me to spot him a few billion and then me catching him floating a billion to the bartender as a bonus for pouring a kick-ass Jägerbomb. I was then going to joke about Exxon getting a separate check where he only paid half the taxes I did on my bill. And then CIGNA is allowed to collude with all other pool players about how to beat me. Finally a fight would break out and all the Corps would hightail it out of the bar leaving me to get my ass kicked because the Corps were under no obligation to join any wars other than for their own profit. And as they run down the street I hear them laughing and joking in Chinese, German, and twenty other different languages....\n\n\n\nBut the recent Supreme Court decision on Citizens United v. FEC is so assaultive and destructive towards our country and the welfare of our democracy that any kind of cleverness feels pointless. Sort of like doing a sly political cartoon about being kicked in the head. What the Supreme Court -- specifically Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy -- has done, is nothing short of a violent coup for the corporations to seize control of our government. There's no violence yet, but it will come in the form of many more profit-driven corporate wars in the molds of Vietnam and Iraq and the jailing of millions more non-violent offenders to fuel the corporate built and run prisons. Not to mention dramatic rises in the crime rate as the middle class completely disappears.\n\nWhat (I'll write their names again, because they should not be forgotten) Roberts, Thomas, Scalia, Alito and Kennedy are guilty of is treason. There is no other name for it. Using very flimsy law, they have betrayed the very idea of our nation, a nation founded on checks and balances as a way to dilute concentrated power. Because time and time again it has corrupted and distorted. We saw the devastating effects of big business's hold on government with the robber barons and the Great Depression in the early 20th century, but the corporations reconstituted and waited with an inhuman silver-dude-from-Terminator-2-like patience. After years of bad headlines and unflattering news reports the corporations bought the headlines and news reports and from that moment on, deprived of real information, their opposition (us!) shrank and shriveled. And best of all, an entire nation turned into bored gossips, concerned about who was cheating on who and who got plastic surgery (Hint: Season 6 of Survivor!). From that moment on, anyone who talked about what was going on became a crazy unpatriotic liberal or worse yet, not a lot of fun.\n\nSo it's fitting that what happened last week played about fifth in the news cycle, well behind the Leno/Conan soap opera and way behind the NFL playoffs.\n\nAnd just in case you think I'm overreacting, read the dissenting opinion from SCOTUS.\n\nThe only remaining question is, does it really end like this?\n\nOr can all the 'right wingers' and 'left wingers' or, as the corporations call us both, 'suckers' wake up?\n\nAs for now there are a few things that can be done:\n\n1. Tell everyone you know about this decision and how it will affect us. Word of mouth and the internet are the only press we have left. (Okay, and Stewart, Moyers and Rachel Maddow).\n\n2. Sign Congressman Grayson's petition\n\n3. Pay attention to the millions and billions about to be set loose on our elections. The network news won't do it for you.\n\nBenito Mussolini created the word 'fascism.' He defined it as 'the merging of the state and the corporation.' He also said a more accurate word would be 'corporatism.' This was the definition in Webster's up until 1987 when a corporation bought Webster's and changed it to exclude any mention of corporations.\n\nNeedless to say, there were no news stories covering this. But I think that same year Richard Dawson stopped hosting Family Feud and Van Halen switched from David Lee Roth to Sammy Hagar. Remember that? I do.","https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-mckay/icitizens-unitedi-a-week_b_436164.html/","1269681121.0"
"Child Abduction Epidemic Hits Kansas – 70 Reported This Week Alone\nMore than 70 children have been reported missing in the past week in north-east Kansas, as lawmakers admit the city is gripped by a “child abduction epidemic.”\n\nAccording to reports, the epidemic of missing children began after three sisters went missing from a northeast Kansas foster home on Aug. 26.\n\nSince then, an unprecedented number of missing children cases have been reported in recent weeks, with the situation becoming critical in the last few days.\n\nLawmakers have also raised concerns that Kansas Department for Children and Families Secretary Phyllis Gilmore is claiming to be completely “unaware” that children are being abducted at epidemic rates in the state’s north-east.\n\nThe Witchita Eagle reports: Sen. Laura Kelly, D-Topeka, told a child welfare task force meeting that when she raised the missing children with DCF on Tuesday, the agency knew nothing.\n\n“I am flabbergasted,” Kelly said. “I used to work in this world years and years ago and I understand that where you have teenagers, you will have runners and they will go and they will do this kind of stuff.”\n\n“But the fact that the person in charge of the wards of the state has no idea that these kids are missing from her custody is just astounding to me.”\n\nAfter the meeting, Gilmore said she could not discuss the three missing sisters, ages 15, 14 and 12, who police think fled their foster home in Tonganoxie.\n\nThe Kansas City Star reported on their case earlier Tuesday, prompting Kelly to question Gilmore and others.\n\n“You heard everyone expressing that it is extremely concerning and worrisome, especially when many of them are teenage girls in the light of the issues surrounding human trafficking,” Gilmore said.\n\nBut she also said that in many cases, children have left to go back to their biological families or other people with whom they have a relationship in order to try to not be in foster care.\n\nGilmore referenced one task force member’s comment that at times children who have fled will call to say they are safe but won’t say where they are.\n\n“So it isn’t always a tragedy but some certainly can be and that’s why we have to take it all very seriously,” Gilmore said.\n\nKVC Kansas, one of the foster care contractors, said it has 38 missing children.\n\nThe other company, Saint Francis Community Services, said 36 are missing in its system.\n\nChad Anderson, chief clinical officer at KVC Kansas, one of the contractors, told a child welfare task force that the number of missing represented about 1 percent of the foster care population and is in line with the national average.\n\nStill, he acknowledged the contractor could do a better job.\n\n“I don’t know that we as contractors have shared as much in terms of missing youth and the day to day as we probably should,” Anderson said.\n\nRep. Linda Gallagher, R-Lenexa, said she was shocked at the number of missing children.\n\nEven if the number missing is in line with the national average, she said, it is still too many.\n\nShe also said it was “unbelievable” that Gilmore “didn’t know” about the missing children epidemic.","http://yournewswire.com/child-abduction-epidemic-kansas/","1507828509.0"
"The Obama Vacation Scandal Is Finally Over And We Have Trump To Thank\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 61.3k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nBefore Obama left office he arranged with the State Department for a series of “official visits” to foreign countries spanning the next 20 years. Using discretionary funds from the Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations, Obama was able to weasel what would have been another $2.1 billion in free vacations for him and up to 24 members of his family plus staff and a dog sitter until the year 2036.\n\nHe would have, that is, had he not lost his office to Donald Trump. Trump, who is always looking for ways to save money, was having the office used for vacations repainted with 24 karat gold leaf trim and having the shelves lined with leather when he was presented with a ledger that contained all of the travel plans and expenses. The ledger was found by one of the 31 workers Trump hired from outside the typical White House staff to make alterations requiring specialized craftsmen.\n\nOur President immediately canceled the plans and recalled all Secret Service agents scheduled to protect the Obamas anywhere outside of the United States. The Obamas, who are still waiting in Kenya for their documents so they can re-enter the country, are also facing another new challenge at the hands of Trump: They’re going to have to repay the government for all of those vacations that weren’t official state business.\n\nThe bill, after some small allowances for days that were possibly work related, is for $214 million. Of the 692 days the Obamas spent on vacation, almost none included any work at all. They ate, slept and golfed and Michelle was given shopping allowances from the Office of Discretionary Gifting Funds, which is supposed to be used to buy presents for visiting dignitaries.\n\nIt’s just one scandal after another with these people.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-trump-just-ended-obamas-vacation-scam-and-sent-him-a-bill-you-have-to-see-to-believe/","1487002346.0"
"Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because “Santa Was Always White In The Bible”\nThe announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.\n\nAmong many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nShe also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”\n\n“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”\n\n“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.","http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/","1480789769.0"
"Beyonce: ‘DNA Tests Reveal I Am Descended From Illuminati Bloodlines’\nBeyonce says she deserves her position at the apex of the entertainment industry not because she is talented, beautiful or hard-working, but because she is “descended from Illuminati bloodlines,” according to reports.\n\nRevealing that a “DNA test kit” given to her by Gwyneth Paltrow’s 13-year-old daughter Apple Martin “opened up a whole new world to me” and “created my obsession with tracing my family tree”, Beyonce told close friends and associates on Jay-Z’s Family Feud video shoot that her family is “closely related” to the Bush family, Rockefeller dynasty and “the Queen of England.”\n\n“We are related to the Rockefellers on my Mom’s side. I thought that was something but we are also not-so-distant cousins of the British Royal Family,” Beyonce boasted.\n\nOne of the most powerful families in the world, the Rockefellers have extreme wealth and power. Beyond their holdings in real estate and industry, as well as their political connections, the Rockefellers have given large amounts of money to religious organizations, which are alleged by Illuminati watchers to actually be training grounds for Satanists.\n\nThe Rockefellers were also instrumental in forming key Illuminati front groups like the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThe Formation singer, who has a personal fortune of $500 million, also claimed to be related to the Bush family through ties on her father’s side of the family tree.\n\n“We got Bush blood running through our veins. Shame it isn’t Obama blood. But it’s presidential blood, twice over,” Beyonce boasted.\n\nWHO ARE THE ILLUMINATI?\n\nThe Illuminati is the name given to an elite secretive organization of world leaders, business owners, and other powerful members of this planet.\n\nTheir plan is to control humanity and the planet’s limited resources by consolidating the world’s finances, natural resources, military and media into entities they control.\n\n13 illuminati bloodlines sit on top of the power pyramid, secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes. The Council of the 13 families orchestrates all of the major world events. As the name suggests, the Council consists of the top 13 most influential families on Earth.\n\nThe Illuminati have a set of goals in order to fulfil their masterplan. As of 2018, many of the goals have been fulfilled, with the rest of them looming on the horizon:\n\n1. To establish a One World Government/New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their direction. The One World Government began to set up its church in the 1920s and 30s, for they realized the need for a religious belief inherent in mankind must have an outlet and, therefore, set up a “church” body to channel that belief in the direction they desired.\n\n2. To bring about the utter destruction of all national identity and national pride, which was a primary consideration if the concept of a One World Government was to work.\n\n3. To engineer and bring about the destruction of religion, and more especially, the Christian Religion, with the one exception, their own creation, as mentioned above.\n\n4. To establish the ability to control of each and every person through means of mind control and what Zbignew Brzezinski called techonotronics, which would create human-like robots and a system of terror which would make Felix Dzerzinhski’s Red Terror look like children at play.\n\n5. To bring about the end to all industrialization and to end the production of nuclear generated electric power in what they call “the post-industrial zero-growth society”. Excepted are the computer- and service industries. US industries that remain will be exported to countries such as Mexico where abundant slave labor is available. As we saw in 1993, this has become a fact through the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA. Unemployables in the US, in the wake of industrial destruction, will either become opium-heroin and/or cocaine addicts, or become statistics in the elimination of the “excess population” process we know of today as Global 2000.\n\n6. To encourage, and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an “art-form”, which will be widely accepted and, eventually, become quite commonplace.\n\n7. To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Pot’s genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Rome’s research foundations, and overseen by Thomas Enders, a high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia.\n\n8. To suppress all scientific development except for those deemed beneficial by the Illuminati. Especially targeted is nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Particularly hated are the fusion experiments currently being scorned and ridiculed by the Illuminati and its jackals of the press. Development of the fusion torch would blow the Illuminati’s conception of “limited natural resources” right out of the window. A fusion torch, properly used, could create unlimited and as yet untapped natural resources, even from the most ordinary substances. Fusion torch uses are legion, and would benefit mankind in a manner which, as yet, is not even remotely comprehended by the public.\n\n9. To cause, by means of A) limited wars in the advanced countries, B) by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries, the death of three billion people by the year 2050, people they call “useless eaters”. The Committee of 300 (Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced under the title “Global 2000 Report” and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter, and Edwin Muskie, then Secretary of States, for and on behalf of the US Government. Under the terms of the Global 2000 Report, the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050.\n\n10. To weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demoralize workers in the labor class by creating mass unemployment. As jobs dwindle due to the post industrial zero growth policies introduced by the Club of Rome, the report envisages demoralized and discouraged workers resorting to alcohol and drugs. The youth of the land will be encouraged by means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo, thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit. In this regard, the Committee commissioned Tavistock Institute to prepare a blueprint as to how this could be achieved. Tavistock directed Stanford Research to undertake the work under the direction of Professor Willis Harmon. This work later became known as the “Aquarian Conspiracy”.\n\n11. To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies by means of one created crisis after another and then “managing” such crises. This will confuse and demoralize the population to the extent where faced with too many choices, apathy on a massive scale will result. In the case of the US, an agency for Crisis Management is already in place. It is called the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), whose existence I first enclosed in 1980.\n\n12. To introduce new cults and continue to boost those already functioning which include rock music gangsters such as the Rolling Stones (a gangster group much favored by European Black Nobility), and all of the Tavistock-created rock groups which began with the Beatles.\n\n13. To continue to build up the cult of Christian Fundamentalism begun by the British East India Company’s servant Darby, which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist State of Israel by identifying with the Jews through the myth of “God’s chosen people”, and by donating very substantial amounts of money to what they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the furtherance of Christianity.\n\n14. To press for the spread of religious cults such as the Moslem Brotherhood, Moslem Fundamentalism, the Sikhs, and to carry out mind control experiments of the Jim Jones and “Son of Sam” type. It is worth noting that the late Khomeini was a creation of British Military Intelligence Div. 6, MI6. This detailed work spelled out the step-by-step process which the US Government implemented to put Khomeini in power.\n\n15. To export “religious liberation” ideas around the world so as to undermine all existing religions, but more especially the Christian religion. This began with the “Jesuit Liberation Theology”, that brought an end to the Somoza Family rule in Nicaragua, and which today is destroying El Salvador, now 25 years into a “civil war”. Costa Rica and Honduras are also embroiled in revolutionary activities, instigated by the Jesuits. One very active entity engaged in the so-called liberation theology, is the Communist-oriented Mary Knoll Mission. This accounts for the extensive media attention to the murder of four of Mary Knoll’s so-called nuns in El Salvador a few years ago. The four nuns were Communist subversive agents and their activities were widely documented by the Government of El Salvador. The US press and the new media refused to give any space or coverage to the mass of documentation possessed by the Salvadorian Government, which proved what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the country. Mary Knoll is in service in many countries, and placed a leading role in bringing Communism to Rhodesia, Moçambique, Angola and South Africa.\n\n16. To cause a total collapse of the world’s economies and engender total political chaos.\n\n17. To take control of all foreign and domestic policies of the US.\n\n18. To give the fullest support to supranational institutions such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank of International Settlements, the World Court and, as far as possible, make local institutions less effective, by gradually phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle of the UN.\n\n19. To penetrate and subvert all governments, and work from within them to destroy the sovereign integrity of the nations represented by them.\n\n20. To organize a world-wide terrorist apparatus [Al-Qaeda, ISIS, ISIL, etc.] and to negotiate with terrorists whenever terrorist activities take place. It will be recalled that it was Bettino Craxi, who persuaded the Italian and US Governments to negotiate with the Red Brigades kidnapers of Prime Minister Moro and General Dozier. As an aside, Dozier was placed under strict orders not to talk what happened to him. Should he ever break that silence, he will no doubt be made “a horrible example of”, in the manner in which Henry Kissinger dealt with Aldo Moro, Ali Bhutto and General Zia ul Haq.\n\n21. To take control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.","http://yournewswire.com/beyonce-illuminati-bloodlines/","1516121072.0"
"‘Smallville’ Star Confesses She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons\n‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.\n\nAccording to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.\n\nThefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.\n\nThe cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.\n\n“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”\n\nWhen these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.\n\nRaniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.\n\nIn 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.\n\nAlthough this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.\n\nA quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.\n\nAnother important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.\n\nTheir involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.\n\nAdditionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.\n\nNow that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.\n\nIn response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.\n\nFrank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.\n\n“She’s the enforcer—the brutal one. Clare’s running the [operation] now, and she’s the most ruthless of them. I’m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there’s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.” Parlato said.\n\nOf Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.\n\n“Mack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere’s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is ‘Pimp Mack,‘” Parlato said.\n\nIt is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack’s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called “Night Eyes Three.” She was just 11 years old at the time.\n\nBelow you can see the full charges against Mack and Raniere here.","https://web.archive.org/web/https://thenewlypress.com/politics/smallville-star-confesses-she-sold-children-to-rothschilds-and-clintons.html/","1525038233.0"
"Reports: US Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) Lands at Langley!\nU.S. National News\n\nDetails Category: U.S. National News Sunday, 19 November 2017 05:44\n\nUPDATED 2:23 PM EST (SEE BOTTOM) -- Reports are beginning to surface that a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) landed at Langley on Saturday.\n\nA Marine expeditionary unit (MEU, pronounced 'Mew'), is the smallest Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) in the United States Fleet Marine Force. Each MEU is an expeditionary quick reaction force, deployed and ready for immediate response to any crisis, whether it be natural disaster or combat missions.\n\nA Marine expeditionary unit is normally composed of: a reinforced Marine infantry battalion (designated as a Battalion Landing Team) as the ground combat element, a composite medium tiltrotor squadron forms the aviation combat element, a combat logistics battalion provides the logistics combat element, and a company-size command element serves as the MEU headquarters group.\n\nTroop strength is about 2,200 and usually commanded by a colonel, and is deployed from amphibious assault ships. Currently, a Marine expeditionary unit embarks Marines and equipment onto the amphibious warfare ships of an Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) which also includes escort ships and submarines to protect them from air, surface, and submarine threats. For further protection and strong air support, such an ESG is often deployed along with one or more carrier battle groups.\n\nWITNESSES\n\nAccording to persons who reside near Langley, a large contingent of Marines arrived at CIA Headquarters in tilt-rotor aircraft and when the Marines deplaned, they were armed and moved quickly into CIA Headquarters! (I did not personally witness this and am relying solely on what witnesses are telling me)\n\nThose witnesses also say that a significant number of tilt-rotor aircraft could be clearly seen circling the grounds of CIA Headquarters, parked on the grass around the building.\n\nThis is not normal.\n\nNever before has anything like this ever been seen taking place at CIA Headquarters and speculation is now running rampant as to what is actually taking place.\n\nConspiracy Theorists are claiming the President of the United States is moving to take out rogue elements in the Intelligence Community, at the request of his new CIA Director. It is rumored that these rogue elements have been undermining the Administration since before it took office last January, and may be connected to some well publicized 'incidents' which suddenly resumed taking place this year, (mass shootings / violent protests) after a brief respite once the Obama Administration left office.\n\nMoreover, there is not one word of Marines landing at Langley, appearing in _any_ US mass-media outlet.\n\nUPDATE 5:51 AM EST --\n\nThe number of SEALED INDICTMENTS presently on US District Court Dockets across the United States has reached an astonishing 1800 as of Friday, November 17. These Sealed Indictments began appearing on US District Court Dockets on October 31.\n\nThere have never been this many Sealed Indictments showing on federal court Dockets at the same time . . . ever.\n\nThe existence of so many sealed Indictments has lead others to suggest that large groups of federal officials - perhaps including elected officials - are facing mass arrest over a number of corruption-related activities such as 'pay-to-play' the UraniumOne conspiracy, Pedophile Rings and other criminal activities, and these troops may be needed to keep order once the high officials start being taken under arrest!\n\nThis is especially interesting given revelations late last week, that an FBI Informant allegedly has VIDEO of Clinton Foundation people being given suitcases full of cash from Russians, prior to the approval of the UraniumOne deal which sold twenty percent of US Uranium manufacturing to Russia's state-owned ROSATOM corporation.\n\nThe existence of video showing cash payoffs has sent a slew of people from the former Administration into fits of anxiety that their schemes are now uncovered and many of them are going to prison for what they did. Desperate people can sometimes do desperate things and if those people are high-ranking federal officials, God only knows what they might have in the works to try to save themselves.\n\nThis is a developing story. Updates will be made as information becomes available.\n\nUPDATE 9:17 PM EST --\n\nDespite actually having a personal life, and despite today being Sunday, which is family time, I have done a LOT of digging on this story. I have reached out to contacts in both the Pentagon and in several Intel Agencies and here is what I can confirm:\n\nThis story has gone viral and sadly, a number of people who copied the story, added some of their own speculation or assumptions. Some of the copies offer absolutely wild variations on the basic report above.\n\nNowhere on this web site did I even make mention of any 'coup' against the President. Those rumors came from others acting on their own.\n\nNowhere on this web site did I claim there were 2200 Marines sent to the CIA. I reported the typical size of an MEU as being typically 2200 and some readers assumed that all 2200 went to CIA.\n\nNow, about the troops. I have been told that ' a very significant number' of troops WERE sent to CIA and arrived via aircraft on Saturday, November 18. I was not told a precise number. I was not told WHY they were sent. I was not told what time they were sent.\n\nMy article above reports that a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is comprised of about 2200 Marines. That's factually accurate.\n\nBut the Ground Combat Element of an MEU is 1100 troops.\n\nThe Aviation Element consists of 12 MV-22s (Osprey) and 4 Sikorsky CH-53 'Super Stallion' helicopters.\n\nEach MV-22 carries 24 troops standard, and 32 if they cram them in.\n\nEach CH-53 carries 37 troops standard, and if the extra seats are installed 55 troops.\n\nSo going with the absolute max per aircraft, the Osprey element can carry 384 troops, and the CH-53 element 220.\n\nThat means 604 troops in a single lift. So if they were using all 1100 troops of the ground combat element that would be two trips for each aircraft.\n\nThe CIA Headquarters building is located at 1000 Colonial Farm Road in McLean, Virginia, and can be reached via George Washington Memorial Parkway.\n\nHowever, due to a need for secrecy, the complex may only be accessed by those with authorization (e.g., appropriate credentials) or by appointment; only authorized vehicles may access the private road leading to the complex from George Washington Memorial Parkway.\n\nYou cannot 'clearly see' the grounds of the installation from anywhere because the front gate is down a long, two-lane road and there's trees and man-made hills all around the perimeter of it to protect from Sniper fire coming from nearby roads.\n\n\n\nThis means that the public couldn't just wander by and start snapping pictures by the side of the road. In fact, people aren't even allowed on the private roads nearby the installation.\n\nBoth the MV-22 Osprey and Sikorsky CH-53 Super Stallion are loud when they're flying; there would be no sneaking them in.\n\nAnd it is this component that I followed-up on: Did nearby residents in McLean suddenly notice a large number of loud helicopters overhead, moving toward or from the area of the CIA. The repeated answer to that question has been 'Yes.'\n\nMany (very many) residents of McLean, VA have confirmed they found themselves hearing large numbers of loud aircraft overhead on Saturday, and that the sounds lasted more then 30 minutes!\n\nAs far as a definitive statement from any of my former colleagues . . . . NONE of them would reveal any details about whatever is going on down there. But they did confirm to me today 'something is going on.'\n\nI expect to have several additional contacts overnight and will again update this story if I am able to offer something more concise and verifiable.\n\nMy History with the FBI\n\nSeveral persons have contacted me concerning this story and asked about my former history with the FBI. There are apparently smears being postulated about me given the fact that for 15 years I worked with the FBI doing covert intelligence. Some are alleging that I may somehow still be engaged in that activity and that this story is somehow 'disinformation. Those claims are totally without merit. I think the following needs to be said:\n\nMy history is an open book now. From 1993 thru 2008 I worked with the FBI. In my final five years (2003-2008) with the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) doing National Security Intelligence. The FBI and I parted company in November 2008. They got rid of me for 'severe control problems.'\n\nYou see, the think tanks in the bureau got the idea they could lure gullible people into preparing to launch terror attacks, and guys like me could supply them with dummy explosives, dummy detonators and the like. Then, once the gullible person actually went to make his attack, the FBI could arrest him and claim they 'averted a terrorist attack. '\n\nTo me, this was entrapment. It's one thing if a guy comes to me looking for explosives and such.\n\nIt is quite another for me to go offering such things to stupid people just to build a phony case and take credit for 'averting' a terrorist attack that would have never happened had we in government not supplied the means! To me, this new program by the bureau stunk.\n\nI refused to take part in these efforts. The FBI got rid of me.\n\nAbout 7 months later, the Obama Regime arrested me for an EDITORIAL I wrote on my talk radio show web site.\n\nIn that Editorial I called three federal judges in Chicago 'Traitors to the Constitution' over a gun control ruling they made. The Editorial quoted Thomas Jefferson who said 'The tree of liberty must be replenished from time to time with the blood of Patriots and of Tyrants.' I went on to say 'These judges DESERVE to be killed. It would replenish the tree of liberty, a small price to pay to assure freedom for millions.'\n\nTwenty two days later, 14 FBI agents arrived at my house.\n\nFBI: Hi Hal. Is this still your web site?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nFBI: Did you write this?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nFBI: Hal, the US Attorney in Chicago says this is a threat and you're under arrest.\n\nTHREE TRIALS\n\nAt my FIRST trial in December, 2009, Assistant Special Agent in Charge (of the New York City FBI Division) Amy Pickett, testified in Brooklyn Federal Court that I handled National Security, Terrorism and Foreign Counter Intelligence. At the time, Alex Jones reported about me on PrisonPlanet.tv. Here's the video. It's only the first 1m 30s you need to watch - it tells it all.\n\nOthers testified that the FBI budgeted $100,000 a year for me.\n\nResult of Trial #1 --- HUNG JURY (9 voted NOT guilty)\n\nThe Obama Regime put me on trial a SECOND time in March, 2010. This time, they brought the three judges into court to testify against me. (First time in US history that 3 federal judges testified against someone).\n\nResult of Trial #2 --- HUNG JURY (10 Voted NOT guilty)\n\nBy this time, I was Bankrupt from legal fees and from being under House Arrest, prohibited from being on radio or the Internet and unable to work.\n\nUnable to pay my two lawyers, I was appointed a public defender.\n\nThe Obama Regime put me on Trial an astonishing THIRD time in August , 2010. (They usually only do that for Mafia Bosses accused of multiple murders.) The public defender rolled over and I got convicted.\n\nFederal Prison\n\nOff to federal prison I went for 33 months. And not just _any_ prison. TERRORIST PRISON at the Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana. The 'Communications Management Unit (CMU)' which is more intensely locked down and controlled than SUPERMAX!\n\nWhile all other federal prisoners get 300 minutes a month phone time, we got two, 15 minute phone calls per WEEK. And we had to sign up a week in advance, telling the prison the number we would be calling, who we would be speaking to and what language, so they could actively monitor the calls.\n\nRegular federal prisoners get a maximum of 32 hours a month visits. We got 8 hours a month.\n\nThey put me in there with El Sayyid NoSair who murdered Rabbi Meir Kahane and blew up the world trade center in 1993. He and I ate lunch together every day.\n\nThey put me in there with Muhammed Rashid, whom bombed Pan Am fight 803 and various Embassies.\n\nThey put me in there with that Somali Pirate, Musa, who hijacked the Maersk Alabama merchant vessel. You may have heard about in the Tom Hanks Movie 'Captain Philips'\n\nGo to the web site of National Public Radio. Use their search engine and conduct a search for 'CMU' and you'll find my name on the list of prisoners. The most secret prison unit in the entire United States!\n\nI was in the same unit as these killers. For writing an Editorial!\n\nHere are links to the National Public Radio stories about the CMU: https://www.npr.org/2011/03...\n\nand Prisoner List HERE: https://www.npr.org/2011/03...\n\n(Alphabetized. Search down to 'Turner, Harold Charles' )\n\nWhen I got out, three more years probation - unable to be on the net or on the radio.\n\nIf you think that I would EVER assist the federal government again, you are out of your mind. They wrecked my life. Stole my freedom and ruined my name --- because I wrote an OPINION they didn't like. THAT was the Obama regime.\n\nI returned to radio in October 2015. Had to stop for lack of funding.\n\nBrought the show back earlier this year and the ONLY thing I have going for me is that I am still in close touch with the many people in the Intelligence Community with whom I worked for years; both in the US and overseas as a fully operational Extra-Territorial operative.\n\nThanks to those long-term relationships, I get info the general public never gets near.\n\nMy credibility has proven itself over and over again. It's the only reason people listen to me and visit my site.\n\nI wouldn't DARE risk that credibility for some phony story.\n\nEver.\n\nFor anyone.\n\nI do, however, fully support President Trump, for whom I happily voted.\n\nHaving worked in covert Intelligence, I ___KNOW__ what he is actually facing in the depths of the Deep State --- and these bastards play for keeps.\n\nElements within the CIA funded and supplied weapons to ISIS inside Syria; calling them 'Freedom Fighters.' These same CIA elements funded and supplied Al-Qaida.\n\nISIS and AL-Qaida used some of that funding and some of those weapon supplies to kill innocent people, steal land, steal oil, destroy historical artifacts and create turmoil. They committed unspeakable atrocities.\n\nMaterial support of terrorism is a Felony under US federal law and now, there's a new Sheriff in town: Donald Trump.\n\nSome people inside the CIA are guilty of committing felonies and they have every reason to use every means at their disposal to prevent their lives from being destroyed over what they did. Hide files. Destroy evidence. Create crises for diversions and so on. Desperate people sometimes do desperate things.\n\nWhile I cannot even fathom doing anything to assist the federal government in any covert or overt manner, I would take a bullet to protect our President.\n\nI voted for him. I admire him. I want him to remain President and carry out the agenda he campaigned upon. I want the Illegal aliens and their kids rounded-up and deported. I want a wall built along the entire southern border. I want manufacturing jobs brought back to this country. I want an end or renegotiation to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), same with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and an end to our membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). I want radical Muslims kept out. I want our military OUT of . . . pretty much everywhere we've stuck our nose for the last two decades. I want the PEDOPHILE RINGS in Washington, DC and elsewhere arrested, prosecuted, jailed and, if possible, lawfully executed. I want an end to Affirmative Action, Minority Hiring Quotas and Contract set-asides. I want American English to be our official language. I want the Immigration Reform Act of 1964 Repealed and our immigration policy based on Merit. I want Hillary Clinton prosecuted for the E-mail deletions and mishandling of Classified Information. I want the people involved in the UraniumOne conspiracy investigated, prosecuted and jailed.\n\nIf the Deep State is actually being dealt with right now, then we the American People need to support what the President is doing. The only way the American people can know what's going on is if they are told.\n\nThat is why I went ahead with this report.\n\nI stand-by the report.\n\nMy heart is now, and has always been, with my fellow Americans.\n\nUPDATE 2:23 PM EST -- MONDAY, NOV. 20\n\nI have now spoken to almost ALL of my former colleagues in the Intelligence Community and here's what took place:\n\nYes, a group of military aircraft approached and circled the CIA Headquarters in Virginia for upwards of 30 minutes on Saturday. They did NOT land and did NOT enter CIA HQ forcibly - or otherwise.\n\nThere is apparently an ongoing and gigantic problem between the Military and the CIA insofar as the Military is engaged in implementing President Trump's policies, while elements within the CIA are still INTENTIONALLY carrying out the failed policies of the Obama regime.\n\nSpecifically, these failed Obama-era policies include supplying weapons and logistical support to so-called 'freedom fighters' inside Syria , many of whom are actually Al-Nusra, Al-Qaida and ISIS terrorists.\n\nThe support being provided by elements in the CIA is being used against certain units of the US Military who are also inside Syria.\n\nThe Military has repeatedly and strenuously told the CIA the old Obama policies must stop. The CIA failed to stop.\n\nSo someone in the Pentagon/Military . . . . no one will say who . . . made a direct show of force to the CIA on Saturday. It was, for lack of a better description, the sending of a message from the military to the CIA: knock it off.\n\nIt was done over a weekend apparently because most of the bigshots in the Pentagon are at home, and by the time they heard something was going on, it was pretty much over . . . . the aircraft returned to wherever they came from.\n\nThis is utterly unprecedented. To have one agency of the US Government make a show of force to another entity of that same government is unheard of. It smacks of a sort of internal civil war heating up inside our own government!\n\nApparently, things are quickly 'coming to a head' between competing policies and the military is tired of its people being injured or killed by the unintended consequences of the old policies and the CIA' stubborn refusal to stop backing the so-called 'Freedom Fighters' in Syria.\n\nNo one will tell me who gave the order to 'buzz' CIA HQ. No one will tell me who inside CIA is causing the trouble. But there is trouble . . . and given the activities over the weekend, one can only hope this thing goes away very quickly and quietly.\n\nIn the meantime, as far as the public is concerned: 'Nothing took place. Everything is fine. Nothing to worry about.'\n\nHELP!

"Nikki Haley Just ACCIDENTALLY Confessed To Being “Romantically Involved” With Trump!\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley is tearing into the online rumors claiming that she is having an affair with President Trump as “disgusting” and “offensive” as well an unfair evaluation of women in powerful positions.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Politico, Haley claimed that the rumors being instigated by author Micheal Wolff are “absolutely not true.”\n\nShe explained that she has never talked once to the president about her personal future and that she is never alone with Trump behind close doors.\n\n“So the idea that these things come out, that’s a problem,” she told Politico’s Women Rule podcast.\n\n“But it goes to a bigger issue that we need to always be conscious of: At every point in my life, I’ve noticed that if you speak your mind and you’re strong about it and you say what you believe, there is a small percentage of people that resent that and the way they deal with it is to try and throw arrows, lies or not.”\n\nIn his controversial book “Fire and Fury,” Wolff states that Trump had been spending “a notable amount of private time with Haley on Air Force One and was seen to be grooming her for a national political future.”\n\nWolff also informed HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” that he was “absolutely sure” Trump was involved in an affair.\n\nWolff has yet to respond to Politico’s request for a comment on Haley.\n\n“I saw this as a legislator. I saw this when I was governor. I see it now. I see them do it to other women,” she said. “And the thing is, when women work, they prioritize, they focus, and they believe if you’re gonna to something, do it right.”\n\nCOMMENT BELOW\n\nLET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK","https://web.archive.org/web/http://fullreporter.com/2018/01/28/nikki-haley-romantically-involved/","1517115600.0"
"Application for ‘March For Our Lives’ permit was made months before Parkland school shooting\nOn March 24, 2018, one month and ten days after the February 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, student-led pro-gun control “March For Our Lives” demonstrations took place across America, including in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe word “Our” in March For Our Lives refers to students.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nMarch For Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.\n\nNever Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.\n\nThe MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.\n\nPublic demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.\n\nA source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.\n\nDammegard’s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard:\n\nGood morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event. If your are requesting additional information reference this event, please follow the below steps to file your Freedom of Information Act request: https://foia-dc.gov/App/Index.aspx If your have any additional question sor concerns, please feel free in contacting me directly. Officer Scott C. Earhardt, Badge No. 2372 Homeland Security Bureau\n\nSpecial Operations Division\n\nPlanning and Logistics\n\nMetropolitan Police Department\n\n2850 New York Ave., N.E.\n\nWashington, D.C. 20002\n\n202-671-6529 (Office)\n\n202-671-6522 (Planning)\n\n202-671-6511 (Station) Scott.Earhardt@dc.gov\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the email (source: Professor James Fetzer):\n\nAccording to the PDF document, Metropolitan Police Department, Washington.D.C., Scott Earhardt indeed is a detective there. Here’s a screenshot I took from page 6 of the 65-page document:\n\nHere are some facts:\n\nThe shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018. A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD , which had not existed before February 15 . The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration “ several months prior to the actual event”.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHow can Never Again MSD apply for a permit “several months” BEFORE the group had even been formed? How can an application be made for a permit for a “March For Our Lives” demonstration “several months” BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration?\n\nSee also:\n\nUPDATE (March 31, 2018):\n\nThere are claims that the email from Officer Earhardt is bogus, and that there’s a permit application for March For Our Lives in D.C. which is dated February 20, 2018, but which is an application to the National Park Service, not Metro PD. See “The curious ever-changing dates of March For Our Lives permit application“.\n\nI, therefore, asked Professor James Fetzer for the original Earhardt email. Fetzer had obtained the screenshot of the email from Ole Dammegard, whose friend was the person who originally contacted Officer Earhardt about the permit.\n\nI just received an email from Mr. Dammegard, with an attachment of the original Earhardt email, indicating the date on which the email was sent to Dammegard’s friend who, understandably, prefers to remain anonymous.\n\nI find the above email from Officer Earhardt to be credible. I also have confidence in the integrity of Professor Fetzer and Mr. Dammegard, neither of whom profits from counterfeiting the email — which is something we can’t say about those people who instigate false-flag mass-shooting incidents like Parkland.\n\nIn the meantime, Professor Fetzer had placed a phone call to Officer Earhardt to confirm the latter’s email. When we hear from Officer Earhardt, I will update this post with that information.\n\nUpdate (April 5, 2018):\n\nOfficer Earhardt has given 4 different dates for when Metro PD received the permit application. See “The curious ever-changing dates of March For Our Lives permit application“.\n\n~Eowyn","https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2018/03/30/application-for-march-for-our-lives-permit-was-made-months-before/","1522382400.0"
"Pluto Has Been Officially Reclassified As A Planet!\nToday is a historic day—one that will bring joy to the hundreds of millions of Pluto lovers around the globe. The International Astronomical Union (IAU), the body that is responsible for naming and classifying objects in the cosmos, has just announced that Pluto has been reclassified as a major planet.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s right, the little dwarf will be rejoining the ranks of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Planet-X (the planet that will surely spell doom for all humanity).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs many of you know, in 2006, the IAU made their infamousvote, deciding to demote everyone’s favorite planet to a “dwarf planet.” Their reasoning was that too many people would confuse Pluto (the doggy of Disney fame) with Pluto (the planet, of space and stuff). Immediately after this 2006 announcement, the public exploded with outrage. There were a number of campaigns launched that were aimed at ensuring that Pluto was reinstated as a planet. These met with no success. Pluto was officially classified as a dwarf planet.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut all of that just changed, After years of deliberation, the IAU announced in a press release that they have reclassified the icy world—they upgraded Pluto back to its proper standing as a planet. “We simply underestimated the public’s attachment to Pluto.\n\nWe realized our error shortly after the decision came down to demote it,” said Dr. Amy Joggy, professor at the Institute of Planetary Studies and head of the IAU’s Planetary Classification and Experimental Nomenclature Task Force. “We didn’t think anyone would really care if a little clump of ice and rock on the outskirts of the solar system was reclassified. Clearly, we dun messed up, and that makes me super sad face.\n\nToday, we take steps to correct this most grievous of errors.\n\nIn addition to Pluto’s reclassification, Dr. Joggy has also proposed that the IAU create a new category of planet called a “hyper-planet.” These hyper-planets, according to Dr. Joggy, are like regular planets but at least two times as awesome (thanks to the fancy, fancy name).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has also been proposed that Pluto be made an honorary member of this new planetary class. “In all honesty, we feel bad for the way we treated Pluto and, more importantly, all those that cared about it so greatly- the public showed us our error. Hopefully, the new class of planet will be created without a hitch, and Pluto will be added as the first member. It’s only fair.”","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.untold-universe.org/2017/09/pluto-has-been-officially-reclassified.html/","None"
"California Christians Must Now Register Bibles As Assault Weapons\nSACRAMENTO, CA—In a blow to believers across the west coast, a new assembly bill signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown Tuesday will require Christians in the State to register Bibles of all sizes, shapes, and translation version as “assault weapons.”\n\nMany national public safety groups and political action committees praised the new law, saying that it will foster safer and more tolerant communities and save many people from having to hear words that conflict with their own worldview presuppositions.\n\n“Really, this bill should be implemented nationwide,” proclaimed Freedom From Religion Co-President Dan Barker. “California is blazing the trail for civil rights once again, as the rest of the country lags behind. There is just no place for these dangerous Assault Bibles in a civilized society. This isn’t the Wild West anymore.”\n\nAlready known to have strict laws restricting the sale and possession of assault weapons, this will expand the definition of an assault weapon to include any Bible, book quoting significant portions of the Bible, and even the dreaded high capacity Study Bibles which combine the Scripture with commentary creating an even more devastating assault of truth. The official definition of an assault weapon will now be read as any weapon that has a “pistol grip that protrudes from the bottom of the stock, a detachable magazine, or a double column alignment of dangerous words that cut and pierce, sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, bone and marrow.”\n\n“These deadly study Bibles can spit out 30 or 40 verses per page—and then explain the historical-grammatical context, and exegete the text!” Governor Brown explained to reporters after signing the bill. “It’s 2017, for goodness’ sake. Can you believe that these religious wackos think they can just open carry Bibles in open public spaces where young children and freethinkers are present?”\n\n“Spiritual people aren’t having their rights taken away. That’s just the right wing alarmists trying to scare you. New Age books will still be readily available in book retailers across the Golden State,” he added.","http://babylonbee.com/news/california-christians-must-now-register-bibles-assault-weapons/","1496168675.0"
"Smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018\nA ban has been applied since last month. It is now illegal for anyone to smoke in their car as long as there are children in the vehicle.\n\nWhether you have the car door open or the aircon on, the new rule still applies. The new law aims to try and reduce the number of people who smoke and to protect children.\n\nThe law became effective on January 30, 2018. It is meant is to protect children from secondhand smoking and violating this law could result in a fine of up to $100.\n\nThe Department of Health stated that when a child breathes in secondhand smoke, they breathe in thousands of chemicals, just like the actual smoker. This puts the child at risk of serious conditions including cancer, bronchitis, and pneumonia.\n\nSecondhand smoke can also worsen asthma. This new law applies to any private vehicle that is completely enclosed or partly enclosed by a roof.\n\nIt applies even if people have the windows or sunroof open. It also applies to you if you have the air-conditioning on, or if they are sitting in a parked car with the door open.\n\nThe federal agency Housing and Urban Development are rolling out its nationwide ban on smoking in public housing. This is just a few years after many states outlawed smoking in beaches and public parks.\n\nThe law makes people wonder if the complete prohibition of tobacco smoking might be close. Ronald Bayer, co-director of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, spoke to Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\n“In America, it’s very difficult to be simply paternalistic.”\n\nRonald Bayer, Love This Pic, February 3, 2018\n\nHe told the site that American values of privacy and freedom made it very difficult to prohibit anything as mainstream as tobacco. The old ‘nanny state’ argument apparently reared its head every time the argument came up.\n\nMillions of people are still addicted to cigarettes and there is also the fear that a ban would bring about a black market. The market would be similar to what exists with illegal drugs or what happened with alcohol during Prohibition.\n\nBayer suggested that one way to help people quit would be by tackling the problem from the supply side. “I think we would do much better to think about reducing the nicotine content, so that the addictive quality of cigarettes wasn’t as severe, and make quitting easier,” he said.\n\nIn 2008, the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control established a method called MPOWER. The method aims to end the ‘global tobacco epidemic,’ which kills over 7 million people each year.\n\nThe plan is to not ban it all at once, but instead to monitor usage and prevention, protecting citizens from second-hand smoke. The WHO also wished to offer people ways to help them quit.\n\nThey want to keep warning people of the dangers of smoking, enforcing bans on advertising, and raising taxes on tobacco products.","https://web.archive.org/web/https://es.amomama.com/62933-smoking-cars-children-illegal-starting-j.html/","None"
"Las Vegas: Video Confirms Multiple Shooters, Co-ordinated Attack\nThe mainstream media narrative about the Las Vegas shooting has been debunked by two explosive videos provided to Your News Wire that confirm there were multiple shooters involved in a co-ordinated attack.\n\nBoth videos show gunfire originating from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, much lower than the 32nd floor, where the mainstream media is claiming Stephen Paddock, a “lone wolf”, fired on the crowd using an automatic weapon.\n\nSHOTS FIRED ON 4TH FLOOR You can clearly see shots being fired from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay. #LasVegasShooting Posted by The People's Voice on Monday, October 2, 2017\n\nThe mainstream media narrative regarding Paddock’s motives have also been debunked by FBI sources who reportedly claimed the shooter has links to Antifa as well as ISIS. But mainstream media is actively covering up the information, claiming Paddock had “no political or religious affiliations or interests.”\n\nThe fact is the Las Vegas shooting was clearly an co-ordinated false flag attack, orchestrated by Paddock as well as at least one other as yet unidentified gunman operating from the fourth floor of the hotel. The mass shooting and scores of dead will be used by the elite to further their nefarious agenda.\n\n[RELATED – Bellagio Hotel Guests And Staff Confirm Multiple Shooters]\n\nAnybody who looks into the information available to them on the internet will arrive at the same conclusion. Unfortunately anybody who relies on mainstream media for their information will be force-fed a very different conclusion.\n\nSECOND LAS VEGAS SHOOTER More evidence of a second shooter at the 4th floor window of the Mandalay Bay hotel. #LasVegasShooting Posted by The People's Voice on Monday, October 2, 2017\n\nThe questions must be asked: why is the mainstream media covering for a mass murderer? Why are they attempting to rewrite his past and erase his political affiliations?\n\nThe answers are simple. The corporate media, controlled by a small, elite oligarchy, is operating on behalf of the New World Order, attempting to mislead the public into believing their enemies are their friends, and their friends are their enemies.\n\n[RELATED – Hotel Guest Next Door To Shooter Saw ‘Multiple Gunmen’]\n\nIt doesn’t suit the mainstream media’s agenda to have an Antifa member responsible for the worst mass shooting in American history. They are actively engaged in covering up this fact up so they can continue pushing the New World Order’s sick and twisted agenda.\n\nStephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, was an Antifa member who carried out the worst mass shooting in American history in order to create further division in American society, push the country towards civil war, and further the agenda of the elites.\n\nOfficial Antifa facebook page, Antifa Melbourne, congratulated Stephen Paddock after the bloodiest mass shooting in America’s history, before deleting the post after a torrent of criticism.\n\nThere is an active campaign to sow division and create chaos in the United States. Organized groups are working on behalf of global organizations with the most nefarious of goals. We need to wake up and stop believing everything fed to us by the mainstream media.

"Broward County Sheriff Who Exposed Parkland Shooting Found Dead – Media Blackout\nA Broward County Sheriff Deputy who dared to question the official narrative around the Parkland shooting has been found dead under suspicious circumstances.\n\nOn April 1, Jason Fitzsimon was found dead on his sofa. According to police, the 42-year-old had been in excellent health prior to his untimely death.\n\nMemoryholeblog.org reports: reports: Deputy Fitzsimons wasn’t just any law enforcement officer. Unlike many of his peers, he took to social media to question the potential agenda behind the February 14 Marjory Stoneman High School mass shooting, suggesting that the event was being used to promote the Democratic Party’s gun control platform in anticipation of the 2018 midterm elections. And recent personnel decisions involving public officials indicate (e.g. here and here), an unwritten law of taxpayer-funded institutions is that employees disavow and steer clear of “conspiracy theories” that may call their superiors motives into question.\n\nOne post found on Fitzsimon’s Facebook page depicts the Parkland massacre’s main spokesperson, David Hogg, in National Socialist regalia, with the caption, “We will March Until We Disarm Every American.”\n\nFitzsimons Facebook page has since been “scrubbed” of any 2018 posts, which would of course include those that may be calling the the Parkland shooting or its aftermath into question.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Deputy Fitzsimon’s death are sketchy. The official cause has been attributed to cancer, yet this is contradicted by an obituary found at obittree.com, stating that he “died unexpectedly.” The “died unexpectedly” phrase is one morticians and/or loved ones sometimes employ when for one reason or another they are reluctant to disclose the true cause of death, as in the case of a suicide.\n\nYet as the above obituary makes clear, Fitzsimons does not seem as if he would have been a likely suicide candidate. The law enforcement officer “lived life to the fullest and enjoyed spending time loving on his many friends [sic],”the document reads. Fitzsimons was also the life of the party, according to the obituary’s author(s). “He dreamed to one day be Batman or Kenny Chesney, and you could often find him singing at a local karaoke night or taking selfies while under the disguise of the caped crusader.” Further, the deceased also had a spiritual devotion “in his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”\n\nIf Fitzsimons in fact died of cancer, the onset must have been extremely sudden. Neither the obituary nor accompanying memorials reference any struggle with the disease, but instead point to his inspiring presence while expressing astonishment at the abruptness of his passing.\n\nAside from numerous friends attesting to his warm disposition in their memorials, Deputy Fitzsimons appeared to be in excellent health, as various photos suggest.\n\nFollowing the December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook School massacre numerous law enforcement officers with intimate knowledge of the event’s investigation either retired or died unexpectedly. These included Connecticut State Police Major William Podgorski, who passed on following “a brief undisclosed illness.”\n\nAs Sandy Hook researcher Tony Mead observed in 2014,\n\nFrom Douglas Cottle, who died Sept 29, 2012, at age 62 to Michael Bellmore, who died May 3, 2014 at age 27, more questions than answers seem to arise. The Connecticut State Police Commander, the Connecticut State Police Commissioner, the Western Connecticut State Police Commander as well as the Connecticut State Medical Examiner have all been eliminated from the story either by retiring or death. What better way to cover up any possibility of ever disclosing the truth ? What better way to perpetuate conspiracy theories ?\n\nThose who received word via Twitter of Fitzsimon’s untimely death have expressed similar doubt and suspicion on the vague and unusual circumstances.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of Deputy Jason Fitzsimons today. Deputy Fitzsimons began his career with the agency In 2008. During this time he served with the North Lauderdale and Pompano Beach Districts. Our thoughts and prayers are with with his family. pic.twitter.com/vBmf50LtfJ — Broward Sheriff (@browardsheriff) April 2, 2018\n\nAs is suggested in the aftermath of other recent mass shooting events, Fitzsimons simply may have possessed too much information, was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and/or asking sensitive questions of his peers and superiors on the specifics of the Parkland shooting. It is beyond dispute that the sheriff’s deputy had become uncomfortably outspoken on the February 14 event.\n\nThe record reflects that Deputy Fitzsimons was a wonderful individual and friend who cared about “truth” and the US Constitution. Perhaps these concerns are no longer desired by the management of certain policing agencies. There is indeed ample room for suspicion.","http://yournewswire.com/broward-county-sheriff-parkland-shooting-found-dead/","1523581335.0"

"Hotel Worker Vanishes After Saying Stephen Paddock 'Didn't Have Many Bags'\nHotel Worker Vanishes After Saying Stephen Paddock 'Didn't Have Many Bags'\n\nValet said suspected shooter was a 'normal guy' - social media accounts scrubbed\n\n© Neon Nettle Hotel worker Chad Nishimura vanished after stating Paddock didn't have many bags\n\nA valet worker from the Mandalay Bay hotel, who parked the suspected Las Vegas shooting gunman's car, has mysteriously vanished after giving an interview saying Stephen Paddock was a 'normal guy' who 'didn't have many bags'. Chad Nishimura gave a statement to Moanike’ala Nabarro, a reporter for Hawaiian ABC affiliate, KITV4 News. The article has now been deleted from the KITV4 News website after it appeared to go against the 'official' mainstream media narrative that 'lone wolf' gunman Paddock had managed to get enough guns for a small army into his hotel room completely undetected. The most disturbing part though is that Hawaii native Nishimura has completely vanished since the report was published, with all of his social media accounts being scrubbed from the internet. Friends and colleagues say he has been 'totally unreachable for days' since shortly after the horrific massacre that left 59 dead and hundreds more injured.\n\nThe article offered a refreshing perspective from someone who had met and spoken to Paddock shortly before the attack took place and gave an entirely different version of the man who 'acted alone' that is being reported by the MSM. Nishimura told the ABC affiliate that Paddock 'seemed normal' and that he 'didn’t have any bags with him upon arrival.' Perhaps you could explain away the removal of the article as being down to higher-ups at ABC taking issue with a report that conflicts with the narrative they are pushing on the public, but why would Chad Nishimura also disappear and delete all of his social media accounts? Could this report have put the whole 'lone wolf' story in jeopardy or did he know something else that he may have also gone public with? People who realized the original article had been deleted have been Tweeting to the network that published the report, KITV4 News, to try and get answers but have had no response.\n\n@KITV4 why did you delete the story about the shooters valet?????? — Radical Larry™ (@McMoody17) October 6, 2017\n\n4chan users have archived the full story once it became apparent that the reports regarding this encounter were being erased from the internet. Twitter users also tried to reach out to Nabarro regarding the retraction of her story, however, there has been no response as of yet. Another curious anecdote of this whole story is that the bio for the KITV4 reporter says that she is a weather reporter, but why would a weather reporter report on such a sensitive story as this? Here is the full report as it was originally published: A Kamehameha graduate working as a valet at the Mandalay Bay Resort said he parked the shooter's car on Saturday. The gunman, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, checked his car into the hotel on Saturday morning.\n\nValet Chad Nishimura, who is from Mililani, said he spoke briefly with Paddock. 'Just in shock, really. It's scary to know that I was close to someone that was that dangerous. I would've never thought. He seemed like a normal guy. When he came in, nothing too weird about him. He didn't have any crazy bags with him that I can remember. We are a convention hotel so we have a bunch of people that have boxes and multiple carts worth of stuff. There's nothing weird that I can remember,' Nishimura said. Nishimura and hundreds of employees at Mandalay Bay are cooperating with FBI agents as investigations continue. A number of people from Hawaii were at Sunday night's concert or nearby. Social media helped connect family and friends worried about their loved ones. Tara Spangler, originally from Pa'ia Maui, was working close to the concert venue, at the Hooter's Casino.\n\nShe posted on her Facebook page that she was safe but said shooting victims fleeing the concert, swarmed into the casino. 'You can just see towels of blood everywhere and people walking past and they have like blood spots on their shirts and even on their face. I remember asking a girl, 'Hey are you OK?'

"BREAKING! Terrorist Attacked Trumps At Mar A Lago\n2.2k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nSince President Trump has been in office, the left has been in an uproar and doing their best to create as much civil unrest as possible. These angry leftists in their rage over the fact that Trump trounced Hillary in the 2016 presidential election have been fanning the flames of division in our country and promoting violence against the president. Over the last year, several liberal Democrat politicians and unhinged Hillary Clinton fanatics have made explicit death threats against President Trump which has kept the Secret Service on high alert. Now, over this holiday weekend, President Trump and his family had an urgent situation unfold that had the police rushing to the scene, and has everyone wondering when the violence will end?\n\nThere was a time in our nation’s history that no matter who won the presidential election, the American people and the loser of the election would band together behind the elected president for the good of the nation. However, those days seem far behind after the last eight years of Barack Obama and his divisive nature that has thrust our country into constant turmoil. Now, instead of those in the Democrat party cheering on President Trump to ensure that he does a job well done for the American people, they have been actively doing their best to sabotage his presidency. For instance, over the last year, the left has been doing whatever they can to oust Trump from office with their phony Russian collusion story, and since that has not worked the way, they had hoped they are turning to threats of physical violence.\n\nThreats of violence toward President Trump is not anything new in this “brave new world” of politics, in fact just earlier last month, Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi promoted acts of violence against Trump during a town hall meeting he attended. Then last year, Missouri Democratic State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal posted on Facebook that she hoped that President Trump was assassinated, are you starting to notice a pattern here?\n\nSo, it should come as no surprise that civilians in the country would attack Trump, his family, and now his property, which is what happened over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nHere is more from Local 10 News:\n\n“Someone in West Palm Beach, Florida, took the term “paint the town red” a bit too literal on Saturday night.\n\nThe entrance to Trump International Golf Club, the president’s course du jour while at the so-called Winter White House in Mar-a-Lago, had new decoration on Saturday evening in the form of red paint splattered all over one of the entrance signs.\n\nThe red paint was tossed haphazardly on the left entrance with a can of paint visible on the ground. It’s unclear exactly when the vandalism happened.\n\nTwo vans from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Department were on scene investigating the apparent vandalism Saturday at about 10 p.m.\n\nNeither the U.S. Secret Service nor the sheriff’s department responded to inquiries from ABC NewsSaturday night.\n\nDonald Trump spent Saturday at Trump International Golf Club, according to the Tampa Bay Times, though it’s not clear if he was on the course. Trump was at the club on Friday as well. The president is usually secretive about whether he actually hits the links or not.\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity and PGA golfer Dustin Johnson spent time with Trump at the golf club on Saturday as well, according to Palm Beach Post reporter George Bennett. Donald Trump Jr. shared a photo on Instagram of his daughter Kai with Johnson, the current world No. 1 player, and 2016 U.S. opener winner, on the course.\n\nIt’s not clear whether any of the Trumps were at the club when the vandalism occurred.\n\nTrump opened the golf club in 1999, the first of what is now many courses in his portfolio. According to ABC News’ analysis of public records of Trump’s schedule, the president spent 109 days at one of his properties in his first year in office.\n\nThe president’s Mar-a-Lago estate is just a 15-minute drive from Trump International.”\n\nEntrance to Trump International Golf Club in Florida splattered with red paint https://t.co/tEACIbJq61 pic.twitter.com/q3yRcAnWt2 — The Hill (@thehill) April 1, 2018\n\nNow, while this attack on Trump’s property is disgusting, it is not the first time it has been done. Earlier last year, another of Trump’s hotels were vandalized when a light was projected onto the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, several anti-Trump messages.\n\nHere is more from Business Insider:\n\n“Several messages were displayed in a bluish light. The Washington Post reported that the words “PAY TRUMP BRIBES HERE” appeared above the entrance to the building, along with an arrow pointing toward the entrance of the hotel.\n\nAnother projection read, “EMOLUMENTS WELCOME” — an apparent reference to the emoluments clause that became a point of contention amid arguments about Trump’s financial conflicts of interest in the early days of his presidency. The “emoluments” message was displayed over a backdrop of Turkey’s flag.”\n\nWhether or not you agree with the president in office there is a proper way to air your grievances but to destroy private property is not the way. One can only hope that the people who did this to Trump’s resort will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to send a clear message to others who may think this behavior is acceptable when it most certainly isn’t.\n\nH/T [ABC News Go]","https://web.archive.org/web/https://daily-vine.com/breaking-terrorist-attacked-trumps-at-mar-a-lago-police-on-scene/","1522620640.0"
"Schiff’s Hatred For Americans Makes Sense When You Consider His Sister Is Married To George Soro’s Son\nAdam Schiff, who fought last week’s release of the memo, has described it as a misleading, inaccurate attempt to discredit the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into the Trump campaign’s false ties to Russia. He has emerged as a visible nemesis of Americans, appearing almost daily on television to discuss the various fake investigations of President Trump.\n\n“Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper!,” President Trump tweeted, referring to former James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director; Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia; John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director; and James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence. “Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!”\n\nCoincidentally, Adam Schiff’s sister is the estranged wife of globalist George Soro’s son.\n\nBillionaire George Soros’s son Robert and his estranged wife Melissa Schiff are at risk of forfeiting their entire art collection — including pieces by Jeff Koons and Christopher Wool — if they can’t agree on its value, his lawyer said.\n\nThe former couple were in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday for the opening day of their $350 million divorce trial.\n\nSoros’ attorney, Alan Feigenbaum, said their prenuptial agreement states that if “the parties cannot agree on a value…property should be sold.”\n\nBut Schiff’s lawyer, Bernard Clair, disputed that interpretation. He argued that an appeals court ruled in April that “the prenup does not address the disposition of marital art.”\n\nSoros, who until recently ran his father’s $28 billion investment management firm, wants to sell off their collection, while Schiff wants to keep selected pieces.\n\nThey’re also fighting over a $5.85 million Rhinebeck farm, which Schiff testified that she “loves more than anything.”\n\nSoros filed for divorce from his wife of 22 years in 2014 — after an affair with a nude model.","http://50statereport.com/schiffs-hatred-for-americans-makes-sense-when-you-consider-his-sister-is-married-to-george-soros-son/","None"
"NPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton ‘Completely Fake’ – She Lost Popular Vote\nA study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin.\n\nA study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million “registered voters”.\n\nAccording to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and “multiple state” voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race.\n\nInfowars.com reports:\n\n“A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,” NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.\n\nAnd many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that there’s likely more dead and invalid voters than before.\n\n“…The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,” NPR added.\n\nThat’s because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.\n\nUnder the “catch and release” immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.\n\nClinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump – and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.\n\nA portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and it’s worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.\n\nThat said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president.\n\nWithout the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.\n\nYet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.\n\nHowever, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.","https://yournewswire.com/npr-25-million-fake-clinton-votes/","1485669228.0"
"Mariah Carey records shock cover of Dead Kennedy’s ‘Nazi Punks Fuck Off’ in support of ANTIFA\nBorn again Christian pop singer and self styled “voice of the MTV generation” Mariah Carey, has sent shock waves through tin pan alley with the announcement that she has recorded a cover of the Dead Kennedy’s “Nazi Punks Fuck Off” to be released as a single and with the proceeds to be donated to US anti Fascist action group ANTIFA.\n\nThe shock release is slated to be available as MP3 and Flac downloads as well as CD single and a strictly limited edition vinyl double single in red vinyl featuring bonus covers of “California Über Alles” and “Too Drunk to Fuck”.\n\nA spokesman for Ms Carey confirmed that the singer, who is descended from immigrants of mixed African American, Venezuelan and Irish descent had been particularly affected by coverage of the recent anti white supremacist protests in Charlottesville and felt obliged to speak out.\n\n“Mariah may be best known for producing some of the most dismally bland commercial music of the past two decades and for dating obscenely rich men but she feels this is the time to make a break with the past and embark on a new stage in her career,” he explained. The spokesman confirmed that plans are far advanced for Carey to do a nationwide tour of small club venues with a four piece backing band. “We can’t confirm the line up yet but East Bay Ray has said he’s up for it, and (Ex Hüsker Dü guitarist) Bob Mould is interested,” he added.\n\nHe also declined to confirm rumours that Carey had recorded a version of the Toy Dolls take on the classic childen’s song “Nellie the Elephant”, noted for its raucus chorus of “TRUMP ! TRUMP ! TRUMP!” to be released the moment the already disgraced president is impeached.\n\nNews of the shock release has been taken by many to confirm long standing rumours that Carey had been secretly dating former Kennedy’s front man Eric Boucher, better known under his stage name Jello Biafra.\n\nThe former singer turned spoken word artist and outspoken atheist represents a marked contrast to Ms Carey’s previous paramours who include former husbands; billionaire head of Sony Music, Tommy Mottola and TV presenter and impresario Nick Canon. Carey also dated Australian multi Billionaire and cricket fan James Packer.\n\nHowever the pair famously broke off their engagement following a bitter argument over a contested LBW decision in the second test of the 2016 West Indies tour of Australia.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2017/08/20/mariah-carey-records-shock-cover-of-dead-kennedys-nazi-punks-fuck-off-in-support-of-antifa/amp/#/","1503201600.0"
"Muslim Doctor Refuses To Save A Christian Man’s Life On Flight From New York To Las Vegas\nDr. Jaleel Kohmeni raised his hand when the flight attendant on Delta flight 6978 from New York to Las Vegas asked if there was a doctor on board. He told the attendant that he wasn’t an American and that he preferred another doctor help if possible. Unfortunately, he was the man’s only hope.\n\nAs he approached, he could see that the man was barely managing to breathe and going in and out of consciousness.

"Planned Parenthood Teams up with Satanists to Promote Abortion in Missouri\nMissouri has reportedly doubled its abortion capacity this year “thanks to the Satanic Temple and Planned Parenthood,” who have worked in tandem to fight the state’s restrictions on abortion.\n\nWith some of the most clearly defined regulations on abortion in the nation, Missouri had managed to lower the number of abortion facilities to a single clinic, but a second Missouri clinic opened its doors recently and two others plan on following soon.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has battled against state regulations requiring abortion clinics to meet the same surgical center standards as full hospitals and for their doctors to have hospital privileges, and in April a federal court sided with the abortion giant.\n\nU.S. District Judge Howard Sachs granted a preliminary injunction invalidating requirements for the state’s abortion clinics to meet standards for surgical centers and for their doctors to have hospital privileges, citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down similar restrictions in Texas, which deemed those laws unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n“Missouri has not complied with that decision,” Sachs, of the Western District of Missouri in Kansas City, wrote.\n\nShortly afterward, Planned Parenthood expressed its intention to expand its abortion services in the state. On Monday, Planned Parenthood Great Plains announced plans to offer abortion services at two more clinics in Missouri, including its midtown Kansas City clinic, which now offers medication abortion services.\n\nThe Satanic Temple has often lent its muscle to pro-abortion efforts alongside Planned Parenthood, and in this case has pressured Missouri legislators and worked through the courts to bring about a relaxing of abortion restrictions, according to reports. One of the Temple’s fundamental tenets is that “One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.”\n\nOn Monday, the Satanic Temple argued in a Missouri court that the state’s abortion restrictions violate members’ rights to free religious practice. The organization challenged two Missouri laws: one that requires patients to look at anti-abortion literature and another that obliges them to wait 72 hours between their initial consultations and second appointments for their abortions.\n\nSatanic Temple members have argued that their religion prizes rational, independent thought and that forcing Satanists to read anti-abortion pamphlets and “consider a religious proposition with which they do not agree” during the 72-hour waiting period constitutes a violation of their beliefs.\n\nFor years the Satanic Temple has been involved with lawsuits in Missouri fighting abortion regulations. The group also attempted to procure a religious waiver for a female Satanist who sought to circumvent the 72-hour requirement under pretense that it violated her religion. A judge eventually threw out the case because the woman was no longer pregnant.\n\nThe Satanic Temple has been on the forefront of the fight to protect and extend abortion rights throughout the nation, and in 2015 set up a crowdfunding website with Indiegogo “to challenge arbitrary, insulting abortion regulations,” especially the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n\nIts website states:\n\nThe Satanic Temple (TST) supports personal choice in the context of abortion and, as part of a multi-faceted Women’s Rights campaign, TST is offering religious exemptions from arbitrary, insulting, and outright harmful anti-abortion legislation that has been steadily encroaching across the nation.\n\nAs an interesting aside, Satanism has a millennial history of association with child sacrifice, which makes the Temple’s financial and moral support of abortion a natural activity for the sect. The Israelites struggled against the worship of Baal, another name for the Phoenician god Moloch, who demanded child sacrifices of his followers and was associated with the devil. The prophet Jeremiah spoke explicitly of the sacrifice of children to Baal, warning his readers that God finds such behavior abhorrent.\n\nBaal was often identified with Satan, especially in the form of “Beezebul” (Lord Baal), the prince of demons, which literally meant the “Lord of the Flies.” Jesus Christ was accused of obtaining powers for his miracles from “Beelzebul,” whom he identified as Satan.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

"Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again “Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More”\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn\n\nLady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame. In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.\n\n“It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”\n\nAsked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.\n\n“So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”\n\n“Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded.","http://therightists.com/lady-gaga-reveals-plan-to-cover-her-face-again-until-trump-gets-fired-from-office-and-i-feel-free-once-more/","None"

"Liberals at UT Austin Want Masculinity Designated as a Mental Illness\nThe insane, mentally deranged liberals at the University of Texas now want masculinity to be designated as a mental illness.\n\nYou know, there was once a day when things like this were the stuff of satire, but today this garbage is nothing short of mainstream, every day liberalism.\n\nIt would make the job of The Onion harder these days… you know, if The Onion ever made fun of anything on the left, that is. But now we’ve reached peak lunacy masquerading as sentient thought by liberals and treated as legitimate by the illiterati in the media and our system of miseducation.\n\nThis foolishness comes from the Counseling and Mental Health Center at the University of Texas at Austin. If you don’t know, the City of Austin is one of the most liberal quarters of the otherwise deeply red Lone Star State.\n\nThis purported “counseling” department at the university started a program to “help” male students “take control over their gender identity and develop a healthy sense of masculinity,” PJMedia reported.\n\nThe creators of this foolish left-wing circlejerk claim that it is that danged old “restrictive masculinity” that forces men to “act like a man” and that encourages men to be “too masculine.” This program wants people to stop saying men should be a “breadwinner” or that they should strive for success in their careers. Men need to be wimpy, subservient, spineless, and unable to make a decision without a woman to tell them how to think and what to do.\n\nIt goes on:\n\nThough you might enjoy “taking care of people” or being “active,” MasculinUT warns that many of these attributes are actually dangerous, claiming that “traditional ideas of masculinity place men into rigid (or restrictive) boxes [which]… prevent them from developing their emotional maturity.” “If you are a male student at UT reading this right now, we hope that learning about this helps you not to feel guilty about having participated in these definitions of masculinity, and instead feel empowered to break the cycle!” the program offers.\n\nNaturally, what the creators of the program are trying to get across to the men they are trying to “counsel” is that being masculine is “dangerous” to everyone, male and female alike.\n\nThe school is also insisting that by the mere misfortune of being born a man invariably creates “rape culture,” so, the school aims to neuter men and eliminate any vestige of being a man.\n\nPJMedia adds:\n\nThere is no evidence that masculinity itself contributes to violence. Universities that run similar programs, such as UNC-Chapel Hill and Northwestern, have admitted that their programming isn’t supported by any evidence.\n\nIndeed, Campus Reform found a list of other schools creating programs aimed at erasing men.\n\nA Campus Reform analysis identified five currently-active men’s programs on American college campuses. These programs pledge to teach men to combat issues such as “toxic masculinity,” “rape culture,” and “violence against women.” These five programs include NU Men at Northwestern University, Duke University’s Men’s Project, the Men’s Project at the University of Connecticut, the Men’s Project at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and the Missouri State University Men Addressing Social Construction program.\n\nIn any case, the Texas university says it is currently working to fully staff this outrageous attack on men.\n\nAmusingly, after PJMedia published its story, the university tried to disavow the radical notions the program is set to force upon its victims. The university put a distressed disclaimer on the program’s webpage.\n\n“The MasculinUT program does not treat masculinity as a ‘mental health issue,’ and any such statements are simply not accurate,” the left-wingers insisted. “It was established to bring more men to the table to address interpersonal violence, sexual assault and other issues.”\n\nIndeed, the disclaimer admits that it is treating being a man as the sole cause of sexual assault.\n\nLike other UT programs related to sexual assault and interpersonal violence, MasculinUT is housed administratively in the university’s Counseling and Mental Health Center. Its goals include helping men explore ways to reduce sexual violence, helping students take responsibility for their actions, and fostering healthier relationships on campus and beyond.\n\nBy “helping men explore ways to reduce sexual violence” they mean “helping men eliminate their masculinity.”\n\nAs I noted, if I was writing this ten years ago everyone would assume that I was merely trying to defame good liberals with an outrageous piece of satire.\n\nBefore you think this is the only mentally ill attack on logic and good sense, last year liberals were running around scolding people for calling breastfeeding “natural.”\n\nWhy were liberals trying to discourage people from calling breastfeeding “natural”? Because it might upset gays and transgenders who can’t breastfeed.\n\nIn fact, the medical journal Pediatrics said that it is actually “unethical” to describe breastfeeding as “natural.”\n\nNow, catch this idiotic, liberal, university-speak:\n\n“Coupling nature with motherhood,” says the study, “can inadvertently support biologically deterministic arguments about the roles of men and women in the family (for example, that women should be the primary caretaker.”\n\nOnce again we see the left bowing to their politically correct lunacy instead of real science.\n\nBut, reality doesn’t much matter to liberals.","https://constitution.com/liberals-at-ut-austin-want-masculinity-designated-as-a-mental-illness/","1525100480.0"
"Obama’s Private ‘Security’ Company Sets Up MASSIVE Camps Outside 3 Major Cities\n“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:\n\nAlong with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.\n\nHow embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.\n\nThe extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.\n\nThis is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.americanewsupdates.me/2018/04/obamas-private-security-company-sets-up.html/","None"
"Cast of ‘Black Panther’ Added to FBI Watch List\nIn response to a record-breaking premiere weekend, the FBI has added the cast of Black Panther to its domestic terror organizations watch list.\n\n“It is our understanding that the cast of this film has raised over $235 million for their efforts to spread their black extremist message,” said FBI director Christopher Wray. “That is not something that we can tolerate.”\n\nSources report that A-list celebrities Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong’o have been added to the watch list, with little justification other than seeming “suspicious.”\n\n“It’s an imperfect process,” says one source within the FBI. “But if anything uses the words ‘black’ and ‘panther’ we’re all over it.”\n\nBoth members of the cast and members of the actual Black Panthers have expressed confusion at the maneuver.\n\n“I don’t understand why I’ve been put on a watch list,” said Lupita Nyong’o, who played Nakia. “It has nothing to do with the Black Panther Party. Has anyone at the FBI even seen it?”\n\n“I’m an actor, not an actual Black Panther,” said Michael B. Jordan, who has witnessed several unmarked vehicles parked outside of his residence in Sherman Oaks, CA. “With all due respect, the FBI is wildin’. Did they even see the movie?”\n\n“As inhumane and biased as the FBI’s actions toward the BPP have been in the past, this is a grave injustice,” added playwright, professor, and former Black Panther Jamal Joseph. “It just seems like they are being watched as a result of our government’s ongoing campaign against anyone who celebrates blackness. Also, has anyone at the FBI seen the film?”\n\nBut the FBI has remained firm in their stance.\n\n“The Bureau will not bend to the will of those who choose to be linked to domestic terrorist organizations,” iterated Michael P. Kortan. “We have an obligation to monitor those individuals and maintain the safety of our great country.”\n\nHe added: “I haven’t seen the film yet but it looks fucking awesome.”","http://reductress.com/post/cast-of-black-panther-added-to-fbi-watch-list/","None"

He posted statements such as “It’s time to destroy Trump and Co.” and that Scalise should “lose his job.”\n\nHe “liked” the Southern Poverty Law Center, which itself has been linked to domestic terror and once put Ben Carson on its list of “haters.”\n\nGet the Whistleblower Magazine’s revelations about the SPLC, in its March 2015 edition of “The Hate Racket,” the complete story of how one group fools government into equating Christians and conservatives with Klansmen and Nazis – and rakes in millions doing it.\n\nSPLC’s past targeting of FRC was cited in court as the impetus for an attack on the Christian organization’s Washington, D.C., headquarters.\n\nThe legal team at Liberty Counsel, criticizing SPLC for “falsely and recklessly labeling Christian ministries as ‘hate groups,'” noted SPLC is “responsible for the first conviction of a man who intended to commit mass murder targeted against a policy organization in Washington, D.C.”\n\n“On August 15, 2012, Floyd Corkins went to the Family Research Council with a gun and a bag filled with ammunition and Chick-fil-A sandwiches. His stated purpose was to kill as many employees of the Family Research Council as possible and then to smear Chick-fil-A sandwiches in their faces (because the founder of the food chain said he believed in marriage as a man and a woman). Fortunately, Mr. Corkins was stopped by the security guard, who was shot in the process. Corkins is now serving time in prison. Mr. Corkins admitted to the court that he learned of the Family Research Council by reading the SPLC’s hate map.”\n\nWND reported a video showed Corkins entering the FRC offices and confronting Leo Johnson.\n\nCorkins later was sentenced to prison for domestic terrorism. It was during an interview with FBI officers that Corkins named SPLC as his source of information.\n\nCentral to the case, according to the government’s document, was that Corkins “had identified the FRC as an anti-gay organization on the Southern Poverty Law Center website.”\n\nFRC officials repeatedly have explained that they adhere to a biblical perspective on homosexuality but are not “anti-gay.”\n\nSPLC also exhibited behavior so egregious that it was reprimanded by the far-left administration of Barack Obama.\n\nJudicial Watch, citing a letter to Michael M. Hethmon, senior counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, and others, said the DOJ reprimand came in 2016 but was “kept quiet at the agency’s request.”\n\n“[It] involves the SPLC’s atrocious behavior during immigration court proceedings. Two groups that oppose illegal immigration, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), were the target of personal, baseless and below-the-belt attacks from SPLC attorneys during official immigration court proceedings. The SPLC filed a motion attacking and defaming the two respected nonprofits by describing them as ‘white supremacist,’ ‘eugenicist,’ ‘anti-Semitic,’ and ‘anti-Catholic.’ In its reprimand the DOJ says it is troubled by the conduct of SPLC lawyer Christopher Strawn and that his conduct ‘overstepped the bounds of zealous advocacy and was unprofessional.’ Furthermore, SPLC made ‘uncivil comments that disparaged FAIR and its staff,’ the rebuke states, adding that the language constitutes frivolous behavior and doesn’t aid in the administration of justice,” Judicial Watch explained.\n\n“The Obama administration kept the reprimand confidential and asked FAIR and IRLI to keep it under wraps. In the meantime, SPLC continues to publicly trash the groups and escalate attacks against them by putting them on the official hate list. The executive director and general counsel of IRLI, Dale Wilcox, says his nonprofit and FAIR will keep fighting for immigration policies that put America first. ‘The SPLC’s latest tactic in its never-ending witch-hunt and the federal government’s resulting reprimand should send the following message to the mainstream media,’ Wilcox said: ‘Stop using the SPLC as a legitimate hate-watch source in your news coverage. That a cabal of biased list-keepers can play such an important role in distorting the immigration debate in this country is testament to the utter failure of much of the mainstream media which frequently publishes their inflammatory commentary and refuses to question their baseless methods or financial motivations,'” Judicial Watch said.\n\nThe letter explained the DOJ stopped short of “formal disciplinary proceeding[s],” instead opting for the rebuke in the letter.\n\n“We take this opportunity to remind the attorney practitioners involved in this misconduct that practitioners before EOIR should be striving to be civil and professional in their interactions with each other, the public, the board and immigration courts. Attorneys owe a duty of professionalism to their clients, opposing parties and their counsel, the courts, and the public as a whole.”\n\nTo really understand the war zone America is becoming, read the June issue of WND’s acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, “RAGE AND VIOLENCE: Why the Left has gone insane in the Age of Trump.”","http://www.wnd.com/2017/06/scalise-shooter-liked-southern-poverty-law-center/","None"

Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30,” a recording of Obama’s speech shared on Snapchat said. “Imagine a world without white people.” Obama was of course referring to the scientific belief that if whites continue to breed at low rates in America while others races continue to breed at current rates, white babies will be virtually nonexistent in our country by 2038.\n\nA post quoting Obama was shared more than 14,000 times with a reach of nearly 1 million Americans, which forced Harvard to take action.\n\n“This sort of attack against any race is uncalled for,” Harvard Dean Cain Markholder said in a statement Sunday. “Ms. Obama has been informed she is suspended pending an investigation into her statement.” But it gets worse for Obama — Markholder says that if a disciplinary board finds her guilty, she will “forfeit her grade for the exam” which is worth 47% of her grade according to one of the students who shared video of her racist hate speech-filled attack on whites.\n\nThe dean notes that punishment for racist attacks like this can lead to “expulsion,” but we’re sure that her dad will once again bail her out of trouble.","http://onlypolitics.info/breaking-malia-obama-suspended-after-racist-anti-white-attack-goes-viral/","None"
"Spicer: “POTUS Didn’t Misspell ‘Covfefe’ – As Head Of State, He Has The Legal Power To Decide How English Is Spelled”\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer drew widespread laughter from reporters when he insisted that President Donald Trump’s infamous “covfefe” tweet was not a misspelling. After one reporter asked Spicer if “people should be concerned that the president posted somewhat of an incoherent tweet last night,” Spicer simply replied, “No.” The reporter then asked Spicer why the misspelled tweet stayed up for so long. “The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,” Spicer replied, which elicited laughter throughout the room. Reporters then tried to ask Spicer what “covfefe” actually means, but he quickly moved on to another question.\n\nHowever, reporters were relentless in their intention to get the press secretary to reveal more on the subject, if for anything, to have a few more laughs. Spicer then turned to his usual rant about how Donald Trump is persecuted by mainstream media. “You know, I really have to tell you, this is getting old,” Spicer said. “This is just another attempt by the media to bash on President Trump and everything he’s trying to do for this country – you know it and I know it. And I get that it’s your job to make sure to have sought-after topics to write about and make the headlines and ultimately get likes and shares and whatnot, but I wonder, do you ever ask yourself where the line is? There has to be a line you people aren’t willing to tread, even in your line of work.”\n\nThe press secretary then turned to defending the president’s tweet. “You don’t realize how much this is all playing into Donald Trump’s hand, this is exactly what he’s after. He’s that smart, believe me,” he said. “If you just think about it, it’s virtually impossible for a man who’s built an empire worth billions of dollars to do something like this by sheer accident because he, what, couldn’t see the keyboard and tapped on the wrong letters? If that’s what you think, then you honestly don’t deserve to be sitting here and doing the job you’re doing. Far be it for me to put words into his mouth, but you know just as well as I that the president is very calculated and that he knows what he’s doing every step of the way. So, ask yourself if it was really an accident.”\n\n“My point is – it’s beyond whether or not it happened intentionally. Many of you may not like it, but the fact is that Donald Trump is the head of state and as such, it is within his legal right and power to decide how words in the English language are spelled, written, conjugated and all that good stuff. We have a beautiful language, but the thing about languages is – they’re living, breathing organisms. They change and they evolve along with the people who speak them, so it’s a natural progression. I wouldn’t be surprised if ‘covfefe’ turns up on Wikipedia or in dictionaries in schools throughout America as early as tomorrow. Because, that’s just one of the many perks of being President of the United States. It comes with the territory and it’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to use it,” Spicer concluded./politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/06/02/spicer-potus-didnt-misspell-covfefe-head-state-legal-power-decide-english-spelled/","1496376000.0"
"Katy Perry Says ‘Praying To Satan’ Should Be On Your ‘Bucket List’\nExperiencing “Satan’s raw power” is something everybody should experience at least once in their lifetime, according to Katy Perry, who advised fans to “add praying to Satan to your bucket list.“\n\n“People who say they’ll ‘try anything once’ are usually full of shit. How do I know this? Because if they tried praying to Satan just once, they’d be doing it every day. Multiple times per day. It’s really that powerful. It’s a real trip.“\n\nSpeaking at a Stella McCartney fashion event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Katy Perry denied rumors that she has undergone plastic surgery, and instead attributed her refreshed look to a new “spiritual outlook“.\n\nAdvising everybody to “add praying to Satan to your bucket list”, Katy Perry compared her first time praying to Satan to a mythical movie, ‘When Beckie Met Chad.’\n\n“My first time was like ‘When Beckie Met Chad,” she said, laughing at herself. “People who are used to praying to God, praying to Jesus or whatever, well, praying to Satan tends to rock the foundations of your world and changes your perceptions of who you thought you were.\n\n“It’s a whole extra level of amazing. People often say they feel like they’ve opened a door and a real power has washed through them, it’s, like, physical. It’s like opening your front door in a hurricane.”\n\n“Life is short, huh?” said the host.\n\n“I’ve heard the rumors,” she said. “Everybody’s talking about it. Oh, and the younger you start, the better. The brain refuses to adapt to new stimuli after a certain age. It’s like that with music too. The areas of the brain that deal with music and spirituality are closely linked.“\n\nKaty Perry’s Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. The daughter of two pastors, Katy Perry started her career as a country singer before reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.\n\nSince establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, the singer has attempted to tame her dark image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly sold her soul to Satan.\n\nThe incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun using celebrities to openly promote Satanism as a viable religious choice for young people seeking spiritual guidance.\n\nPerry made public overtures to the Illuminati in 2014, flaunting herself and begging to join the secret society.\n\n“Listen,” she said to Rolling Stone, “if the Illuminati exist, I would like to be invited! I see all that shit, and I’m like, Come on, let me in! I want to be in the club!”\n\nFast forward four years and Katy Perry is basically demonic play dough. She has been at the forefront of the elite’s agenda for years now, and has completed the transaction of her soul to the industry.","http://yournewswire.com/katy-perry-satan-bucket-list/","1516211026.0"

"Ted Cruz: “Southern States Should Build Their Own Nuclear Weapon To Protect Their Beliefs”\n“Over the weekend, GOP presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Rick Perry joined the GOP’s evangelical outreach coordinator Chad Connelly and North Carolina pastor Ron Baity – famous for warning that God would send a disease worse than Ebola in punishment for gay marriage – at a “We Stand With God” rally in front of the South Carolina state capitol meant to remind elected leaders that there are still people who “stand for God’s definition of family.”\n\n“Cruz, unsurprisingly, focused much of his sermon-like speech on claiming that advances in LGBT rights are in fact “persecuting” conservative Christian business owners who refuse to serve LGBT customers. Discussing a few of the people he brought to his persecution-palooza in Iowa earlier this month, he warned the South Carolina crowd that they might be next and that eventually the U.S. will become like Iran, which has imprisoned American pastor Saeed Abedini.\n\n“They are out to exterminate us,” Cruz raged on. “They are out and they are on the hunt for God-fearing conservative Christians whose only idea of a family entails a man and a woman and nothing else. They are like a beast who’s had a taste of blood, Christian blood, and is now out for the kill. You are all and danger, I am in danger, Christians throughout America are in danger. It started with the Supreme Court ruling, and the way things are going, I’m afraid to think how it’ll end.”\n\nHe also added: “What scares me the most is that there are people out there who don’t seem to notice the persecution that’s going on under their very noses. I mean, how stupid do you have to be to not see things for what they are? You have gays running rampant on one hand, and Christians being lynched on the other. It’s as though we’re back in the dark Middle Ages.”\n\n“But, there is a solution. Or rather, there could be. I believe the southern states of America should come together in a joint effort to protect their religious freedom, what little of it they, we, have left. We are running out of time. We should build a nuclear bomb and use it to defend our right to believe in God as our one true Father.”\n\nCruz also added that he would “draw the line at building the device, because killing fellow Americans, as deviant as they may be, is not right.” “Let us not use it on our brothers and sisters who are wandering in the dark, for they are not lost. They will come back to us some day, once they realize the error of their ways. Until then, the atomic bomb should remain a guarantee of Christians’ right to believe in straight marriage and traditional values.”/politicono\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/06/05/ted-cruz-southern-states-build-nuclear-weapon-protect-beliefs/","1496635200.0"
"‘Trump Was Merely Sharing The Gospel With That Porn Star,’ Explains Jim Bakker\nBLUE EYE, MO—Squashing accusations that President Trump had a sexual encounter with porn star “Stormy Daniels” while he was married to Melania, televangelist Jim Bakker explained to his audience Friday that he had confirmed that Trump was merely scheduling private time with the woman in a hotel suite in order to share with her the good news of Jesus Christ, as he had become acquainted with her and was very concerned that she was not a Christian.\n\n“It is preposterous to assert that a virtuous believer like Mr. Trump would cheat on his beautiful wife so callously, and while their child was only months old,” a solemn Bakker said into the camera as colorful balloons provided a backdrop for some reason. “He was so concerned with the eternal state of Miss Daniels’ soul that he scheduled some alone time with just the two of them, so he could share with her how Jesus Christ had changed his life and how He could also save her from her sins.”\n\nNearly choking up with tears, Bakker went on to explain how much he loves and looks up to Trump as a model saint.\n\n“Our president even arranged through his attorney to give this woman $130,000 in an attempt to help rescue her from the destructive adult film industry and get her life back on track.

"Spicer: “Trump Has The Legal Right To Cancel SCOTUS Because They Serve At His Pleasure”\nDuring a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. “If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “That is a fact.”\n\nAsked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – Spicer argued that the Constitution “clearly states” what the President of the United States can and cannot do. “However,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.”\n\nSpicer continued, “As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.”\n\n“This is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,” Spicer concluded./politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/06/21/spicer-trump-legal-right-cancel-scotus-serve-pleasure/","1498017600.0"
"Dying 78 Year Old CIA Agent Admits To Killing Marilyn Monroe\nShare Us.\n\nA 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.\n\nIn amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.\n\nHodges says he has no regrets.\n\nHe claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.\n\nHodges had worked for the CIA.\n\nHodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.\n\nHe was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.\n\nDespite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.\n\nHe also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.\n\nHodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.\n\n“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”\n\nMarilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.\n\nThe FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.\n\nThe most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.\n\nThis could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!","http://sciencevibe.com/2018/04/11/dying-78-year-old-cia-agent-admits-to-killing-marilyn-monroe/","1523419200.0"
"Scott Baio, Beloved Face Of Conservatism, Dies In Small Plane Crash On His Way To Visit Trump\nChachi can now apologize to Joannie for being so rude. Scott Baio, 56, was killed when the single-engine Cessna he was in crashed into the side of a hill in Louisiana. Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold with President Trump.\n\nBaio’s wife, Raylene, wasn’t on the plane but was checked into St Timothy’s on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldn’t be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was “really special as Chachi” and he “sure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge.”\n\nBaio, wildly successful as an actor since the ripe age of 13, says he saved every dime he ever made so he could live the lavish lifestyle of jetting across the country to golf with famous and powerful people. Unfortunately, that ended with a net worth of about $3.5 million and a whole lot of that was tied up in that nice house of his, so Baio was forced to go Cessna instead, which only would have gotten him there slightly faster than that new Kia Sorento he’s been sporting.\n\nBaio will be missed by many. His ability to retweet things in support of our glorious president without even bothering to care what they were truly drove the social media movement to get Trump elected. When he heard the news that Baio was killed, Trump asked for a moment of silence in the dining room during his morning coffee and strudel. He hasn’t personally responded but Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP told Freedom Crossroads correspondent Louis Leweigh:\n\n“The President was saddened by the news once we reminded him that Scott was once ‘Chachi.’ He said he wished he knew the kid was coming; he would have sent the jet.”\n\nTo clear it up, libtards, he would probably send the company jet and not Air Force One. Maybe one of the smaller planes like the Secretary of State gets but nothing bigger than that. Baio’s remains are scattered with the wreckage, with slammed nose first into a cliff face. The FCC said the pilot probably got disoriented in a cloud bank and came at a 30-degree downward angle directly into solid quartz with a touch of limestone. The plane fell nearly 1400 feet to the basin below where very little was recognizable.\n\nBaio had no known connection to the Clintons — Trey Gowdy is investigating.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://dailyusaupdate.com/scott-baio-beloved-face-conservatism-dies-small-plane-crash-way-visit-trump/","1496280782.0"
"California Gov. Jerry Brown To Release 10,000 Pedophiles, Rapists From Prison\nOver 10,000 sex offenders including convicted pedophiles and rapists are set to be released to the streets in the near future thanks to Governor Jerry Brown and the ruling of a Superior Court Judge in Sacramento who say crimes such as “intimately touching an unlawfully restrained person” or “raping a drugged or unconscious victim” are not violent crimes.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that Sacramento Superior Court Judge Allen Sumner issued a preliminary order on Friday to California state prison officials which ordered them to rewrite their regulations stemming from Prop. 57.\n\nThe ruling means individuals convicted of offenses such as incest, pimping minors into prostitution and possession of child pornography will soon be free to walk among the public again.\n\nIn a bid to reduce overcrowding in state prisons, California voters in 2016 approved a ballot measure known as Proposition 57 which allows for the early parole release of supposedly “non-violent offenders“.\n\nThe measure passed, in part, based on a statement from Democrat Gov. Jerry Brown which promised that individuals convicted of non-violent sexual offenses would be excluded from consideration for early release, according to The Daily Caller.\n\nThe state argued that language within Prop. 57 gave officials “broad discretion” to include any class of offenders for consideration for early parole, but Judge Sumner disagreed and argued that voters want to see pedophiles and rapists released from prison early.\n\n“If the voters had intended to exclude all registered sex offenders from early parole consideration under Proposition 57, they presumably would have said so,” Judge Sumner stated.\n\nHe stated further that the Corrections Department could only exclude violent sex offenders from early parole, and ordered the department to more accurately define what constituted a violent sexual offense. In Judge Sumner’s opinion, pimping a minor or restraining and sexually assaulting a victim are not violent enough to constitute a violent sexual offense.\n\nOn top of that, he also stated that sexual offenders who had already served time for their crimes — even violent ones — but were in prison on an unrelated non-violent offense “must be included in the early parole consideration process” and let out of prison early.\n\nConservative Tribune reports that the Judge’s ruling was praised by the president of the advocate group “California Reform Sex Offender Laws”, Janice Belluci, who estimated the change could allow for the release of roughly half of the state’s more than 20,000 sex offenders serving time in prison.\n\nShe argued that anyone convicted of a sex crime who was not included on the state’s narrow list of 23 violent offenses — things like murder, kidnapping and rape — must be considered released from prison early like other non-violent convicts.\n\n“Until they figure something else out, they have to consider anybody convicted of a nonviolent offense even if it was a sex offense,” Bellucci told reporters outside the courtroom. “We believe we’ve won a battle, but the war continues.”\n\nWhat is the California Reform Sex Offender Laws group fighting a war against? Justice?\n\nIt is worth noting that in addition to those convicted of incest, pimping a minor or possessing child pornography, the state of California will now be required to consider early release for those individuals convicted of offenses like indecent exposure, intimately touching an unlawfully restrained person or even raping a drugged or unconscious victim, which is now inconceivably no longer considered a violent crime by the liberal state.","http://yournewswire.com/california-brown-pedophiles-rapists/","1518802767.0"

"Melania Trump Hired Exorcist To ‘Cleanse White House Of Obama Demons’\nFirst Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” from “the Clinton and Obama years” removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.\n\n“I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,” Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.\n\n“They cleansed the White House,” the pastor said. “They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”\n\nAfter the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left – a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.\n\n“Because apparently during the eight years when Obama was there, and maybe even some of the presidents before him, there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic, even some of the stuff from the Clinton era,” Begley said.\n\nThe White House pastor then related that the First Lady said, “‘You’ve got to get all of that out of there and send in some preachers and priests‘” – she wanted respected Christian leaders — to go in and cleanse the White House or, ‘I will not spend one night in it.’”\n\n“I have to say, when the president allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House and anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him—seven times he’s done this—that is unheard of,” Begley said. “We haven’t ever – the guy’s got flaws, we all do. But at least he is humble enough and recognizing that he needs God enough that he keeps bringing them in for the prayer.”\n\nPastor Begley made his remarks during the Feb. 2 edition of Weekend Vigilante, hosted by Sheila Zilinsky.\n\nIn his book, My Life, former president Bill Clinton confessed that he and Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where an alleged “spirit arrived,” possessed participants walked on hot coals and burnt their flesh with fire, and at one point, a person bit the head off a living chicken.\n\nA Wikileaks classified email released in 2016 also exposed Hillary Clinton for what she really is – an occultist who bows down to Moloch, the same pagan god they perform human sacrifice rituals for at the annual Bohemian Grove meetings.\n\nIn a Clinton email from August 29 2008 published by Wikileaks, a senior government staffer writes to Hillary Clinton, “With fingers crossed, the old rabbit’s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .”\n\nLater that year Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta was also exposed dabbling in the occult. WikiLeaks emails revealed he and his brother Tony fraternized with Marina Abramovich at Satanic “spirit cooking” dinner parties, featuring pig’s blood, countless human fluids, and mock human sacrifices.\n\nWith previous tenants like the Clintons and Obamas, and the kind of company those families kept, it is no wonder Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a full exorcism before she set foot in the building.","http://yournewswire.com/melanic-trump-exorcist-white-house/","1518124801.0"
"Joel Osteen Sails Luxury Yacht Through Flooded Houston To Pass Out Copies Of ‘Your Best Life Now’\nHOUSTON, TX—Although Joel Osteen took flak over the weekend for closing up his church to flood victims and all but disappearing during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, the megachurch pastor reportedly returned to the city on his luxury yacht “S.S. Blessed” to make amends Tuesday by tossing copies of Your Best Life Now to stranded flood survivors.\n\nOsteen had his on-call yacht captain steer the large vessel through the flooded streets of the city, pulling up to survivors stranded on their roofs and on the roof of their cars as the prosperity gospel preacher smiled, waved, and threw out signed editions of the bestselling positive thinking book.\n\n“Believe and declare you are coming into a shift!” Osteen yelled through a bullhorn, according to reports. “God wants His best for you! Enlarge your vision, develop a healthy self image, and choose to be happy!”\n\n“When you think positive, excellent thoughts, you will be propelled toward greatness!” he called out to one family floating on a raft on a freeway-turned-river, whose earthly possessions had been entirely destroyed the previous day.\n\nOsteen also paused for brief photo ops with several families, the smiling pastor briefly allowing them to board his yacht as his professional photography team got shots of the pastor together with the sobbing, distraught flood victims, though the pastor was careful to not stand too close to the mud-caked refugees. Sources confirmed that the pastor then had his assistants help the families back into their makeshift lifeboats or tree logs on which they were floating through the city.","http://babylonbee.com/news/joel-osteen-sails-luxury-yacht-flooded-houston-pass-copies-best-life-now/","1504023569.0"
"Waste Management To Offer Dead Body Pickup Service In Response To Proposed Health Care Changes\nHouston, TX — The Houston-based Waste Management corporation announced a plan to offer curbside dead body pickup service to offset what critics say would be a direct result “TrumpCare,” which will overwhelm present mortuary services. Weekly pickup will be available at a reduced rate but special same day retrieval will cost more for individuals not comfortable with the smell of death lingering in their home. Body bags are available on their website but they will accept bodies properly bagged and duct taped to ensure minimal leakage of fluids.\n\nAs the largest environmental solutions provider in North America, they have the power to revolutionize the business model for cleaning up neighborhoods of excess dead bodies. Many have expressed concerns this will impact the small mortuary businesses so we talked to our local mortuary, Hooper, and Weaver, to document their opinion on the subject. The owner didn’t want to talk to us, but we were able to talk to Gus the embalming guy.\n\n“With millions of Americans about to lose health coverage I think there will be plenty of dead bodies for everyone,” Gus told us while he searched for a vein on an elderly man’s bloated corpse.\n\n“Not everyone has the money for fancy funerals, some families just need their dead relatives out of the house in a timely fashion and I think Waste Management has the resources to make that happen,” he elaborated while we admired the various tubes and contraptions involved in the embalming process.\n\nRecently Trump raised the possibility of letting ObamaCare fail and then putting together a health care plan.\n\n“As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great health care plan. Stay tuned!” Trump tweeted.\n\nThis shows the Trump administration’s commitment to ensuring pre-existing conditions are not covered thus saving money for insurance companies around the country. It is suspected he is most concerned about the name change from “ObamaCare” to “TrumpCare” as it is apparent he likes to name things after himself such as the Trump Tower and Trump Airlines.","https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.ncscooper.com/waste-management-to-offer-dead-body-pickup-service-in-response-to-proposed-health-care-changes/","1500492308.0"
"ACLU Complains: 'Trump Used the Word 'America' More Than 80 Times'\n(Screen Capture)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - The American Civil Liberties Union -- note the word 'American' in its title -- complained Tuesday night about President Trump's repeated use of the word 'America' in his State of the Union speech.\n\n\n\nIn a written response to Trump's speech, Faiz Shakir, the ACLU's national political director, said:\n\nTonight, President Trump said the word ‘America’ more than 80 times in his speech. Yet, after a divisive first year, we hear and feel how exclusionary that ‘America’ is, with policies that have harmed so many vulnerable American communities. The ACLU stands ready to protect these communities, both in the courts and at the polls.\n\n\n\nIn particular, the immigration plan put forth by Trump would hold Dreamers hostage to his demands for a harmful border wall and an even larger mass deportation force. We are at this crossroads because of the President’s deeply destructive ideas fomented by his nativist allies and divisive rhetoric. We will continue to stand up for these young immigrants and ensure they continue to contribute to our country. We cannot let America’s Dreamers be deported.\n\nPresident Trump told the nation Monday night that Congress will be voting on an 'immigration reform' package over the next few weeks, and he outlined the 'four pillars' of his 'fair compromise' plan:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four pillars include a path to citizenship for 1.8 million dreamers, if they meet education and work requirements and demostrate good moral character; a fully secure border, including a wall in places and hiring more border patrol agents; an end to the random diversity visa lottery and adoption of a merit-based system; and an end to chain migration by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. (Democrats offered scattered boos to the last item.)\n\n\n\n'These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system,' Trump said. 'For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\n\n\n\n'Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.'","https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/aclu-complains-trump-said-america-more-80-times-his-speech-its-exclusionary/","1517401351.0"
"Reporter Who Exposed BBC Pedophilia Cover Up Found Dead\nLiz MacKean, the former British investigative reporter who exposed Jimmy Savile and the culture of pedophile protection at the BBC, has been found dead. She was 52.\n\nMacKean worked at the BBC until she quit in 2013 after executives decided to ban her groundbreaking and brave investigation into predatory pedophile Jimmy Savile in order to protect him and other pedophiles.\n\nDismissed by the establishment as mad and dangerous, MacKean was finally vindicated when the truth about Savile’s pedophilia eventually came out in 2012, a full year after MacKean first tried to bring his notorious crimes to light.\n\nThe BBC, who blocked her groundbreaking investigation from airing and spent the next few years attempting to destroy her reputation, are reporting that she died of “complications from a stroke.”\n\nAcknowledging her life was under threat during the time she was investigating Savile and BBC elites, MacKean said her conscience left her no option but to pursue the truth and expose the culture of pedophila. The mother of two children believed it was her duty.\n\nWhen it became public that BBC News blocked her investigation from airing, she admitted on Panorama: “I was very unhappy the story didn’t run because I felt we’d spoken to people who collectively deserved to be heard. And they weren’t heard.\n\n“I thought that that was a failure… I felt we had a responsibility towards them. We got them to talk to us, but above all, we did believe them. And so then, for their stories not to be heard, I felt very bad about that. I felt, very much, that I’d let them down.”\n\nBig name stars\n\nLiz MacKean is the second high profile BBC journalist to die in suspicious circumstances after attempting to expose the truth about the pedophile ring operating in the upper reaches of the establishment. Jill Dando, former Crimewatch host, also tried to alert her bosses to the pedophile ring at the BBC, warning that “big name” stars were implicated.\n\nJill Dando, who was 37, was shot dead on April 26, 1999 on the doorstep of her West London home in a crime that still remains unsolved.\n\nBefore she died, Dando had passed a file to senior management in the mid-1990s, proving that big name BBC stars, including Savile, were involved in a pedophile ring, but senior management chose to cover up the child abuse rather than organize and investigation.\n\n“No one wanted to know” when Dando raised concerns about the alleged ring and other sexual abuse claims at the BBC, according to a former colleague and friend.\n\n“I don’t recall the names of all the stars now and don’t want to implicate anyone, but Jill said they were surprisingly big names.\n\n“I think she was quite shocked when told about images of children and that information on how to join this horrible paedophile ring was freely available.\n\n“Jill said others had complained to her about sexual matters and that some female workmates also claimed they had been groped or assaulted.\n\n“Nothing had been done and there seemed to be a policy of turning a blind eye.”\n\nThe former colleague said female BBC staff confided in Jill, one of the best-known TV faces of the day after fronting primetime shows including Holiday and the Six O’Clock News as well as Crimewatch.’\n\nThe source said: “I think it was in the mid-1990s.

"DeVos To Strike More Than 4.5 Billion Years Of Earth’s History From School Curriculum\nWASHINGTON, D.C. — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced today that the 2017-2018 school year will feature drastically revised history texts for all school grades. At a luncheon being held at a D.C. area school for corporate backers of charter schools, DeVos announced that all history books will contain only the information that can also be found in the Christian Bible.\n\n“If it’s not important enough to be mentioned in the Bible,” Secretary DeVos stated, “I don’t see why it’s important enough to be in our texbooks.”\n\nDeVos said that there were numerous reasons for the decision, first and foremost being financial concerns.\n\n“Do you know how much more economical and affordable history and science texts are that only have to cover six thousand years instead of billions and billions,” DeVos asked of the luncheaon attendees, adding that “Money doesn’t grow on trees.”\n\nWhile acknowledging that history and scientific breakthroughs have certainly occurred in the time between when the Bible was written and now, DeVos said that reasoning falls short of convincing her.\n\n“Maybe there have been over 2,000 years of recorded history since the Bible was written,” DeVos admitted, “but has anything really important happened?”\n\nA woman attending the luncheon raised her hand. DeVos called on her, saying that she wasn’t prepared to take questions, but that she was happy to find such a “bright, enthusiastic, engaged” audience member.\n\n“I heard you just say that nothing really all that important has happened in the last couple centuries,” the woman said as DeVos smiled and nodded in the affirmative, her stare fixed and nearly vacant, “but, um, that seems kinda crazy to me.”\n\nDeVos didn’t understand what the woman meant.\n\n“I don’t understand what you mean,” DeVos said, “but what I said was very easy to understand. Nothing that has happened in the last two thousand years is really all that important, not enough to teach our kids about, anyway.”\n\nThe woman persisted.\n\n“But there’s so much that has happened,” she said, “from Bubonic plauge to the Renaissance. From the discovery of the new world, the founding of our very own country upon that land. We – ”\n\nDeVos cut the woman off abruptly.\n\n“Oh, the founding of our…that was…” Secretary DeVos was sputtering, muttering about how she believed that the United States was founded “before Jesus was hung up on the cross.” The woman questioner brought DeVos her smart phone, with a Google search for when the country was founded on its web browser.\n\n“No. That’s un-possible,” DeVos said, “That’s not what I was always taught. And if you’re going to tell me my Sunday and homeschooling isn’t up to snuff just because we don’t teach actual academic subjects in it, you can get the hell right outta my country, sister! This is my country now. I bought this position fair and square. Hundreds of millions of bucks, y’all. So you know what? Fuck your history. Fuck your math. Fuck your science. It’s DeVos time, BABY!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom out of nowhere someone threw DeVos a basketball. DeVos dribbled it a few times, running up to the hoop in the gymnasium the luncheon was held in. She jumped from the free throw line, did a 360-tomahawk jam, and brought the backboard down.\n\nAt least that’s how she later reported the incident to President Trump, and that’s an alternative set of facts he’ll never stop believing. So he tweeted it.\n\nFollow James on Twitter @JamboSchlarmbo.\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.politicalgarbagechute.com/devos-history-books/","1488751712.0"
"Take Back Your Strawman - YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE BOND IS WORTH BILLIONS\nWhen your birth certificate was monetized and converted into a UNITED STATES Government Bond shortly after your birth by your Mother, your net worth became unlimited, into Billions of Dollars, without your, nor your Mother’s, and Father’s, knowledge.\n\n\n\nWhen the UNITED STATES declared bankruptcy in 1933 under the bankruptcy (Straw man) law known as HJR 192, pledged all Americans as collateral (debt slaves) against the national debt to the International Bankers; gave all the\n\nland to the international bankers (Federal Reserve Corporation); and confiscated and outlawed all the gold except for one ounce for each person; thus, eliminating the lawful means (Gold and Silver Coins) by which you could legally pay your debt, the UNITED STATES also assumed legal responsibility for providing a new way for you to pay.\n\n\n\nIn 1933, the UNITED STATES Government declared that they would pay all of YOUR debts with the money they receive from your labor, birth certificate, and Social Security registered number by what is known as your Reserve Account worth Billions!\n\n\n\nThe UNITED STATES Corporation Government did that by providing what is known as the Exemption Account.\n\n\n\nThe bankers loan credit and not money, because there has not been any lawful money since 5 June 1933.\n\n\n\nThe Exemption Account is your exemption from having to pay for anything.\n\n\n\nIn practical terms, though, this meant giving each American something to pay with, and that something is your credit.\n\n\n\nThis secret has been hidden for over 79 years.\n\n\n\nYour value to society was then and is still calculated using actuarial tables.\n\n\n\nAt birth, average value bonds were created from your birth certificate.\n\n\n\nI understand that this is currently between one and two million dollars at your birth when your mother unknowingly gave her baby, you, away to the UNITED STATES Government.\n\n\n\nThese birth certificate bonds were collateralized by your birth certificate and your mother’s maiden name under an Act of Congress in 1921.\n\n\n\nThen your birth certificate bond became a negotiable instrument just like any security instrument under UCC Article 3, code of commercial law in which the world trade falls under.\n\n\n\nThe bonds are hypothecated and traded on the stock market until their value is unlimited for all intents and purposes.\n\n\n\nPeople all over the world buy and sell your bond every day over the stock markets as investments.\n\n\n\nAll that credit created is technically, and rightfully, yours.\n\n\n\nIn point of fact, you should be able to go into any store in America and buy anything and everything in sight, telling the clerk to charge it to your Exemption Account, which is identified by a nine-digit number that you will recognize as your Social Security number, without the dashes.\n\n\n\nIt is your EIN, which stands for Exemption Identification Number from the UNITED STATES CORPORATION of America.'\n\n\n\n~ Anon\n\nTake Back Your Strawman\n\nUCC-1-Uniform Commercial Code-Take back your Strawman.\n\n\n\nOn April 5, 1933, then President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, under Executive Order, issued April 5, 1933, declared: 'All persons are required to deliver on or before May 1, 1933 all Gold Coin, Gold Bullion, & Gold Certificates now owned by them to a Federal Reserve Bank, branch or agency, or to any member bank of the Federal Reserve System.'\n\n\n\nJames A. Farley, Postmaster General at that time, required each postmaster in the country to post a copy of the Executive Order in a conspicuous place within each branch of the Post Office. On the bottom of the posting was the following:\n\n\n\nCRIMINAL PENALTIES for VIOLATION of EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\n\n\n$10, 000 fine or 10 years imprisonment, or both, as provided in Section 9 of the order.\n\n\n\nSection 9 of the order reads as follows: 'Whosoever willfully violates any provisions of this Executive Order or of these regulations or of any rule, regulation or license issued thereunder may be fined not more than $10,000, or if a natural person, may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both; & any officer, director or agency of any corporation who knowingly participates in any such violation may be punished by a like fine, imprisonment, or both.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Stated within a written document received September 17, 1997, from the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, Office of the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Richard L. Shiffin, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), was the following:\n\n'A fact that is frequently overlooked is that Executive Orders & proclamations of the President normally have no direct effect upon private persons or their property, & instead, normally constitute only directives or instructions to officers or employees of the Federal Government. The exception is those cases in which the President is expressly authorized or required by laws enacted by the Congress to issue an Executive order or proclamation dealing with the legal rights or obligations of members of the public. Such as issuance of Selective Service Regulations, establishment of boards to investigate certain labor disputes, & establishment of quotas or fees with respect to certain imports into this country.'\n\n\n\nNote: it seems rather obvious that President Franklin D. Roosevelt was not 'expressly authorized or required' to 'issue an Executive Order or proclamation' demanding the public (private) to relinquish their privately held gold.\n\n\n\nThe order (proclamation) issued by Roosevelt was an undisciplined act of treason. Two months after the Executive Order, on June 5, 1933, the Senate & House of Representatives, 73d Congress, 1st session, at 4:30 p.m. approve House Joint Resolution (HJR) 192: Joint Resolution To Suspend The Gold Standard & Abrogate The Gold Clause, Joint resolution to assure uniform value to the coins & currencies of the United States.\n\n\n\nHJR-192 states, in part, that 'Every provision contained in or made with respect to any obligation which purports to give the oblige a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency, or in any amount of money of the United States measured thereby, is declared to be against public policy, & no such provision shall be contained in or made with respect to any obligation hereafter incurred. Every obligation, heretofore or hereafter incurred, whether or not any such provisions is contained therein or made with respect thereto, shall be discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any such coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public & private debts.'\n\n\n\nHJR-192 goes on to state: 'As used in this resolution, the term 'obligation' means an obligation (including every obligation of & to the United States, excepting currency) payable in money of the United States; & the term 'coin or currency' means coin or currency of the United States, including Federal Reserve notes & circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks & national banking associations.'\n\n\n\nHJR-192 superseded Public Law (what passes as law today is only 'color of law'), replacing it with public policy. This eliminated our ability to PAY our debts, allowing only for their DISCHARGE. When we use any commercial paper (checks, drafts, warrants, federal reserve notes, etc.), & accept it as money, we simply pass the unpaid debt attached to the paper on to others, by way of our purchases & transactions. This unpaid debt, under public policy, now carries a public liability for its collection. In other words, all debt is now public.\n\n\n\nThe United States government, in order to provide necessary goods & services, created a commercial bond (promissory note), by pledging the property, labor, life & body of its citizens, as payment for the debt (bankruptcy). This commercial bond made chattel (property) out of every man, woman & child in the United States. We became nothing more than 'human resources' & collateral for the debt. This was without our knowledge &/or our consent. How? It was done through the filing (registration) of our birth certificates!\n\n\n\nThe United States government -actually the elected & appointed administrators of government -took (& still do, to this day) certified copies of all our birth certificates & placed them in the United States Department of Commerce ... as registered securities. These securities, each of which carries an estimated $1,000,000 (one million) dollar value, have been (& still are) circulated around the world as collateral for loans, entries on the asset side of ledgers, etc., just like any other security. There's just one problem, we didn't authorize it.\n\n\n\nThe United States is a District of Columbia corporation. In Volume 20: Corpus Juris Sec. § 1785 we find 'The United States government is a foreign corporation with respect to a State' (see: NY re: Merriam 36 N.E. 505 1441 S. 0.1973, 14 L. Ed. 287). Since a corporation is a fictitious 'person' (it can not speak, see, touch, smell, etc.), it can not, by itself, function in the real world. It needs a conduit, a transmitting utility, a liaison of some sort, to 'connect' the fictional person, & fictional world in which it exists, to the real world.\n\n\n\nLIVING people, exist in a real world, not a fictional, virtual world. But government does exist in a fictional world, & can only deal directly with other fictional or virtual persons, agencies, states, etc.. In order for a fictional person to deal with real people there must be a connection, a liaison, & a go-between. This can be something as simple as a contract. When both 'persons,' the real & the fictional, agree to the terms of a contract, there is a connection, intercourse, dealings, there is a communication, an exchange. There is business! But there is another way for fictional government to deal with the real man & woman: through the use of a representative, a liaison, & the go-between. Who is this go-between, this liaison that connects fictional government to real men & women? It's a government created shadow, a fictional man or woman ... with the same name as ours.\n\n\n\nThis PERSON was created by using our birth certificates as the MCO (manufacturer's certificate of origin) & the state in which we were born as the 'port of entry'. This gave fictional government a fictional PERSON with whom to deal directly. This PERSON is a strawman.\n\n\n\nSTRAMINEUS HOMO: Latin: A man of straw, one of no substance, put forward as bail or surety. This definition comes from Black's Law Dictionary, 6th. Edition, page 1421. Following the definition of STRAMINEUS HOMO in Black's we find the next word, Strawman. STRAWMAN: A front, a third party who is put up in name only to take part in a transaction. Nominal party to a transaction; one who acts as an agent for another for the purposes of taking title to real property & executing whatever documents & instruments the principal may direct. Person who purchases property for another to conceal identity of real purchaser or to accomplish some purpose otherwise not allowed. Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines the term 'strawman' as: 1: a weak or imaginary opposition set up only to be easily confuted 2: a person set up to serve as a cover for a usually questionable transaction. The Strawman can be summed up as an imaginary, passive stand-in for the real participant; a front; a blind; a person regarded as a nonentity. The Strawman is a 'shadow', a go-between. For quite some time a rather large number of people in this country have known that a man or woman's name, written in ALL CAPS, or last name first, does not identify real, living people. Taking this one step further, the rules of grammar for the English language have no provisions for the abbreviation of people's names, i.e. initials are not to be used. As an example, John Adam Smith is correct. ANYTHING else is not correct. Not Smith, John Adam or Smith, John A. or J. Smith or J. A. Smith or JOHN ADAM SMITH or SMITH, JOHN or any other variation. NOTHING, other than John Adam Smith identifies the real, living man. All other appellations identify either a deceased man or a fictitious man: such as a corporation or a STRAWMAN.\n\n\n\nOver the years government, through its 'public' school system, has managed to pull the wool over our eyes & keep US ignorant of some very important facts. Because all facets of the media (print, radio, television) have an ever-increasing influence in our lives, & because media is controlled (with the issuance of licenses, etc.) by government & its agencies, we have slowly & systematically been led to believe that any form/appellation of our names is, in fact, still us: as long as the spelling is correct. WRONG!\n\n\n\nWe were never told, with full & open disclosure, what our government officials were planning to do & why.\n\nWe were never told that government (the United States) was a corporation, a fictitious 'person'.\n\nWe were never told that government had quietly, almost secretly, created a shadow, a STRAWMAN for each & every AMERICAN, so that government could not only 'control' the people, but also raise an almost unlimited amount of revenue - so it could continue not just to exist, but to GROW.\n\nWe were never told that when government deals with the STRAWMAN it is not dealing with real, living, men & women.\n\nWe were never told, openly & clearly with full disclosure of all the facts, that since June 5, 1933, we have been unable to pay our debts.\n\nWe were never told that we had been pledged (& our children, & their children, & their children, & on & on) as collateral, mere chattel, for the debt created by government officials who committed treason in doing so.\n\nWe were never told that they quietly & cleverly changed the rules, even the game itself, & that the world we perceive as real is in fact fictional -and it's all for their benefit.\n\nWe were never told that the STRAWMAN -a fictional person, a creature of the state -is subject to all the codes, statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, etc. decreed by government, but that WE, the real man & woman, are not. We were never told we were being treated as property, as slaves (albeit comfortably for some), while living in the land of the free -& that we could, easily, walk away from the fraud.\n\n\n\nWE WERE NEVER TOLD, WE WERE BEING ABUSED!\n\n\n\nThere's something else you should know: Everything, since June 1933, operates in COMMERCE! Commerce is based on agreement, contract. Government has an implied agreement with the Strawman (government's creation) & the Strawman is subject to government rule, as we illustrated above. But when we, the real flesh & blood man & woman, step into their 'process' we become the 'surety' for the fictional Strawman. Reality & fiction are reversed. We then become liable for the debts, liabilities & obligations of the Strawman, relinquishing our real (protected) character as we stand up for the fictional Strawman.\n\n\n\nSo that we can once again place the Strawman in the fictional world & ourselves in the real world (with all our 'shields' in place against fictional government) we must send a nonnegotiable (private) 'Charge Back' & a nonnegotiable 'Bill of Exchange' to the United States Secretary of Treasury, along with a copy of our birth certificate, the evidence, the MCO, of the Strawman. By doing this we discharge our portion of the public debt, releasing US, the real man, from the debts, liabilities & obligations of the Strawman. Those debts, liabilities & obligations exist in the fictional commercial world of 'book entries', on computers &/or in paper ledgers. It is a world of 'digits' & 'notes', not of money & substance. Property of the real man once again becomes tax exempt & free from levy, as it must be in accord with HJR-192.\n\n\n\nSending the nonnegotiable Charge Back & Bill of Exchange accesses our Treasury Direct Account (TDA). What is our TDA? Let's go to Title 26 USC & take a look at section 163(h)(3)(B)(ii), $1,000,000 limitation: 'The aggregate amount treated as acquisition indebtedness for any period shall not exceed $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return).'\n\n\n\nThis $1,000,000 (one million) account is for the Strawman, the fictional 'person' with the name in all caps &/or last name first. It is there for the purpose of making book entries, to move figures, 'digits' from one side of ledgers to the other. Without constant movement a shark will die & quite ironically, like the shark, there must also be constant movement in commerce, or it too will die. Figures, digits, the entries in ledgers must move from asset side to debit side & back again, or commerce dies. No movement, no commerce.\n\n\n\nThe fictional person of government can only function in a fictional commercial world, one where there is no real money, only fictional funds ... mere entries, figures, & digits.\n\n\n\nA presentment from fictional government -from traffic citation to criminal charges -is a negative, commercial 'claim' against the Strawman. This 'claim' takes place in the commercial, fictional world of government. 'Digits' move from one side of your Strawman account to the other, or to a different account. This is today's commerce.\n\n\n\nIn the past we have addressed these 'claims' by fighting them in court, with one 'legal process' or another, & failed. We have played the futile, legalistic, dog-&-pony show -a very clever distraction -while the commerce game played on.\n\n\n\nBut what if we refused to play dog-&-pony, & played the commerce game instead? What if we learned how to control the flow & movement of entries, figures, & digits, for our own benefit? Is that possible? And if so, how? How can the real man in the real world, function in the fictional world in which the commerce game exists?\n\n\n\nWhen in commerce do as commerce does, use the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)? The UCC-1 Financing Statement is the one contract in the world that can NOT be broken & it's the foundation of the Accepted For Value process. The power of this document is awesome.\n\n\n\nSince the TDA exists for the Strawman -who, until now, has been controlled by government - WE can gain control (& ownership) of the Strawman by first activating the TDA & then filing an UCC-1 Financing Statement. This does two things for US.\n\n\n\nFirst, by activating the TDA we gain limited control over the funds in the account. This allows US to also move entries, figures, & digits ... for OUR benefit.\n\n\n\nSecondly, by properly filing an UCC-1 Financing Statement we can become the holder in due course of the Strawman. This gives us virtual ownership of the government created entity. So what? What does it all mean?\n\n\n\nRemember earlier we mentioned that a presentment from government or one of its agents or agencies was a negative commercial claim against the Strawman (& the Strawman's account, the TDA)? Remember we told you entries, figures, & digits moved from one side of the account to the other, or to a different account? Well now, with the Strawman under our control, government has no access to the TDA & they also lose their go-between, their liaison, their 'connection' to the real, living man & woman. From now on, when presented with a 'claim' (presentment) from government, we will agree with it (this removes the 'controversy') & we will ACCEPT IT FOR VALUE. By doing this we remove the negative claim against our account & become the 'holder in due course' of the presentment. As holder in due course you can require the sworn testimony of the presenter of the 'claim' (under penalty of perjury) & request the account be properly adjusted.\n\n\n\nIt's all business, a commercial undertaking, & the basic procedure is not complicated. In fact, it's fairly simple. We just have to remember a few things, like: this is not a 'legal' procedure -we're not playing dog-&-pony. This is commerce, & we play by the rules of commerce. We accept the 'claim', become the holder in due course, & challenge whether or not the presenter of the claim had/has the proper authority (the Order) to make the claim (debit our account) in the first place. When they cannot produce the Order (they never can, it was never issued) we request the account be properly adjusted (the charge, the 'claim ' goes away).\n\n\n\nIf they don't adjust the account a request is made for the bookkeeping records showing where the funds in question were assigned. This is done by requesting the Fiduciary Tax Estimate & the Fiduciary Tax Return for this claim. Since the claim has been accepted for value & is prepaid, & our TDA account is exempt from levy, the request for the Fiduciary Tax Estimate & the Fiduciary Tax Return is valid because the information is necessary in determining who is delinquent &/or making claims on the account. If there is no record of the Fiduciary Tax Estimate & the Fiduciary Tax Return, we then request the individual tax estimates & individual tax returns to determine if there is any delinquency.\n\n\n\nIf we receive no favorable response to the above requests, we will then file a currency report on the amount claimed/assessed against our account & begin the commercial process that will force them to either do what's required or lose everything they own -except for the clothing they are wearing at the time. This is the power of contracts (commerce) & it should be mentioned, at least this one time, that a contract overrides the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, & any other document other than another contract. We should also mention that no process of law -'color' of law under present codes, statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, etc. - can operate upon you, no agent &/or agency of government (including courts) can gain jurisdiction over you, WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. You, (we) are not within their fictional commercial venue.\n\n\n\nThe Accepted for Value process, however, gives us the ability to deal with 'them' -through the use of our transmitting utility/go-between, the Strawman -& hold them accountable in their own commercial world, for any action(s) they attempt to take against us. Without a proper Order, & now we know they're not in possession of such a document, they must leave us alone ... or pay the consequences.\n\n\n\nYes, this process IS powerful.\n\n\n\nYes, it CAN set us free from government oppression & control.\n\n\n\nBut remember: 'What goes around, comes around'. 'Do unto others, as you have others do unto you.' It's simple, folks, DO NOT ABUSE THIS PROCESS ... if you do it could come around & bite you.\n\nIt is a MUST to Listen to This Recording for Basic Understanding of the Dual Trusts\n\nLecture on Beneficiary & Trustee Status in Court Cases (.mp3 Audio File)\n\nSee Also:\n\nTitle 31 USC §5118\n\nBeneficiary & Trustee Status in Court Cases (transcribed .pdf) (transcribed .pdf)\n\nThe Power of Acceptance\n\nSTRAWMAN\n\n\n\nWhat can you do about it?

"BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Killed In Monster Truck Mishap\nHillary Clinton was sitting with friends and her daughter, Chelsea, at the Chappaqua Motor Speedway in upstate New York earlier this evening when 11 tons of American steel and irony jumped the rails, injuring thirty-five people and killing Clinton.\n\nThe machine, the Big Blue Bernie Or Buster, is a modified Jeep CJ-7. The right rear shock, with a diameter of 40 inches and weighing 403 pounds, imploded Clinton’s head at approximately 14 miles per hour. The coroner said it would have been a solid minute of excruciating pain combined with a cognitive awareness that your head was about to be crushed like a grape.\n\nThe driver of the Monster machine said when he realized he was going to lose it he headed straight for where he knew Clinton was sitting:\n\n“I had a decision to make. I could either steer into random people or try to minimize the damage by localizing it to the woman who is guilty of 218 murders, 40 DACA violations, Benghazi and the Russia scandal, not to mention Monica Lewinski. I did what i thought was tight. I’d do it again.”\n\nThe local police are calling the incident a “tragic and yet unavoidable accident.” They went on to applaud driver Greg Page for his quick actions that saved the lives of regular people.","https://dailyworldupdate.us/2018/05/01/breaking-hillary-clinton-killed-in-monster-truck-mishap/","1525147200.0"
"New $20 Bill Featuring Robert E. Lee to Make Early Debut in Southern U.S.\nRICHMOND, Va. – An updated version of the twenty-dollar bill featuring the American Confederate general Robert E. Lee is scheduled to make its debut in a handful of southern states later this month, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Treasury announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe new bill includes a portrait of the middle-aged Confederate general on its face while the reverse side features a scene depicting the Second Battle of Bull Run. “We are pleased to announce that the new twenty-dollar bill will make its debut on Monday, September 11th, in eleven states, including South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas,” Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis announced during a press conference Tuesday morning.\n\nThe decision to replace the existing twenty-dollar banknote, which entered circulation in 1996, comes as President Donald J. Trump continues to work diligently to reverse his predecessor’s policies. “We had Barack Obama, who – for eight years and without any prior authorization from Congress – decided he was going to put Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “Well, Wolf, he can’t do that,” Conway argued, continuing, “President Trump cares very deeply about the American people and he has said, time and time again, if we’re going to do it, we’ll replace one great man with another.”\n\nLess than a week after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin pointedly avoided voicing support for a $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing – the agency responsible for producing paper currency – released a statement saying “current color and shading capabilities limit our ability to adequately depict [Harriet Tubman] on most forms of U.S. currency.” The statement went on to say that increased shading would make the bill “too dark” and, therefore, more susceptible to counterfeiting.\n\nTreasury spokesperson Keith Davis said the redesigned twenty-dollar bill is scheduled for a nationwide release on January 19, 2018, and will coincide with the 211th anniversary of General Robert E. Lee’s birthday, as requested by the White House.","http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/09/new-20-bill-featuring-robert-e-lee-make-early-debut-southern-u-s/","1504621771.0"
"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 15 Days Of Darkness In November 2017\nThere have been many reports about the changes our planet Earth could endure in the months and years to come but many of them didn’t really pan out, making us question everything we read on the internet. But this time, NASA confirms what’s been circling the web recently – our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29.\n\nNASA reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didn’t know exactly when. Upon more detailed examination the astronomers from NASA confirmed that the phenomenon will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.\n\nAccording to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between Jupiter and Venus. There was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by Charles Bolden, head of NASA explaining the strange event to officials at the White House.\n\nAccording to the report, during this specific period Jupiter and Venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. Venus will move to the south-west of Jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. Venus’ bright light will heat up the gases in Jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. This reaction will come in contact with our Sun at 2:50 am on November 15th.\n\nOnce the hydrogen reaches the Sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the Sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. The whole process will generate so much heat that the Sun will change its color into a bluish shade. Once this happens, the Sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.\n\nAs a result of this strange phenomenon, the Sun’s light will be seen much dimmer from the Earth and hence the 15-day blackout NASA is talking about.\n\n“We do not expect any major effects from the Blackout event. The only effect this event will have on Earth is an increase of 6 – 8 degrees in temperature. the polar cap will be mostly affected by this. No one should worry much. This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter”, Bolden said.\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.globalrevolutionnetwork.com","http://reflectionofmind.org/nasa-confirms-earth-will-experience-15-days-darkness-november-2017/","1484211349.0"
"Gretchen Carlson: “The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented”\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn\n\nGretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15. Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”\n\nInterestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”\n\nAsked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”\n\n“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”\n\nCarlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”\n\n“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://therightists.com/gretchen-carlson-the-2nd-amendment-was-written-before-guns-were-invented/","None"
"After you read this, you’ll never put toilet paper on the seat again. Never.\nThere's something about public toilets that makes us feel extra germaphobic. We've all encountered situations where a stall's previous occupant hasn't bothered to look behind themselves before exiting. So do you really want to sit down there?\n\nThe answer seems obvious: a little bit of toilet paper on the seat and then at least there's a barrier between your body and the germs.\n\nTruth be told, this is not the best approach at all. Actually, you should never lay toilet paper down on the seat because toilet seats are really cleverly designed. For a long time, people thought the seats were covered in germs and nasties and people could pick up all kinds of horrible gastrointestinal infections from them. But given their special shape and their particularly smooth surfaces, toilet seats actually prevent bacteria from settling on them. In addition, germs cannot multiply on bare skin, so mere contact with the toilet seat is not so bad after all. Toilet paper, on the other hand, is a completely different story.\n\nWhich way do you hang your toilet paper? That says a lot about you https://t.co/r7fbvFExDq pic.twitter.com/VpIBnjWa0l — Newspip (@newspip) June 12, 2016\n\nIt's common knowledge that (almost) no one puts the toilet lid down after using and flushing the toilet. As a result, all those germs spread around the room and also on the toilet paper. And contrary to the toilet seat, toilet paper is an ideal place for germs to gather. Its surface makes it easy for bacteria to settle on. It is precisely this germ-infested toilet paper that you would reach out to grab with your hands and then, unconsciously, you would touch your face, allowing the bacteria the easiest passageway into your body.\n\nYou might be covering yourself in germs every time you flush the toilet: https://t.co/MrKz3P2s1Y pic.twitter.com/ouLLTftq1a — Women's Health (@WomensHealthMag) June 9, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same thing applies to the taps and hand dryers. People use the taps straight after doing their business, making the tap a real germ magnet. And the tap gets touched again after people are finished washing their hands. The same goes for electric hand dryers. In fact, a recent study showed that electric hand dryers spread bacteria to a large extent.\n\nAs a first point, the electric hand dryers stir up the air in the room and thereby launch the microbes and viral particles into the air and all over the room. Secondly, after washing hands, there are often residual germs, which instead of being removed by the hand driers, actually get spread all the more. In general, the greater the airflow, the greater the germ problem. The best alternative is paper towels. They get rid of significantly more germs.\n\nSo there you go, from now on you might look upon toilet paper more critically than the toilet seat itself. And the next time you use a public toilet, just remember, a blank seat is always the better option. It's hard, but sometimes our imagination of all the filth and disgust is actually more vivid than the actual risk.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.hefty.co/toilet-seat/","None"
"Celebrities Call For A Massive, All-Round Strike In Hollywood “Until The Fascist Trump Resigns”\n<span class=”fact”>Rosie O’Donnell, Debra Messing, Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists, entertainers, and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President-elect Donald Trump. “No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America!” reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. “Donald Trump, the President-elect, is assembling a regime of grave danger,” the ad says. “Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance – before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands.”</span>\n\nOther Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign, however, are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. “We’re calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops,” a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. “It’s about time people understood that we’re the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around.”\n\nAsked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip, the spokesperson argued that Hollywood “is, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue that’s holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right? Well, that’s exactly what’s going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while we’re on the subject, between you and me – nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move.”\n\n“Besides, it’s not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasn’t ventured into movies in his day, right? So, he’ll understand firsthand what’s going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, it’s not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; it’s the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the God’s honest truth is – without Hollywood, there is no America. It’s like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront – it just becomes pointless,” the spokesperson concluded.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://therightists.com/celebrities-call-for-a-massive-all-round-strike-in-hollywood-until-the-fascist-trump-resigns/","None"
"BUSTED: Trump-Hating School Shooting Survivor Visited CNN HQ Before the Shooting; Ranted Live on CNN After – True Pundit\nBUSTED: Trump-Hating School Shooting Survivor Visited CNN HQ Before the Shooting; Ranted Live on CNN After\n\nThings keep getting stranger with young David Hogg.\n\nFirst, we learn the mainstream media’s school shooting darling is the son of an FBI agent (retired). Then he goes on television ranting against President Trump when the deadly Florida school shooting last week — it turns out — was more the fault of the FBI than anyone even close to the White House.\n\nHogg ranted live on CNN and CBS and all other networks as his anti-Trump and anti-GOP gun control comments went viral in the mainstream media vacuum.\n\nLiberal Nation applauded.\n\nBut now we learn Hogg was hanging out at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, GA sometime Before the school shooting. Before the shooting. Posing behind an news anchor desk? Perhaps Hogg’s career dream is to sign on with the network — a young Jake Tapper — as he has portrayed himself since the deadly shooting that claimed 17 students as a “student journalist and entrepreneur.”\n\nWelcome to the Big Leagues.\n\nThen after, Hogg goes on CNN live to rant about Trump and the conservatives.\n\nBeyond coincidence.\n\nHogg also likes to sport his CNN T-shirt to school and beyond.\n\nYou can cut the irony with a chainsaw it is so thick here.\n\nThe Deep State media strikes again.\n\nThe kid who has been running his mouth about how Donald Trump and the GOP are teaming to help murder high school kids by upholding the Second Amendment is the son of an FBI agent.\n\nDavid Hogg is a school shooting survivor in Florida. At least that is what the mainstream media has told us. We wouldn’t be surprised by anything involving the FBI at this point.\n\nFrom Deep State CBS News:\n\n“David Hogg was in school when the Parkland, Florida, shooting started. His father is a retired FBI agent, so he recognized immediately that this was a gun. Here’s what he did:”\n\nAnd while the media allowed Hogg to adorn us with his worldly teen views on the Constitution, they conveniently left out the part where the FBI was warned that the Florida school shooter had promised to shoot up a school — at least twice — long before the massacre that killed 17 students last week.\n\nIf Hogg knew the shooter would snap — as he and other students have professed — perhaps he could have told his father about it.\n\nOh but wait, his father was in the FBI.\n\nIt would not have mattered anyway.\n\nThat’s the funny thing about the limelight, kid.\n\nOften the lights can come crashing down on your head.\n\nHelp Support True Pundit’s Independent Voice by Contributing Today! $ Donation Amount: We can only deliver independent news & Intel with your support.

"Shaquille O’Neal Says: ‘Trump Is Possibly The Best President Of The President Of All Times Ever, He Is Not Afraid To…’\nRecently when he was asked about President Trump retweeting a couple of videos that made a big fuzz in the media, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) stated that Trump had “been one of the best presidents” he ever served under.\n\nO’Neal stated “I’m not aware of it. I don’t pay much attention to his tweets. I’ll say this for you. He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under.”\n\nAND THE REASONING IS, HE’S NOT AFRAID TO MAKE DECISIONS. HE’S NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON THE — THE BIG MOUTHS AROUND HERE.”\n\nO’Neal continued, “The president is smart, powerful and a good counterpuncher.I think he attacks anyone he perceives or believes is attacking him or the country.”\n\n“He should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.” O’Neal added.\n\n“THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO START FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH HIM INSTEAD OF CRITICIZING AND WASTING THEIR TIME ON STUPID THINGS.” HE CONCLUDED.\n\nAnd Also What Ken Langone told CNBC:\n\nIf President Donald Trump is able to keep defying expectations — like he did in the election — and push through legislative changes against great odds, he could go down as “one of our greatest presidents ever,” Ken Langone told CNBC on Monday.\n\nLangone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House.\n\nVoters are “fed up,” Langone said on “Squawk Box.” “They did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing,” and now want results, he said.\n\nLangone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. “We own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act].”\n\n“If you guys don’t get your guys into a room and say ‘Guys this is our moment.’ The American people will throw you out too, the next time,” he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on “Squawk Box.”\n\n“[Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents ever” if he’s able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said.\n\n“The American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they don’t want incremental change. They want major change,” said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companies\n\nThe Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOP’s border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.\n\n\n\nMany retailers are against the idea of taxing imports, saying it will force them to raise prices.\n\nBut Langone argued that retailers, like Home Depot, would be better off in the long term if they’re able to “think beyond the next quarter or the next six months.”\n\nLike this: Like Loading...","https://proconservativenews.com/shaquille-oneal-says-trump-is-possibly-the-best-president-of-the-president-of-all-times-ever-he-is-not-afraid-to/","1512946870.0"
"BREAKING: Bill O’Reilly In Critical Condition After Being Attacked By ‘Tolerant’ Liberals\nBill O’Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was approached by two women and three men who said they were “disgusted” by his behavior towards women at Fox News. O’Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That’s when the “tolerant” liberals got violent.\n\nOne of the men grabbed O’Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.\n\nO’Reilly was taken to St. Vincent’s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O’Reilly’s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.\n\nThe family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O’Reilly “got what he deserved” for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.\n\nLiberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment.

"First Indictment Issued In Russian Bribery Case Tied To Obama-Era Uranium One Deal\nWhile we were busy chasing the “S***hole” not-so-shiny object the press laid out for us on Friday, it is now discovered what the media was trying to distract us from! And it is HUGE!\n\nThe DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One Deal released on Friday. THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up. Unlike the leak with Manafort and his indictment (which had nothing to do with Russian collusion in the Trump campaign), America woke up to non-stop news about Manafort turning himself in. Click HERE to read more about that. Manafort has since sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nFast forward to today. Uranium One Deal has its FIRST INDICTMENT against Mark Lambert.\n\nMark Lambert of Maryland has been indicted for “allegedly paid bribes to a Russian Official so his Company could win highly sensitive nuclear fuel transportation contracts.”\n\nThe “11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.” This is serious. And it stems from Russian collusion in the Obama-era.\n\n“The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.”\n\nKUDOS to the Trump-era DOJ American’s can trust.\n\nThe hard working and honest DOJ team, under Jeff Sessions, made the announcement yesterday.\n\nThe team members are: Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBI’s Washington, D.C. Field Office, as mentioned in the DOJ statement.\n\nHere is the Statement Below:\n\nAn indictment against a former co-president of a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad, was unsealed today for his alleged role in a scheme that involved the bribery of an official at a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation.\n\nActing Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBI’s Washington, D.C. Field Office made the announcement.\n\nMark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged in an 11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.\n\nThe case against Lambert is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland.\n\nAccording to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.\n\nIn order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.T\n\nhe indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services.\n\nIn June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing. The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.\n\nThe charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n\nThe case is being investigated by DOE-OIG and the FBI. Assistant Chiefs Ephraim Wernick and Christopher J. Cestaro and Trial Attorney Derek J. Ettinger of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorneys David I. Salem and Michael T. Packard of the District of Maryland, are prosecuting the case.\n\nThe Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs has provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Switzerland, Latvia and Cyprus for providing valuable assistance with the investigation and prosecution of the case.\n\nThe Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters.

"Denzel Washington: ‘Criminal-In-Chief’ Obama ‘Tore Heart Out Of America’\nFormer president Barack Obama ran the United States “like a banana republic” as “criminal-in-chief” and enriched himself and his cronies at the expense of the rest of the country, according to Denzel Washington.\n\n“Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic,” said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film, the legal drama “Roman J.

They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics?” Denzel Washington said, explaining that he had seen “a CNN segment about Obama’s legacy that blew my mind and left me raging.”\n\n“There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol?”\n\n“The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet.”\n\n“Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy.”\n\nThe Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were “groomed by the Obamas” with “invitations to parties in the White House, black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn”, he wasn’t extended the same treatment.\n\n“He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him.”\n\n“Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isn’t what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power?”\n\nAddressing the reporters personally, Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues.\n\n“Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out.

"White House Admits Syria Missile Attack Was A Publicity Stunt Aimed To Make Trump Look Good\nAs if things weren’t bad enough, senior White House officials openly admitted that the chemical strike against Syria had no actual purpose–the intention was to make it seem as though Trump is doing something for America. The attack was not part of a more in-depth strategy or part of an effort to remove Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Instead, the missile strike was a meaningless attempt to distract us from the real issue that’s right in our backyards: Donald J. Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN’s Jim Acosta reported on Twitter:\n\n“Senior administration official: Strike should not be interpreted as beginning of wider campaign to weaken or remove Assad.”\n\nSenior administration official: Strike should not be interpreted as beginning of wider campaign to weaken or remove Assad. — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) April 7, 2017\n\nHe followed up with:\n\n“Official adds mission was about demonstrating “unacceptability”\n\nOfficial adds mission was about demonstrating “unacceptability” of Assad’s actions. https://t.co/gr0Zjtiifb — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) April 7, 2017\n\nSo in other words, there was no thought or plan put into this strike. This was Trump’s way of saying “hey, look what I can do.”\n\nTrump just spent our valuable resources on a mission with no plot or end point just to make himself look presidential. Evidently, Trump picked his own ego over our country.

"BREAKING: Over 500 ‘Migrant Caravaners’ Arrested With Suicide Vests\nOver 500 members of the “Migrant Caravan,” a massive collection of refugees and immigrants moving towards our southern border, have been arrested by Mexican authorities after an early morning raid on their camp. According to Eduardo El Guapo Cardinal, his troops went tent by tent, waking the occupant when something fishy was found:\n\n“What we found were more than 500 ISIS soldiers posing as ‘immigrants’ fast asleep with their suicide belts right next to them. We’re lucky nobody was blown up in the raid.”\n\nAnother 10-20K “refugees” are expected to show up to apply for asylum in the next day or two. How many of them will be wearing a suicide vest?\n\nIt is well-known that people with brown skin tend to be able to blend in with others that look like them. These “refugees” are supposedly from Central America, somewhere just south of Brazil, so the Middle-Eastern men just have to shave their jihad beards and separate their unibrows to fit in.\n\nPresident Trump is calling the mission by the Mexicans “proof that those people are up to no good.” He added that they also would have been caught weeks ago had Mexico stayed out of our way. This is what happens when you don’t support President Trump.","https://dailyworldupdate.us/2018/05/01/breaking-over-500-migrant-caravaners-arrested-with-suicide-vests/#snopes/","1525147200.0"

"NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is ‘Rigged’, Found Dead\nAn NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is “rigged.”\n\nDan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an “gangland-style execution”, hours after blowing the whistle on the “rigged Super Bowl” backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.\n\nEarly reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.\n\nGoodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League’s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday’s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.\n\nHowever Goodes went “off-script” in Minneapolis and was “physically removed” from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as “totally corrupt” and claiming the Super Bowl is “fixed.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTelling reporters that he is a “football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second”, Goodes said “Football in America in 2018 doesn’t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.\n\n“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.\n\n“Football in America won’t recover from this.”\n\nEarly reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.\n\nAccording to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.\n\n“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”\n\n“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.“\n\n“You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”\n\n“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”\n\nExplaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”\n\nThe NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.\n\nIn a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.\n\nThe only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.\n\nHow are games rigged?\n\nAccording to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.\n\n“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed?\n\n“Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? I’m telling you now, they don’t care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes?”\n\n“The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes.”\n\n“How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games?”\n\n“Everyone is on the same side, that’s why.”\n\n“These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They can’t open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast.”\n\nWhy doesn’t anyone speak out?\n\nAccording to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear.\n\n“Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed.\n\n“It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl.”\n\n“And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. “We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. We’re exempt.”\n\nSuper Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.","http://econewsmedia.org/2018/02/01/nfl-lawyer-claimed-super-bowl-rigged-found-dead/","1517461200.0"
"Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network\nFox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network\n\nUPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.\n\nDuring a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic 'clear recovery,' someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.\n\nWhen host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll – one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.\n\nNot surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.\n\nKurtz quickly said, 'This is not the graphic we're looking for – hold off.

"BREAKING: Obama Caught On Open Mic Being A Racist After MLK Day Address\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 8.3k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nPresident Obama’s address to a crowd in Washington DC this morning was pretty inspirational. You could tell that his speechwriters worked hard putting these words on the teleprompter for him to recite as though he believed it:\n\n“Celebrate Martin Luther King Day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for. Honor him for being the great man that he was.”\n\nHis “tribute couldn’t possibly have been more canned or heartless. After the address, while the crowd was less than eagerly clapping, Obama shook hands with a man we’ve become all -too familiar with, Reverend Al Sharpton, not realizing his mic was still live. The sound man cut out the last few words when he figured out what was going on, but before that, a large number of people in the crowd heard Obama say to Sharpton:\n\n“These crackers got no idea what it’s like to feel the struggle. Speakin’ of, how you gonna keep all your n*ggas in line while whitey Trump rules the roost?”\n\nSeveral people booed Obama, who turned with a laugh to make it look like it was all just a big joke. America isn’t buying it. Since the incident, Obama’s approval rating has dropped to just above 1 percent with white, Christian males aged 18-24 from below the Mason-Dixon line, proving that the “racism” he thinks he’s a victim of is actually just a cultural thing. Southern white boys don’t like black fellas. That’s not racism, it’s just a fact.\n\nDonald Trump was asked about the incident. He said:\n\nThat’s why he’ll never win over my African Americans. More of them voted for me than voted for Lioncoln, did you know that? And, Lincoln was a Republican. This guy doesn’t understand what real racism is until he sees the thugs in the black communities hanging out in the streets just waiting to commit crimes. “\n\nIt’s no wonder Trump didn’t want to rent to them in the 1980s. Times were different back then. Nowadays you need to come up with excuses that can get past the courts to refuse to rent to them. It’s OK. Trump will make America great again and landlords will get their houses back.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-obama-caught-on-open-mic-being-a-racist-after-mlk-day-address/","1484596175.0"
"Study: Women with Natural Hair Have Low Self-Esteem\nAccording to research by cosmetic company Bountiful Hair, women with natural hair have lower self-esteem than women with treated hair.\n\nAccording to BlackHair.com, natural hair is “hair whose texture hasn’t been altered by chemical straighteners, including relaxers and texturizers.”\n\nThe most common natural hairstyle is an afro, which many black women consider an undesirable look. The hair is many times matted and coarse, and is not considered appropriate for a business environment. Many employers consider the look untidy, and ban individuals from wearing this style.\n\nAccording to the study by Bountiful Hair, natural hair being viewed as a messy look is causing many women, who wear their hair in that manner, to feel inadequate and less desirable as their counterparts. Those feelings of inadequacy causes women with natural hair to lash out at women with treated or straightened hair, and in turn lowers their self-esteem.\n\nOf the 3,000 women who participated in the study, 2,500 said they did not feel as pretty as women with straightened hair. Pilar Ciara Jones, who says she participated in the study, stated, “some days I just don’t know what to do with these naps — and on those days I just avoid the mirror altogether.”\n\n“I try to tell myself that wearing my hair natural is all about empowerment and expressing natural beauty, but there were times when I just did not feel pretty,” Jones continued. “When you continuously break combs because your hair is so nappy, and you use everything in your refrigerator to try to tame that mane, and you still have hair so rough you could polish rocks, you begin to reevaluate your choices.”\n\n“At one point I was using a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs on my hair every day to try to soften it. That’s when I knew it was time to make a change. I got a relaxer and a Brazilian weave down to my butt, and I have never felt prettier,” Jones stated.\n\nBountiful Hair says the feelings by Jones are common among women with natural hair.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.thenewsnerd.com/local/study-women-with-natural-hair-have-low-self-esteem/","1426978592.0"
"Holistic Doctor, Working Against Big Pharma, Shot Dead By Police\nAustralian holistic healer and former veterinarian, Dr. Justine Damond, has been shot dead by Minneapolis police, as the community of physicians seeking to operate outside the confines of Big Pharma continues to be decimated.\n\nDr. Damond, 40, was killed while standing in her pajamas outside the Minneapolis house owned by her partner. She had previously called 911 to report an intruder in the alley outside the house, however when police arrived they shot several times at the holistic doctor and killed her.\n\nAccording to reports, the police who arrived (including the one who shot her) had their body cameras turned off.\n\nThe well-known health and lifestyle coach, who was actively campaigning for people to take control of their lives and reject Big Pharma’s crippling products, joins the long list of holistic doctors and healers who have been killed in suspicious or unsolved circumstances during the past two years.\n\nHer partner, Don Damond, said he was being kept in the dark about the incident.\n\n“Sadly, her family and I have been provided with almost no additional information from law enforcement regarding what happened after police arrived,” Don Damond told reporters outside their home in suburban Fulton on Monday local time.\n\n“We have lost the dearest of people and we are desperate for information.”\n\nHe said Damond’s death was a loss to everyone who knew her.\n\nQuotes from people who were troubled by the killing:\n\n“Absolutely (she made a difference to a lot of lives), especially ours. We have had a joyous relationship with her up until now.”\n\n“We will remember her for her energy, her intelligence and the joy she brought to our lives.”\n\n“I am happy to have known Justine and her untimely, tragic death is a reminder to live life fully, love deeply, and take risks to love as we are not promised tomorrow.”\n\nHealth Nut News reports: Originally trained as a veterinarian, Justine also studied and practiced yoga and meditation for over 17 years, was a qualified yoga instructor, and a personal health and life coach.\n\nOn LinkedIn, the former veterinarian defined herself as “A Speaker, Coach & Consultant for Neuroscience & Meditation Based Change Initiatives.”\n\nHer interest in supporting people to heal and transform themselves developed after she saw family members suffer greatly from depression, alcoholism, and cancer. And so, after losing much of her family to cancer, she spent many years on a personal investigative journey to discover how habits and disease develop.\n\n“Two officers responded to a 911 call about a possible assault in the alley off of West 51st Street between Washburn and Xerxes avenues around 11.30pm, according to a statement released Sunday by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.”\n\nMinneapolis mayor Betsy Hodges claims that they will get to the bottom of why the officers’ body cameras were not turned on, “As mayor of our city, a wife, and a grandmother, I am heartsick and deeply disturbed by what occurred last night.”\n\nThe local community has been upset by the incident, and rightfully so. We are so sorry for the family’s loss and hope the investigation will wrap up soon so that they may have closure.\n\nWe’ve lost so many holistic healers and doctors in just two short years.","http://yournewswire.com/holistic-doctor-pharma-shot-dead/","1500349487.0"

"CDC Doctor: ‘Disastrous’ Flu Shot Is Causing Deadly Flu Outbreak\nA CDC doctor has warned this year’s “disastrous” flu shot may be responsible for the deadly flu epidemic sweeping the country.\n\n“Some of the patients I’ve administered the flu shot to this year have died,” the doctor said, adding “I don’t care who you are, this scares the crap out of me.”\n\n“We have seen people dying across the country of the flu, and one thing nearly all of them have in common is they got the flu shot.”\n\nScientists were worried this year’s flu season was going to be rough and their fears have been proven well founded. The flu season is off to a record-breaking start, with the CDC reporting widespread flu activity from coast to coast. Many health officials believe that 2018 will ultimately be the worst flu outbreak that we have experienced since 1918.\n\nThe CDC doctor’s experience of patients dying of the flu after receiving the flu shot is sadly not uncommon. Eight Santa Barbara County residents have died from the flu in the last fortnight. Seven of them had the flu shot.\n\nThis deadly pattern is replicating itself across the country. Yet health officials are still telling people to get the flu shot, even though it does not work well this season. Health officials have started admitting that the vaccine is only 10% effective.\n\nThe verdict is out on flu shots. Many medical experts now agree it is more important to protect yourself and your family from the flu vaccine than the flu itself.\n\nEvery year the pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media work hard to convince us to get vaccinated against the flu. 2018 is no different. But, as usual, we’re not being told the whole story.\n\nPharmaceutical companies provide mainstream media outlets with a huge percentage of their advertising revenue. Big pharmaceutical companies actually spend far more on advertising than research. We are talking hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nBig Pharma’s dollars have effectively purchased the silence of mainstream media. You can no longer believe anything they say about pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines.\n\nIt is clear Big Pharma is desperate to ensure mainstream media outlets never tell us about adverse reactions or the toxic chemicals being injected into us in the flu shot.\n\nFlu vaccines contain dangerous ingredients\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media admit to us that flu vaccines contain strains of the flu virus. What they are less likely to reveal though is the long list of other ingredients that come with the vaccine.\n\nIt is now a known fact that flu vaccines contain mercury, a heavy metal known to be hazardous for human health. Mercury toxicity can cause depression, memory loss, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory problems, ADD, oral health problems, digestive imbalances and other serious health issues.\n\nThe flu vaccines actually do not immunize but sensitize the body against the virus\n\nHave you ever noticed how vaccinated children get sick almost immediately following a vaccination?\n\nThis is because the flu virus is introduced into their bodies. So rather than immunize, the flu shot actually only sensitizes the body against the virus.\n\nAnd the fact that it causes individuals to get ill following a shot indicates immuno-suppression (i.e. lowering of the immunity).\n\nMakes you more susceptible to pneumonia and other contagious diseases\n\nFor someone with an already suppressed immune system, injecting strains of the flu virus can have devastating consequences.\n\nIf your body is already working to fight off a virus or simply operating with low immunity, a vaccine injection could put your body in serious danger of contracting influenza with stronger symptoms, or even worse pneumonia and other contagious diseases.\n\nWeakens immunological responses\n\nThere have been literally thousands of medical journal articles published that show injecting vaccines can lead to harmful immunological responses and a host of other infections. Moreover, weak immunological responses only decrease a person’s ability to fight the diseases that the vaccine was supposed to protect against in the first place.\n\nSerious neurological disorders\n\nEvidence now suggests that ingredients in flu vaccinations can actually cause serious neurological disorders. In 1976 a significant number of those who received the flu vaccine acquired Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a disorder characterized by permanent nerve damage and even paralysis.\n\nFlu vaccines can contain many harmful materials including detergent, mercury, formaldehyde, and strains of live flu virus.\n\nShould you get a flu shot? If you are still prevaricating, and wondering who to trust, consider this:\n\nThe very people pushing flu vaccinations, and putting the fear of God into anybody who abstains, are making billions of dollars each year.\n\nAre they the people we should be trusting with our health?\n\nIn August 1999, the Committee on Government Reform initiated an investigation into Federal vaccine policy. This investigation focused on possible conflicts of interest on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe investigation concluded that many individuals serving on two key advisory committees had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines.\n\nOften, these individuals were granted waivers to fully participate in the discussions that led to recommendations on vaccine licensing and adding vaccines to the Childhood Immunization Schedule.\n\nThis in itself creates serious doubt as to how effective flu vaccines really are.","http://yournewswire.com/cdc-flu-shot-deadly-outbreak/","1516037555.0"

It happened right before Christmas and it involved young children. The New World Order wants to disarm the American people. That's why they created all of these hoax shootings. Every disarmament by the government is followed by a genocide of the citizens. This happened with the Bolsheviks in Russia. This also happened in China, Vietnam, and Nazi Germany. Once the citizens are disarmed they are helpless sheep. Europe has already been disarmed now their coming for Americans guns. Don't give up your guns. After each one of these fake shootings go buy another gun. Obama was the best gun salesman in history. These fake shootings go back to Columbine High School, Sandy Hook, and Aurora movie theater shooting. The Dylann Roof church shooting was fake. The Pulse Nightclub was fake. The Texas church shooting was fake. The Las Vegas shooting was fake. The most recent school shooting in Florida was fake. I may have forgot some of them. But you get the point these were all done by our own government with the intention of taking away our 2nd Amendment rights. This information needs to be revealed to all of the American people.

"Conway Calls To Prohibit Golden State From Winning The Championship Unless They Come Celebrate In The White House “Like The Law Says”\nShaun Livingston said months ago, if the Warriors won the title, he wouldn’t visit Donald Trump’s White House. He’s unsurprisingly not alone in that thinking. Golden State coach Steve Kerr has called Donald Trump’s policies un-American. Stephen Curry essentially called the American president an a*s. David West said Trump’s approach is the opposite of what the forward teaches youth. But this level of unified decision-making was still somewhat surprising to see after the Warriors clinched the 2017 NBA title. This isn’t the first time players faced that conflict – participating in a photo op with someone whose policies and rhetoric you find reprehensible vs. respecting the office of the presidency – though, they have usually sided with respecting the office and getting the experience of a lifetime.\n\nMeanwhile, counselor to U.S. President, Kellyanne Conway is at it again. In an interview with Minnesota’s KYSP Radio, she argued that the news of the Warriors’ refusal to visit the White House in a celebratory fashion is “a disrespectful act” and something you just don’t turn down. “First of all, I have to mention that I was going to congratulate the team for their win, but then I realized I’d be acting against my position by doing so. That’s the first thing. The second thing, I mean, I understand that everyone has the right to free will and all that, but everybody knows that an invite to visit the White House is a privilege not many are granted. It’s just one of those things you don’t turn down. So, to do something like this, and publicly, it’s a scandal,” she said.\n\nShe continued, “One could almost say it’s a rule. As a matter of fact, you know something? I’m just going to go out there and say it: it’s a law. And though I know it’s not really a law, I’m going to make sure to make it one. Because, it’s not about who the president is; the guy’s in there only temporarily. It’s about the structure, the space, the history within it and, ultimately, the honor of being inside a place where so many decisions took place; decisions that shaped the world as we know it. Ugh, I’m getting goosebumps just thinking about it. I can’t even begin to describe how I felt when I visited it for the first time. The Warriors don’t realize it yet, but they’re looking at this all wrong.”\n\n“That’s exactly why I plan to do everything in my power to make sure Golden State is prohibited from winning the championship, formally speaking, unless they agree to come and celebrate in the White House. That’s the rule – or the law, whichever one you prefer – because I refuse to let this privilege be smeared by a group of so-called athletes who are such prima donnas that they can’t fathom being a part of something greater than their own puny achievements. Winning the NBA is done by a different team every year; but, there’s only one White House. That’s the gameplay, fellas. I hope I made it clear enough for you,” she concluded.\n\nSource:Politicass.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/06/15/conway-calls-prohibit-golden-state-winning-championship-unless-come-celebrate-white-house-like-law-says/","1497499200.0"
"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS\nMaxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant.

She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.\n\nThankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.\n\nStill, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.\n\nCome to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!\n\nSources: Teddy Stick – 1tch","https://teddystick.com/democrat-maxine-waters-has-shown-up-to-only-10-of-congressional-meetings-for-35-years/","1496856673.0"

That is your God given right,” said Justin Timberlake, while readying himself for his long-awaited Super Bowl Halftime show appearance. “If everyone took care of their own children, we wouldn’t have to worry about taking care of the herd, or making anything mandatory, or any of that communist stuff.”\n\n“I’d also like to know,” continued the Cry Me A River hitmaker, “why a child who has been ‘immunized’ is not actually immune to the disease… Why are these kids are always catching the very disease they are supposedly immune to?… and they spread these diseases too…”\n\n“And yet sanctimonious parents of immunized kids, they get on their soap box and say my unvaccinated child is a threat to their child? Get a grip already. Isn’t your child supposed to be immune?”\n\nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel sparked controversy in 2015 when they refused to vaccinate their son, Silas, citing health concerns.\n\nTimberlake is far from the only celebrity in the music business who believes mandatory vaccinations are unsafe.

"Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby\n9.6k SHARES Share Tweet Share\n\nDe Soto, Missouri – Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave.\n\nAccording to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the family’s living room.\n\nMoments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave.\n\nThe 16-year-old babysitter named ‘Anna Ritchie’, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness.\n\n“I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Robert. “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events.\n\nThe 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.\n\n“Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.\n\nThe state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.","https://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/","1453391265.0"

"New Fuel Crystal OBL Will Replace Gasoline\nFrom the desk of a U.S. State Department Energy Advisor:\n\nThis Breakthrough\n\n'Superfuel' is 1,693X More Powerful Than Gasoline\n\nUnearthed in the Andes Mountains, these mysterious crystals contain\n\nwhat MIT researchers call energy's 'Holy Grail.'\n\nAnd they could ignite a $7.2 trillion economic revolution!\n\nA discovery made 13,000 feet up in the Andes Mountains is going to forever alter the global energy industry.\n\nTake a look at this picture.\n\nThe locals call the mysterious crystals you see here 'Oro Blanco.'\n\nTranslated, that's 'White Gold.'\n\nHowever, Goldman Sachs has a different name for it.\n\n'The new gasoline.'\n\n– Goldman Sachs\n\nBut that may very well be the understatement of the century.\n\nYou see, Oro Blanco is 1,693-times more powerful than the gasoline that runs your car.\n\nWhich is why Goldman Sachs is predicting it will eventually 'replace gasoline as the primary source of transportation fuel.'\n\nBut MIT, Forbes, and The Daily Mail have made an even bolder declaration.\n\n'The Holy Grail'\n\n– MIT, Forbes, The Daily Mail\n\nThey believe unlocking this crystal fuel's potential is akin to discovering 'The Holy Grail.'\n\nAnd in a few moments, you are going to agree with them.\n\nEspecially, if you decide to become one of the early investors who get in on the ground floor of this energy source.\n\nBecause it's set to create a new generation of millionaires.\n\nAnd you could be one of them.\n\nNow before we delve into this amazing situation, I need to tell you something.\n\nAnd it might give you a temporary case of sticker shock.\n\nThis superfuel will run you $49 a gallon.\n\nAt first it sounds pricey.\n\nBut Oro Blanco, what I call 'OBL,' is actually one of the greatest bargains you'll ever come across.\n\nCheck this out.\n\nLet's say you own a typical mid-sized American car.\n\nSo you can probably drive about 25 miles on a gallon of gasoline.\n\nMaybe 40-50 if it's a hybrid-electric model like a Toyota Prius.\n\nCare to guess what would happen if you retrofitted your car to run on OBL?\n\n50 miles to the gallon? Maybe 100 MPG? Or 500 MPG?\n\nNot even close.\n\nI'd like for you to imagine:\n\nPulling into your local gas station on empty\n\nPutting only a single gallon of this superfuel in your tank\n\nAnd driving 42,325 miles before having to stop at that same gas station again .\n\nThat's like driving from New York City to Los Angeles and back SEVEN times on a single gallon.\n\nSo you're probably asking yourself, 'how is this even possible?'\n\nI'll give you two reasons.\n\nOne of them is simple science. And the other sounds like magic.\n\nFirst off, this crystal fuel can withstand extreme temperatures.\n\nConsider gasoline.\n\nIt might start boiling at 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhen it does, some amounts will evaporate.\n\nThat's potential fuel that is vanishing into thin air.\n\nOBL doesn't have this problem.\n\nIt doesn't boil until it hits 2,457 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSo it utilizes its full energy potential, while remaining stable at temperatures much higher than any car engine can produce.\n\nNow, the second reason.\n\nThis is the secret that gives these tiny crystals the ability to contain such an immense amount of energy.\n\nAstrophysicists have observed 'OBL' being produced by dwarf stars and cosmic rays colliding.\n\nThe explosion is so intense, it causes the stars to burn up to 100,000 times brighter than they did before.\n\nIt also sets off a Galactic process known as stellar nucleosynthesis, which gives birth to this superfuel.\n\nNow obviously, if this was the only way in which OBL formed, we'd be fresh out of luck.\n\nAfter all, mining asteroids and energy exploration missions in outer space are a ways off.\n\nFortunately, here on earth, OBL is created by another violent event.\n\nThe collision of tectonic plates deep in our planet's crust.\n\nThese seismic forces produce a mysterious crystallized substance that is very powerful and very rare.\n\nIt's present in just .0007% of the earth's crust.\n\nAnd only under perfect conditions is it able to make the journey to the surface.\n\nWhich is why it primarily exists in the Andes Mountains.\n\nIn very acute areas of this region, tectonic plates will shift, twisting the ground above like a wrung towel and leaching a liquefied mixture of OBL through the rocks.\n\nIt then bubbles up and settles into hydrothermal pools.\n\nOver time, the arid climate will cause the water in these celestial ponds to evaporate.\n\nAnd what's left behind is OBL.\n\nIt is so light that it floats on water.\n\nIt's so soft that it can be cut with a butter knife.\n\nAnd its 'energy density' is unrivaled.\n\nHere's a way to understand this.\n\nJust imagine every solar installation that currently exists in every country.\n\nsolar installation that currently exists in country. Now imagine multiplying those installations by 1,000.\n\nIn one year's time, OBL could double that total energy production .\n\nThis is why the titans of industry are now rushing to secure strategic reserves.\n\nRecently, every major auto manufacturer has journeyed to the Andes Mountains.\n\nThey're waging what the locals call:\n\n'La Guerra.'\n\nTranslation: The War over OBL.\n\nAnd the battle lines are being drawn.\n\nVolkswagen has announced plans to produce two-to-three million cars per year… all powered by this crystal fuel.\n\nFord's CEO, Mark Fields, wants to convert almost HALF of his fleet to run on it.\n\nChevy, Honda, Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln – you name it.\n\nExperts now believe 'OBL' will soon power 35 out of every 100 new cars…\n\nAnd it will add half a trillion dollars in new revenue to the auto industry virtually overnight.\n\nSo with every major car company fighting to secure as much of this rare substance as they can, 'La Guerra' is heating up.\n\nAnd they're not just competing with each other!\n\nThe applications of OBL go far beyond the automotive industry.\n\nIn short, OBL is a 'universal fuel.' It can be used for everything. And it will soon be everywhere.\n\nThis year it was announced 'OBL' will become the fuel of the international space station. And it won't need a refill until at least 2024.\n\nThe Pentagon has categorized it as a 'strategic' fuel. And because it's a critical element in our most advanced weaponry, military stockpiles have been classified a 'state secret.'\n\nOBL is also in the early stages of being integrated into the U.S. electrical grid. It is so efficient that it would take less than six cement trucks-worth to power the ENTIRE country during peak hours.\n\nEven cellphone manufacturers are now planning to use OBL-enhanced technology to power tens of millions of mobile devices. This crystal fuel will enable them to transmit signals 30-times farther and 1,000-times faster.\n\nThis superfuel could also make the United States' dream of complete energy independence a reality.\n\nScientists have developed a way for OBL to exponentially increase the power production of every domestic energy source.\n\nThat includes oil, natural gas, solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, hydro… all of the above and more.\n\nAnd as you're about to see, even though the hotbed for this crystal fuel is in the Andes Mountains, it's the United States that has outmaneuvered other nations to control it.\n\nWe're going to be the biggest benefactors.\n\nAnd it's going to put complete energy independence within our grasp.\n\nNow, as you can imagine, this has sent shockwaves throughout the ranks of the OPEC cartel.\n\nThe oil derricks that span the deserts of the Middle East have lined the pockets of sheiks and the Saudi Royal Family with untold riches for decades.\n\nBut according to reports from media outlets like CNBC, whoever controls OBL will be able to form 'the new OPEC.'\n\nSo the Kingdom has been forced into a desperate game of catch up.\n\nSaudi Arabia has partnered with Japan's SoftBank in a massive joint venture.\n\nIt's launching this year with $20 billion earmarked for OBL technology.\n\nBut American companies have already beat them to the punch.\n\nGoogle was one of the first to capitalize on this energy phenomenon.\n\nThe search giant has 61,814 employees in offices spanning every major country.\n\nAnd Google has plotted out a $1.8 billion plan to independently produce 100% of its own energy.\n\nOBL is a central piece of this plan.\n\nWalmart is undertaking a similar mission… and is projecting to SAVE as much as $1 billion per year !\n\nApple has put up $1 billion with the hope of using OBL-powered technology to save many, many times that amount.\n\nSo has Total S.A., one of the top 10 largest oil companies in the world.\n\nBut these four giants aren't alone…\n\nFacebook\n\nAmazon\n\nAT&T\n\nCostco\n\nTarget\n\nKaiserPermanente\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nFedEx\n\nThey are all making major investments in OBL-related initiatives.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the richest and most famous businessmen are getting in for a different reason…\n\nOBL's nearly unlimited profit potential !\n\nTake Peter Thiel.\n\nThiel is the famed venture capitalist behind Facebook and PayPal. And today he's President Donald Trump's tech advisor.\n\nIt was recently announced that Thiel's firm led a $15 million investment in an OBL technology start-up.\n\nWarren Buffett, Elon Musk, and Sir James Dyson are all vying to win the race for this superfuel as well.\n\nBut they're going to face stiff competition from other members of the billionaire's club.\n\nBill Gates and his friends just anteed up…\n\nand their opening bet is $1 billion!\n\nGates has assembled a veritable All-Star team of successful entrepreneurs who are pushing their financial muscle into OBL-related ventures.\n\nHe's partnered with:\n\nJeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world's most successful hedge fund\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook\n\nRichard Branson, founder of Virgin Group\n\nJack Ma, Executive Chairman of Alibaba Group\n\nReid Hoffman, Co-founder of LinkedIn\n\nMeg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard\n\nMarc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com\n\nMichael Bloomberg, CEO of Bloomberg\n\nHasso Plattner, Co-founder of SAP\n\nGeorge Soros, Chairman of Soros Fund Management\n\nTogether they're putting up $1 billion just to kick things off.\n\nBut they aren't even the biggest group that's angling to make a killing from this superfuel .\n\nAn international group called Mission Innovation will be investing $30 billion a year by 2021.\n\nIn short, an incredible amount of capital is going into rapidly expanding innovations that will require OBL.\n\nThis is where it gets really interesting for you…\n\nDespite the massive investments starting to pour in, OBL is still a tiny player on the energy scene.\n\nThe entire industry accounts for only $29 billion.\n\nTo put it another way, currently the worldwide market for OBL is one-twelfth the size of just one oil company – Exxon.\n\nBut that's about to change in a BIG way.\n\nThis $29 billion market is on the verge of exploding to $7.2 trillion!\n\nThat's based on projections by the International Energy Agency.\n\nAhead :\n\nThe OBL Treasure Trove That is Going to Mint Millionaires! Outside of a Ghost Town in Death Valley, an amazing OBL discovery has been unearthed. Potentially valued at $20.4 billion, this could make some very lucky people very rich. And time is running out to partner with the tiny miner that has secured the rights to this treasure!\n\nSo we're potentially looking at an incredible 24,728% growth rate!\n\nWhich makes its nickname 'White Gold' even more fitting.\n\nHowever, this superfuel is quickly becoming more valuable than all of the 'real gold' in the world.\n\nAnd a breaking development in this story could deliver you a once-in-a-lifetime windfall.\n\nAs I mentioned, ever since it was first discovered, one of the only places on earth known to contain high accumulations of OBL was 13,000 feet up in the Andes Mountains.\n\nBut a tiny miner has just stumbled upon a treasure trove of it, spread across seven deposits right here in the United States .\n\nAnd they've recently secured the rights to this 15,000-acre discovery.\n\nIt's a desolate place, located hundreds of miles from the nearest city, where the natural conditions just happen to be perfect for OBL to form.\n\nTo be clear, ONE tiny $92 million company has positioned itself to control the booming OBL market in the United States.\n\nAnd their single discovery could be worth 225X more than their current market cap.\n\nThis is a quickly developing situation.\n\nSo I'm going to give you the full scoop.\n\nRecently, the insiders at this company started buying up all the shares they can.\n\nThey know what's coming.\n\nAnd it's critical that you learn how to stake your claim, while this microcap stock is still trading for around $1.50 a share.\n\nIt's dirt cheap.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the more you can allocate to this opportunity the better.\n\nBecause you're about to see how this miner could make you 1,233% over the next year .\n\nHowever, if you extend your horizon a little bit, this 1,233% windfall could turn into a torrent of money.\n\nYou might even be able to add another '0' to that payday… 12,330%!\n\nBut before I go any further, you should probably know who I am.\n\nMy name is Dr. Kent Moors. And I've lived what some might call a very interesting life.\n\nFor the last four decades, I've worked for the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nMany of my missions in Vietnam, behind enemy lines in the Soviet Union, and especially those I've conducted recently, are still classified to this day.\n\nHowever, I can tell you that I have earned three Presidential Citations from Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton.\n\nAnd hanging in my office are 23 commendations from the U.S. Intelligence Community – including the intelligence equivalent of the Medal of Honor.\n\nMy sensitive work has helped me develop connections.\n\nConnections that placed me atop two State Department task forces.\n\nConnections that have made me a consultant to the IEA, EIA, and OPEC.\n\nConnections that have made me an energy policy advisor to 9 oil majors, as well as 29 governments around the world.\n\nIn fact, the U.S., the U.K., Russia, China, Iraq, Australia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan are just a few of the nations that turn to me.\n\nBottom line: I'm the guy who gets deals done.\n\nWhen an old friend of mine, who also happened to be the former President of OPEC, needed to ensure a $13 billion oil refinery deal went smoothly, he called me to make that happen.\n\nAnd I did.\n\nWhen one of my contacts wanted access to 393 million barrels of oil reserves in Argentina, he sent me in to investigate this $40 billion project.\n\nAnd it was a success.\n\nWhen Sinopec, China's $8 billion energy titan, wanted a piece of $2 trillion worth of unconventional oil claims in Pennsylvania and Wyoming, their executives flew to my vacation home in the Bahamas.\n\nAnd we carefully mapped out this incredible international deal.\n\nWhen Former Polish President Lech Walesa wanted to build a strategy for easing energy conflicts between Eastern Europe and Russia, he came to me.\n\nAnd we plotted the best course of action together.\n\nI'm not telling you all of this to brag.\n\nBut so that you take everything I'm about to say very seriously.\n\nThis OBL situation is the most exciting energy development I've seen in my career.\n\nThis is one of those moments in time, where generational wealth is created.\n\nAnd you can get in on the ground floor.\n\nJust look at what's happening in the automotive industry.\n\nDemand for OBL in the car market is now set to rise by 310,000 metric tons per year.\n\nThat is eleven-times more than the total amount being produced today!\n\nNow consider this…\n\nThe billionaire CEO of just ONE prominent car company has already said that in order to meet his firm's OBL demand they 'need to absorb the entire world's production.'\n\nAnd, remember, it's not just the automotive industry fighting tooth and nail to get their hands on this stuff.\n\nSome of the largest and richest corporations – like Apple, Google, Amazon and Walmart – are planning to run their entire operations almost exclusively with OBL-enhanced systems.\n\nPlus, consortiums of the world's most successful billionaires are piling money into securing this superfuel .\n\nAnd there's precious little to go around!\n\nYou don't have to be a genius to know that with these levels of scarcity and demand…\n\nIf you control OBL, you can pretty much name your price .\n\nIn fact, the price of OBL going into last year doubled up to $13,000 per metric ton.\n\nAnd now it's closer to $25,000 .\n\nThat means, the price of OBL has doubled TWICE in the past 14 months.\n\nBut almost nobody knows about it… yet .\n\nAnd it just so happens that one little miner, led by the most successful management team I've ever seen, could dominate this soaring market…\n\nBecause they found a treasure trove of this rare substance – not high up in the Andes Mountains… but right here in America .\n\nThis $92 million miner recently acquired what could soon be considered the most valuable piece of land in the world.\n\nOpportunities like this come along, if you're lucky, once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nThis could be even bigger than the fracking boom.\n\nA few years ago, we all saw how the fracking revolution unlocked vast amounts of previously inaccessible oil and natural gas deposits in the U.S.\n\nIt minted millionaires overnight in places like North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nNow I believe this same story is beginning to play out again.\n\nOnly this time it's happening with OBL.\n\nOf course, there are no guarantees. But if it's anything like the last energy boom, one small investment could give you a legitimate shot at becoming a millionaire.\n\nThis tiny miner has discovered what appears to be THE MOTHER LODE of 'OBL'…\n\nAnd it's in our own backyard.\n\nThis discovery spans 15,000 acres.\n\nAnd it's situated in a windswept plane at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains where:\n\nContinental plates are colliding\n\nSending hot water boiling up through the cracks in the earth's crust\n\nAnd leaching this precious crystal into evaporating ponds in the desert, where it can be mined.\n\nCurrently there are seven known OBL-filled deposits lying just under the surface waiting to be extracted.\n\nThis company's own 'blind' estimates suggest the property's reserves could approach 816,000 metric tons.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has recently conducted no fewer than four studies in the region confirming this superfuel is there.\n\nAnd at $25,000 per metric ton…\n\nWe could be looking at a $20.4 billion OBL treasure trove!\n\nIt's literally beginning to burst out of the ground.\n\nAnd it's all controlled by this tiny $92 million company.\n\nRight now, this soon-to-be energy titan is building a facility to mine their OBL find.\n\nAnd the great thing is, they don't have to pave a single foot of road or pound even one railroad spike into the ground to move their stash.\n\nTheir discovery lies right in the middle of already functioning highway and railroad systems.\n\nSo it turns out that good fortune (along with brilliant management) is shining down on this diamond in the desert.\n\nBut if you wait until they put even one speck of OBL onto a train or 18-wheeler, you risk missing your chance at the kind of payday investors normally only dream about.\n\nNow, nothing in the market is guaranteed, and this is a small stock.\n\nIn fact, shares are only trading for about $1.50 – literally pocket change!\n\nAnd I'm expecting a major announcement that will send this stock to the moon, and enrich savvy investors.\n\nAs we speak, this firm is rushing to complete an important study that will confirm exactly how much OBL can be mined in the seven deposits under its newly acquired property .\n\nI believe the results will be announced within the next three months.\n\nPossibly within the next few weeks.\n\nRemember, there could be 816,000 metric tons of OBL in play, potentially worth $20 billion.\n\nThat would be a massive windfall for this $92 million company.\n\nIt would represent a 225X boost to their current market cap.\n\nAnd for years now, members of the 'dream team' behind this small firm have been repeatedly making early investors a fortune in similar ventures.\n\n'They are quite possibly the most successful resource team in modern history.'\n\nThe executive chairman is an entrepreneur, geochemist, and geologist with over 35 years in the mining industry.\n\nHe built his first company, a lithium miner, from the ground up and sold it two years later for near 1,500% gains .\n\nlater for . He then founded a uranium miner that he sold two years later for a 2,000% return .\n\nlater for . Then he took a potash mining operation from a market cap of $10 million up to $1.8 billion. This time he cashed out for a 4,000% payday in two and a half years .\n\nAnd with this OBL venture, he's teamed up with one of the world's most successful commodities billionaires .\n\nAnother energy mogul with an incredible track record.\n\nThis billionaire funded and developed a uranium miner that made early investors 6,950% .\n\n. He was one of the architects of a gold mining firm that delivered a 2,161% windfall.\n\nwindfall. He also backed a diamond miner when it was trading for $0.10 a share. A couple years later, it was trading for $200…\n\nThat's a nearly incomprehensible 199,900% payday!\n\nThis Mining Dream Team Has Already Delivered Once-in-a-Lifetime Windfalls…SIX TIMES!\n\nTo give you an understanding of how 'take it to the bank' successful these guys have been, consider this…\n\nIf you had somehow been able to invest just $500 into each of these six success stories, you could've cashed out with $1,085,555.\n\nObviously, these gains are definitely rare and exceptional.\n\nBut even a fraction of these returns could radically enhance your net worth.\n\nLook, I've facilitated energy deals between governments and companies of all sizes.\n\nAhead: This Tiny Miner's\n\nOther 'Secret'… Could transform a potential 1,233% windfall into 12,330%! Wait until you see this.\n\nThat includes consulting with 9 of the world's top 10 oil companies on deals worth millions .\n\nI've worked with the Bank of England and the Russian Central Bank on energy investments worth billions .\n\nAnd I've even advised Li Hui, an executive with China's largest oil company on $2 trillion worth of natural gas investments.\n\nIn my four decades in this industry, I've analyzed the management teams behind over 500 companies in the energy and commodities industries.\n\nAs a result, I understand the intricacies of the energy markets like no one else on the planet.\n\nAnd I've never seen so many massive gains pulled under one roof – many delivered within two years .\n\nNow, please mark my words.\n\nOnce the results from this miner's OBL study are made public, this $1.50 stock could easily jump to $20 per share.\n\nThat's enough to turn every $500 invested today into more than $6,600.\n\nHowever, they have another OBL secret up their sleeve that could, in a couple of years, add another '0' to that 1,233% windfall.\n\nTransforming it into an amazing 12,330% payday.\n\nThat means that same $500 could grow into over $62,167!\n\nI'm going to tell you about that in just a few moments.\n\nBut here's what you need to understand right now.\n\nTo put it bluntly, situations like this rarely present themselves.\n\nThis is a truly historic opportunity.\n\nAnd I want to show you how to capitalize on it.\n\nSo I've compiled all of my research into a special intelligence briefing called:\n\nThe 'White Gold' Rush: Capture a 12,330% Windfall From This Tiny Miner's OBL Treasure Trove!\n\nIn the old days, some folks were lucky enough to stumble upon a huge oil discovery on their farm.\n\nOthers braved harsh conditions to pan for gold and silver in the Yukon Territory.\n\nBut today with The 'White Gold' Rush in your hands, you can learn how to make one small investment, and from the comfort of your own home find yourself at the center of the most exciting treasure hunt in modern history.\n\nThis Could be the Beginning of a $7.2 Trillion Energy Dynasty.\n\nHere's How to Get in on the Ground Floor!\n\nIn The 'White Gold' Rush, I'm going to take you deep inside the OBL energy phenomenon.\n\nI'll show you how this superfuel forms in our solar system through a process known as stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nYou'll also see how it's created from the collision of tectonic plates beneath the earth's crust. I find this fascinating. And you will too.\n\nBut more important, this superfuel is going to make people a boatload of money.\n\nHave You Ever Transformed $500 into $62,167? The 'OBL' hidden in these celestial ponds could make that a reality!\n\nIn just the last fourteen months, the price of OBL has doubled… and then doubled again!\n\nBut that's just a drop in the bucket.\n\nWe're at the very early stages of this $29 billion market unleashing a $7.2 trillion energy revolution.\n\nEvery major player in technology, energy, and finance is essentially cutting blank checks to fund innovations that utilize OBL.\n\nIn fact, in nine years it's estimated that ALL new vehicles will run on OBL technology.\n\nBut fueling our cars is only one of the many uses being implemented. OBL is going to be everywhere.\n\nAnd those who control the sources of this superfuel now, are positioned to become millionaires in the very near future.\n\nAfter today, you could be one of those people.\n\nOutside a Death Valley Ghost Town, the 'White Gold' Mother Lode Has Been Unearthed.\n\nAnd I'm Going to Give You a Treasure Map with a Big Fat X Marked on it!\n\nA Potential $20 Billion\n\nTreasure Trove… Plant your flag now, and a fortune awaits you! This OBL discovery is 18 times bigger than Central Park in New York City. And it's so packed with this superfuel, it's bursting out of the ground. You could scoop it up with wheelbarrows! Or you could make a small investment in the miner that controls it and cash in BIG!\n\nThere are only a few places on the planet where OBL has been found. And each location is just as mysterious as the superfuel itself. But this discovery takes it to a new level.\n\nIt spans 15,000 acres in one of the most barren and uninhabitable areas of the United States – Death Valley. And the only trace of civilization is a long-abandoned Ghost Town that sits outside the property.\n\nBut it's here that the motherlode of OBL has been unearthed.\n\nAlready, the USGS has conducted countless studies of this region. And every one of them confirms the presence of massive amounts of OBL.\n\nSo in The 'White Gold' Rush, I will provide you with an exciting treasure map of this location.\n\nYou'll be briefed on each of its seven known OBL deposits.\n\nAnd when you hear how much this find could be worth, it's going to blow your mind.\n\nThis Death Valley discovery may be hiding 816,000 metric tons of OBL.\n\nAt current projections, this could be worth $20 billion.\n\nYet, a global shortage and feverish demand might just cause that number to double or triple!\n\nFortunately, with one small investment now, you can get a big piece of this treasure trove.\n\nAnd you'll be positioned for a once-in-a-lifetime payday!\n\n'A Dream Team' Controls This Legendary OBL Discovery! And You Can Join Them on Their Next Multi-Billion Dollar Venture!\n\nThis Dream Team's Death Valley Discovery Could Contain Enough OBL… …To Power the U.S. Electrical Grid For the Next 124 Years. So how long before this $1.50 stock could be trading for $20? According to my intel: Not long.\n\nThis story basically writes itself.\n\nA team of All-Star geologists and chemical engineers made this OBL discovery.\n\nThen they bought the land it's sitting on, and formed a tiny company.\n\nAs we speak, this mining firm has a market cap of only $92 million.\n\nAnd shares are trading for $1.50 apiece.\n\nThey are dirt cheap.\n\nSo you can load up on this stock for veritable pocket change.\n\nAnd that's exactly what I suggest you do.\n\nBecause this same team has an impossible to ignore track record of transforming their finds into mind-blowing windfalls.\n\nYour Partners Are the Very Definition of the Serially Successful! Lithium Miner: 1,500% windfall\n\nUranium Miner: 2,000% windfall\n\nPotash Miner: 4,000% windfall\n\nUranium Miner: 6,950% windfall\n\nGold Miner: 2,161% windfall\n\nDiamond Miner: 199,900% windfall In the The 'White Gold' Rush, you'll get the chance to take part in their next major discovery!\n\nIn recent years, they've built companies from scratch that became worth:\n\n$2.4 billion…\n\n$3.1 billion…\n\n$1.8 billion…\n\n$6.2 billion… Just to name a few.\n\nIn The 'White Gold' Rush I'm going to introduce you to each of the founders and top level execs.\n\nYou'll receive a deep briefing on their company.\n\nAnd I'll layout their plans for extracting this OBL treasure trove.\n\nBut you won't have to wait until their deposits start producing to reap the rewards.\n\nAs I'll explain, this small miner is set to make an announcement regarding the amount of OBL under their control.\n\nThis could happen in a matter of weeks or months.\n\nIf they confirm the initial projections and are sitting on 816,000 metric tons of this superfuel , their stock could rapidly shoot up 1,233%.\n\nBut this miner has another secret that could transform a 1,233% windfall into 12,330%!\n\nNow I have to admit, I've been holding something back from you.\n\nUp to this point, I've only told you about this miner's discovery in the United States.\n\nBut they have just secured another massive property that is bursting with OBL.\n\nAnd it's located far away, where the 'White Gold' story first began…the Andes Mountains.\n\nNestled between two areas menacingly known as Dead Man's Lake and Little Devil's Flats lies 20,000 acres of OBL-rich land.\n\nSo this miner's new discovery is bigger than the one they are also developing near Death Valley.\n\nIt also contains more OBL.\n\nAccording to a recent survey, this chunk of land holds over 2.8 million metric tons of this superfuel .\n\nThat equates to $70 billion of the most 'in-demand' energy source in the world.\n\nAs fast as the price of OBL has been going up, this could be the very definition of a conservative estimate.\n\nAnd just like with their U.S. property, this miner will have no problem bringing their treasure trove to market.\n\nThat's because the Andes Mountain location is also connected to railways and roads.\n\nAnd a thriving sea port nearby has ships ready to carry tons of OBL at the drop of a hat to an ever-growing number of desperate customers.\n\nThis superfuel discovery in the Andes Mountains is enough to enrich early investors all on its own.\n\nHistory has been pretty clear on this.\n\nWhenever a small miner finds OBL in the Andes Mountains, it makes a killing.\n\nFor instance, one OBL miner jumped 2,440 % in less than a year.\n\nAnother, 1,855% in two and a half months.\n\nAnd a third skyrocketed an incredible 1,191% in a little over two-and-a-half years.\n\nFrankly, these situations pale in comparison to the opportunity in front of you now.\n\nThe math is impossible to ignore.\n\nBetween their Death Valley and Andes Mountains discoveries, this $92 million miner could be sitting on $90 billion worth of 'White Gold'!\n\nThat means their market cap would have to grow 978X just to match their current reserves of OBL.","https://moneymorning.com/new-fuel-crystal-obl-will-replace-gasoline/","None"

"BREAKING: More Details About The Sad Death of Bill O’Reilly!\nThe Islip Coroner’s Office stated that last night, Bill O’Reilly was found dead at his home in Long Island. It seems that Bill decided to take his own life. This morning, LLOD reporter Skip Tetheluda was there when the family asked the media not to hold a press conference at this time, because they want to have privacy at this difficult and sad moment.\n\nTetheluda told us:\n\n“Bill O’Reilly did not want to spend the rest of his life, led by some false claims that he is some old douche who can’t keep his hands to himself. So, it seems that he does not want a life full of embarrassment, so he decided to blew the back of his head off with a 45 caliber handgun that was in his possession.\n\nThere was found a note at the crime scene. Even though the investigators did not want to reveal the message, we find out that O’Reilly wrote an apology to his daughter and wife and that he was sorry that they will always look him as a monster.”\n\nThere weren’t any comments from O’Reilly’s family. Investigators are still on the crime scene and they are looking for some evidence that could bring an answer to this mysterious death. This is a high-profile victim and the investigators do not want to reveal some details until they found some real evidence.

"Death row inmate eats an entire Bible as his last meal\nAtmore, Alabama | When the prison staff asked 33-year Jeremy Morris if he wanted anything special for his last meal, he answered: “I just want a Bible”.\n\nThe prison guards of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility thought he wanted to pray and repent, so they gave him an old copy of the King James Bible.\n\nAgainst all expectations, the condemned murderer began tearing up the holy book and eating it.\n\nIt took hours of chewing and swallowing small pieces of paper, but Mr. Morris ate the totality of the 1200-page book, including the cover.\n\nWalter Henri, the prison guard who handed him the old and worn out Bible, says the inmate seemed to “savor every bite”.\n\n“He kept tearing pieces from his Bible and eating them like they were potato chips!”\n\nHolman Prison director, Frank Davis, says the staff decided to let the prisoner eat the Bible because it didn’t violate the establishment’s “last meal policy”.\n\nIn most states and various countries where the death penalty is legal, it’s customary to give sentenced prisoners a special last meal at their request.\n\nRestrictions do apply, concerning mostly the legality, the accessibility and value of the meal.\n\nDespite its unusual nature, Mr. Morris’ choice of meal was “locally accessible and worth less than 40$”, making it conform to the rules of Alabama correctional facilities.\n\nJeremy Morris is expected to be executed tomorrow for the killing of two Catholic nuns in 2007.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/death-row-inmate-eats-an-entire-bible-as-his-last-meal/","1493165722.0"
"BREAKING: Michelle Wolf Fired — Comedy Central Apologizes To Sarah Sanders\nThe entertainment industry is reeling this morning after one of their rising stars, Michelle Wolf, has been fired from her show on Comedy Central. She was also dismissed as a contributing writer on The Daily Show. The move comes after Wolf’s brutal takedown of Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the White House Correspondent’s dinner:\n\n“I think she’s very resourceful, like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. Maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies.”\n\nWhat she obviously meant, if you listen to just about anyone, was that Sanders is a fat pig with lazy eye. Isn’t it obvious? Comedy Central thought so and dropped the hammer.

Michelle should have anticipated people’s reaction and softened the speech to suit the needs of the room.”\n\nYes, that seems perfectly reasonable.

"Trump's grad speech was like Elle's in Legally Blonde\nHaving a head of bleach blonde hair isn't the only thing President Trump has in common with Reese Witherspoon's character in Legally Blonde.\n\nThe two have a similar way with words as well.\n\nAs pointed out by Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show, Trump's commencement address at Liberty University this weekend drew parallels to the graduation speech that Elle Woods gives at the end of the hit 2001 film.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nJimmy Fallon has pointed out some similarities between Donald Trump's commencement address at Liberty University (left) and Elle Woods' speech at the end of Legally Blonde (right)\n\nThey're both Gemini vegetarians!

"White House Doctor Writes Note Saying Trump Too Sick to Talk to Mueller\nWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Amid reports that Donald Trump might soon be summoned to appear before Robert Mueller, the White House doctor wrote a note on Wednesday indicating that Trump was too sick to talk to the special counsel.\n\n“Donald Trump is not well,” Dr. Ronny Jackson wrote.\n\nThe doctor’s note offered a laundry list of ailments afflicting Trump, including flu-like symptoms, upset stomach, headaches, dizziness, confusion, and what Jackson called a “wartime foot injury that appears to be acting up.”\n\nJackson acknowledged in the note that his current assessment of Trump’s health was at odds with the robust picture he painted last week, but added, “Every patient is entitled to a second opinion, and this is mine.”\n\nMinutes after the White House doctor issued his note, the special counsel responded by indicating that if Trump is too ill to come to Mueller’s office, then Mueller would be “more than happy” to interrogate Trump at his sickbed.\n\nThe White House doctor, however, quickly rebuffed this offer. “The strain of being under oath and giving truthful answers could kill him,” the doctor said.","https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/white-house-doctor-writes-note-saying-trump-too-sick-to-talk-to-mueller/","None"
"BREAKING: American Judge Just Banned Sharia Law In All 50 States. Do You Support This ?\nBreitbart Texas asked what happens when there is a conflict between Sharia law and Texas law. [Dr. Taher] El-badawi said most of the time, the laws are in agreement. When pushed further he admitted that, “we follow Sharia law.” However, he explained, “If the parties are not satisfied with the tribunal’s decision, they do not have to accept it and they can take the matter to Texas civil courts.” He did not say what the social ramifications of rejecting the “judge’s” decision would be.\n\nEl-badawi restated several times that participation in the tribunal is voluntary. However, he would not discuss what happens to someone who did not follow their rulings.\n\nAn Islamic Tribunal that uses Sharia as the basis for law, not the US Constitution, the Bible nor the Texas State Constitution has been set up as a non-profit organization in Dallas. The tribunal claims that, for the most part, Sharia is in agreement with the laws of Texas.

"Secret Service Adds Emotional Protection Division To Safeguard Trump’s Psyche\nWASHINGTON—In an effort to respond to the vast and ever-changing dangers faced by the nation’s commander-in-chief, Secret Service administrators announced Wednesday the creation of an Emotional Protection Division to safeguard President Donald Trump’s psyche.\n\nThe new unit’s three dozen agents, who have undergone rigorous training to prepare for their challenging role, will be charged with defending the 45th president’s psychological well-being around the clock, investigating foreign and domestic threats to his self-esteem and quickly intercepting any spoken or written criticisms before they can harm his pride.\n\n“After conducting a full review of the operational procedures available to us, it became clear that adding this new division was the only way to meet President Trump’s emotional security needs,” said Secret Service director Joseph Clancy, noting that the president’s detail is specially trained in assessing risks and minimizing any opportunity for him to feel insecure or belittled. “His psyche could be put in grave danger from unfavorable poll numbers or suddenly come under attack from a White House press corps heavily armed with uncomfortable questions.”\n\n“All of our agents stand ready to lay down their lives to ensure nothing can hurt President Trump’s feelings.”\n\n“All of our agents stand ready to lay down their lives to ensure nothing can hurt President Trump’s feelings,” he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to officials, the Secret Service is reportedly conducting careful background checks on White House visitors to look for any red flags, such as A-list celebrities who might choose to decline a photo op with Trump. The department has also instituted measures to screen the president’s mail for messages that do not reinforce his belief in his own superiority, and to sweep any room before he enters to remove high-risk copies of The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\nHigh-ranking agency sources told reporters that their tireless efforts have already made the president’s psyche significantly more secure. In particular, they cited occasions in which agents have shielded Trump against credible attempts on his vanity, saying they have kept him away from photographs on the internet in which he appears in an unflattering light and from news reports indicating that some television programs have garnered higher ratings simply by mocking him.\n\n“We’ve already had one really close call,” said Clancy, citing an incident in which a member of the Secret Service jumped directly in front of Trump to prevent him from seeing primetime news coverage of massive rallies held to protest his administration. “But the moment we detected a risk, a few brave agents rushed in to surround the president and place their hands over his ears, safely ushering him into his motorcade before he could hear more than a few words of criticism.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The president was then immediately taken to a secure location where he was evaluated for any injury to his self-importance,” Clancy continued.\n\nWhile acknowledging the assignment’s significance, several agents bemoaned the difficulty of keeping a vigilant eye upon the constantly evolving risks to Trump’s feelings, observing that whenever the president travels, the Secret Service must vet his destination days or even weeks in advance to ensure it is free of anything that could pose any risk of offense.\n\n“It’s incredibly demanding work because his ego is such a big target,” said Roger Mercer, 36, an agent in the Emotional Protection Division. “There are new threats emerging every hour, and if even one of them gets through to him—really gets through to him—it’s all over.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can already tell the next four years are going to be the hardest of my career,” he added.","http://www.theonion.com/article/secret-service-adds-emotional-protection-division--55263/","None"
"NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is ‘Rigged’, Found Dead\nAn NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is “rigged.”\n\nDan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an “gangland-style execution”, hours after blowing the whistle on the “rigged Super Bowl” backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis.\n\nEarly reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend.\n\nGoodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football League’s Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sunday’s Super Bowl featuring the two teams.\n\nHowever Goodes went “off-script” in Minneapolis and was “physically removed” from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as “totally corrupt” and claiming the Super Bowl is “fixed.”\n\nTelling reporters that he is a “football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second”, Goodes said “Football in America in 2018 doesn’t need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn’t pass the sniff test.\n\n“I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can’t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won’t allow it.\n\n“Football in America won’t recover from this.”\n\nEarly reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an “gangland-style execution” in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.\n\nAccording to Goodes, the NFL have organized a “rigged game” that will earn “maximum revenue” for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.\n\n“This is the biggest scam in sports history,” Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. “The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.”\n\n“How do I know it’s scripted? I’ve read the damn thing.“\n\n“You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can’t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don’t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn’t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn’t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.”\n\n“The sad thing is that it’s legal. Can you believe that? It’s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.”\n\nExplaining that the NFL is officially registered as “entertainment,” Goodes said “The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.”\n\nThe NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as “entertainment” rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate “franchises” they would want you to believe.\n\nIn a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing “entertainment” in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.\n\nThe only other “sport” that occupies this legal position is the WWE.\n\nHow are games rigged?\n\nAccording to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.\n\n“Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn’t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they’re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed?\n\n“Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? I’m telling you now, they don’t care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes?”\n\n“The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes.”\n\n“How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games?”\n\n“Everyone is on the same side, that’s why.”\n\nFirst guy to congratulate Brady? Number 34. What a teammate! pic.twitter.com/azXq3qgN43 — OurState_CSU (@OurStateCSU) January 21, 2018\n\n“These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They can’t open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast.”\n\nWhy doesn’t anyone speak out?\n\nAccording to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear.\n\n“Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed.\n\n“It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl.”\n\n“And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. “We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. We’re exempt.”\n\nSuper Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.","http://yournewswire.com/nfl-lawyer-super-bowl-rigged-dead/","1517244399.0"
"Rep. Wilson Has Never Supported A Pro-Veteran Bill\nRep. Frederica Wilson has cast herself as the champion of veterans and their families with her recent attacks on President Donald Trump over comments he denies making to a Gold Star family.\n\nHowever, when it was time to cast a vote for veterans, the record shows that the Florida Democrat has not supported key legislation — or any legislation supporting veterans at all, for that matter.\n\nFor example, on Oct. 1, 2013, she opposed what was known as “H J Res 72 – Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014,” which VoteSmart.org said was “a motion to suspend rules and pass a joint resolution that appropriates funds for military and veterans’ benefits and payments for fiscal year 2014.”\n\nThe vote came at a time when a federal shutdown was a possibility. The resolution sought to ensure that veterans and their families would not be caught up in the partisan conflict on Capitol Hill.\n\nAs noted by Fox News, that same year she took another swipe at veterans.\n\nThe article said Wilson opposed “a bill that could have ensured that families of four soldiers slain in Afghanistan in 2013 received death and burial benefits.”\n\nIn July 2015, Wilson likewise had the opportunity to vote on the VA Accountability Act of 2015, a proposal which sought to authorize “the Department of Veterans Affairs to remove or demote a department employee based on performance or misconduct.”\n\nVoteSmart.org\n\nAs seen above, Wilson not only opposed the VA Accountability Act of 2015, but numerous other pieces of legislation that were designed to help veterans.\n\nIn fact, when it came time for other bills that would tighten up the ability of the VA to discipline staff in the name of better care for veterans, Wilson was there to vote no every time — except for once, when she didn’t vote at all.\n\nAnd many have caught on to the Democrat’s record, taking to Twitter to give their opinion.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidWaddell5/status/921154723062976512 ?\n\nDem Wilson no friend of veterans, vote record shows – Shame on her for politicizing the death of a vet. #Slimehttps://t.co/4APt48mrPE — Nina J Tomasieski (@NinaMorton) October 19, 2017\n\nRELATED: Reagan-Era Federal Judge Poised To Foil Mueller\n\nIn June, the Trump administration’s massive overhaul of the VA came before Congress as the “Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.”\n\nWilson rejected the wide-ranging plan to improve care for veterans and became one of only 55 members of Congress to oppose the bill.\n\nAt that time, she’d signed her name to a letter from several Democrats objecting to Trump’s military policy of not telegraphing troop movement to Congress or the media, a policy Trump said he follows to better protect the lives of men and women serving overseas.\n\nWhat do you think?

"Hollywood Actor Bruce Willis: ‘Trump Is The Best US President Ever, Anyone Who Dislikes Him Should Move To…’\nHollywood actor Bruce Willis once again expressed his unconditional support for President Donald Trump in a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon, although these days it’s very unusual for him to be supported by any Hollywood star.\n\nWhen Willis was asked about his opinion on Trump’s presidency so far he said: “I think that he’s doing great. In fact, he just might be the best US President ever.”\n\nFallon then asked him if he was serious about this statement because it would definitely sound like an exaggeration to many people. Willis responded:\n\n“Yeah I’m being serious about this. Trump has always been a winner and to be honest I can’t think of a better man to lead America at this moment.”\n\nBruce Willis is one the few conservatives in Hollywood who are not afraid to express their support for President Trump. He has always been a fan of Trump and everything that he represents – a successful businessman and a role model for every young American.\n\nWillis added: “Trump has a winning mentality and I believe that every American can identify with that. He is the guy that we need right now and I think that we should all settle our differences and support him.”\n\nHowever Willis is bothered by the attitude of many American politicians and stars who spend their time criticizing Trump. He said: “Before every election so far there were debates and fighting between candidates. But, once we had a winner everybody just stood behind the elected President. Now we see that the fighting and conflict continue long after the 2016 election. I don’t like that. It doesn’t look good.

They have put a team of investigators in place and are refusing to rule out a criminal homicide charge.\n\n[UPDATE: Chester Bennington’s Family & Friends Claim Media Guilty Of Murder Cover Up]\n\n“Murders are sometimes made to look like suicides. We think he was murdered, we just have to find out who was behind it,” said a police source.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s office confirmed the 41-year-old nu-metal icon was found dead, but refused to provide details, with the agency’s chief of operations, Brian Elias, remaining tight-lipped about whether media reports of suicide are accurate.\n\n“We are investigating all angles,” he said.\n\nShocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one. — Mike Shinoda (@mikeshinoda) July 20, 2017\n\nSUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES CONFIRMED\n\nBennington, who sang at Chris Cornell’s recent funeral after becoming close to the Soundgarden frontman in recent years, was reportedly working with Cornell’s foundation to prevent the sexual exploitation of vulnerable children.\n\nThe Linkin Park frontman, who was the father of six children, and was also the godfather to Chris Cornell’s son, was on record talking about the long-term emotional fallout of being sexually abused by an older male as a child.\n\n“If I think back to when I was really young, to when I was being molested, to when all these horrible things were going on around me, I shudder,” he told the metal magazine Kerrang! in 2011.\n\nNow investigators believe that the deaths of Cornell and Bennington – who died on Cornell’s birthday – may be linked.\n\nThe parallels between the two deaths are astonishing. The close friends, who were working on exposing notorious entertainment industry pedophiles, died in the same way – with Bennington’s death taking place on what would have been Cornell’s 53rd birthday.\n\nHISTORY REPEATS – SAME OLD DIRTY TRICKS\n\nClose friends of Cornell say that he was shown a “black book” that included the name of one of his professional associates. After setting up his foundation and investigating further, Cornell was close to exposing a network of pedophiles working within the entertainment industry – a dangerous job that he considered his “duty.”\n\nBut his friends believe he was taken out before he finished the job.\n\nI am in tears.Chester just told me how happy he was…..He was such a sweet and talented man……Ifeel so sad for his family,band mates and fans — Nikki Sixx (@NikkiSixx) July 20, 2017\n\nThe official investigation into Chris Cornell’s death is closed, but his widow and many of his fans are unsatisfied with the ruling by police and medical examiners that the Soundgarden frontman committed suicide.\n\nDetroit police wrapped up their investigations quickly and the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the death a suicide, but investigators are claiming that unexplained gaps in the official timeline of Cornell’s final moments and suspicious inconsistencies in the records suggest that Cornell’s death was not suicide at all, but a premeditated homicide and cover up.\n\nInvestigator Randy Cody is among those questioning the suicide ruling. He points to perceived timeline gaps, forensic questions and what he says are two signs that Cornell had a head wound that was not mentioned in autopsy reports.\n\nSpeaking to Detroit Free Press, he referenced Detroit police scanner audio in which a medic is heard saying: “patient did have an exercise rubber band around his neck, suggestions of possible strangulation, trauma to the back of the head, history of depression. Patient is cool to the touch in all areas at this time.”\n\nCody also questions whether medics really broke so many of Cornell’s ribs in efforts to resuscitate him.\n\n“You mean these medics did nine rib fractures (during CPR)? I’m not buying it,” said Cody, who also believes Cornell was killed because he was about to expose a child sex ring.\n\nChester had 6 kids. If anyone out there thinks the world is better without you. You are so unspeakably wrong on every level. Get help plz — OneRepublic (@OneRepublic) July 20, 2017\n\nUNANSWERED QUESTIONS\n\nIn May, Chester Bennington tweeted, “As of today, my life’s purpose is one of love and understanding. The world needs to change and that change comes from within. Hate, pride, vengeance and fear are the plague of the earth. Love, kindness, compassion, empathy and service to others are the cure.”\n\nHe added a challenge to his followers on Twitter, “Let’s all choose to be a part of the cure. If we look outside ourselves to find love and peace we will ultimately fail. It has to come from within. Lead by example.”\n\nChester Bennington was a mature, well-adjusted man who had exorcised his demons and had dedicated the rest of his life to fighting for others – including his six children and his godson, Christopher Cornell – and exposing the pedophile ring in entertainment industry.\n\nHowever evil forces seem determined to shut these kind of people down. As details of his death emerge, it is worth keeping an eye on who pushes hardest with the suicide angle and attempts to shut down anyone who raises questions. They may be involved in the cover-up.","http://yournewswire.com/chester-bennington-murdered/","1500651559.0"

"Harvey Weinstein Gives Names of Hollywood & Washington DC Pedophiles to FBI\nHarvey Weinstein Gives Names of Hollywood & Washington DC Pedophiles to FBI\n\nDisgraced movie mogul cuts deal by naming elite pedophilia network to law enforcement\n\nNow, it seems, he is using all the information, on the depraved crimes that take place in the upper reaches of society, that he has gathered over the years to his advantage, as his 'get out of jail free card'.\n\nWeinstein has been part of America's oligarchy for decades and has used his power, wealth, and political reach to bully and rape those in weaker positions than himself for far too long.\n\nHaving been completely blacklisted by the entertainment industry, and even his close friends in politics, such as Bill and Hillary Clinton , rapist Weinstein clearly feels he has run out of options.\n\nAccording to sources within the FBI, Weinstein has offered up the names of some of the most powerful and influential people in the United States in connection with pedophilia, child pornography, and human trafficking.\n\nAt this point, it's not clear what sort of deal will be made in return for the information, if a deal will be made at all.\n\nPerhaps this could be the 'Hurricane Harvey' that Donald Trump was referring to when he made his recent comments about 'the calm before the storm'.\n\nIt has now become crystal clear that Weinstein has just been the tip of the iceberg, and according to the New York Times, the floodgates have well and truly been opened in Hollywood.\n\nNY Times reports: In recent days, the singer Bjork, the “Riverdale” actress Lili Reinhart and the “Inside Edition” correspondent Lisa Guerrero lodged new accusations against other men who work in entertainment.\n\nThe singer and actress Courtney Love accused the powerful Creative Artists Agency of punishing her after she raised questions about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior in 2005, and a recently unearthed video clip of Ms. Love making the charge has gone viral.\n\nThe model Cameron Russell started a thread on her Instagram account on misconduct by men in fashion. It has led to more than 50 models anonymously sharing their stories of harassment.\n\nAt issue now is whether or not Hollywood can continue its old way of doing business, with self-styled “outlaw” executives and auteurs getting away with sexual misconduct as lawyers and publicists protect them.\n\n“I think it’s upsetting and devastating, all of the stories that have come out,” said Nina Jacobson, a film producer who was formerly the president of the Walt Disney Company’s Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group.\n\n“But I think the floodgates being opened is something that had to happen and that finally brings a subject to the surface that has sort of gone unchecked for countless years.”\n\nBeginning with an article about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein that The New York Times published on Oct. 5, more than 30 accusers have stepped forward with charges of harassment, assault and even rape against the mogul.\n\nThe police in New York and London have started criminal investigations. (Mr. Weinstein has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex.)\n\nThe industry took a step toward that on Monday when the Producers Guild of America moved to terminate Mr. Weinstein’s membership and issued a statement that seemed to catch up with the wave of disapproval sweeping social media.\n\n“Sexual harassment of any type is completely unacceptable,” it said in part.\n\n“This is a systemic and pervasive problem requiring immediate industrywide action.”\n\nOn Saturday, the board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stripped Mr. Weinstein of his academy membership.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.nnettle.com/news/2953-harvey-weinstein-gives-names-of-hollywood-washington-dc-pedophiles-to-fbi/","None"
"BREAKING: US Pilot Shot Down After Destroying Korean Missile\nUS Air Force Captain Bob Marchand is alive but missing in action after his F-22 Raptor was shot down in what may be North Korean waters. Captain Marchand, whose call-sign is “Fricken Choad,” sent word to his wife from a fishing vessel off the coast of Pyongyang.\n\nCaptain Marchand had no choice but to contact his wife after the United States military officially declined to acknowledge his existence. In a statement about “an incident” near North Korea, the Pentagon released this statement:\n\n“There was an incident this morning inside of North Korean airspace that the United States government has no part of. The North Korean government and the United Nations will be running their own independsent investigations”\n\nAccording to Mrs. Marchand, that’s not at all true. She said she understands why the Air Force has to deny his presence there, but the fact that she can confirm that he’s alive should change the rules:\n\n“Bob called me from a satellite phone in the middle of the ocean. Why can’t they send a helicopter? They have bases in South Korea and Japan.”\n\nShe says her husband needs to be picked up not only because he is an American but because he is also a hero who just saved millions of lives:\n\n“Bob told me to remind them what he did. Remind them that North Korea just launched a live nuke at Japan. Tell them I shot it out of the sky. Bob just wants to come home.”\n\nThe Air Force, Pentagon, White House and Asian Air Command all deny that any such operation happened. General Marjorie Bujnowski at NORAD says that Marchand is on a codeword-clearance mission and as far as she knows, is alive and well and 6000 miles from Korea.\n\nWe’ll follow this story as it develops.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.online/2018/01/20/breaking-us-pilot-shot-down-after-destroying-korean-missile/","1516424400.0"
"Official Calls for UN Peacekeepers to Be Deployed on Streets of Chicago\n(ANTIMEDIA) — As 2017 comes to a close, the city of Chicago has racked up over 3,400 shootings and over 650 homicides this year, and Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin is seeking to implement a highly controversial policy to deal with the problem.\n\nOn Thursday, Boykin shared his plans to reach out to the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Support, Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, to seek help with “horrific levels of shootings” in the city of Chicago. If the organization were to step in, it would mark the first time a U.N. peacekeeping mission was implemented on American soil.\n\nWhile on his way to New York to meet with Fernandez-Taranco, Boykin said:\n\n“I’m hoping to appeal to the U.N. to actually come to Chicago and meet with victims of violence, and maybe even possibly help out in terms of peacekeeping efforts, because I think it’s so critical for us to make sure that these neighborhoods are safe.”\n\nBoykin went on to say that Chicago’s leaders have failed to protect these neighborhoods from themselves.\n\n“There is a quiet genocide taking place in too many of our communities. Eighty percent of those who are being killed by gun violence are African American, and often killed at the hands of another African American. So we must protect these population groups, and that’s what the United Nations does. They’re a peacekeeping force. They know all about keeping the peace, and so we’re hopeful that they’ll hear our appeal.”\n\nBoykin then elaborated on what he hopes the U.N. might accomplish in the city:\n\n“They’ve been able to help in places like Africa and abroad, where they’ve sent troops in and sent forces in to help protect minority and vulnerable populations, and so quite frankly I think the same can be said for here in Chicago. I’m talking about physical security. I’m also talking about maybe suggestions for what we can do in Chicago to help protect our minority populations. We’re being, again, decimated by the violence that we see here in Chicago. I mean this is really a genocide, and we have to do something to stop it.”\n\nIt is unclear whether Boykin understands the actual definition of genocide.\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel did not respond directly to Boykin’s plans but did highlight recent, though small, improvements in crime statistics while adding he has plans to guarantee “people feel a sense of security.”\n\nChicago is no stranger to such overbearing suggestions. In January, Donald Trump posted a tweet that has been liked 205,000 times. The president of the United States threatened to “send in the Feds” in response to the gun violence in Chicago.\n\nIf Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017\n\nThe tweet had talking heads discussing the possibility of sending in the National Guard in to deal with the city’s violence. Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner quickly responded by saying that such an extreme decision “would be a mistake.”\n\nNevertheless, the main solution the city appears to endorse merely adds more police power to a region already inundated with a heavy police presence known for violating residents’ rights. In September, Chicago’s Community Development Commission approved a 30.4-acre land acquisition, a step in the process of building an enormous multi-million dollar police training center on the city’s West Side, a move that local residents have found “bizarre” and misdirected.\n\nDespite the surging violence on the streets of Chicago and the staggering segregation that disenfranchises too many Chicagoans, the fact remains that U.N. Peacekeepers are typically deployed to war zones where they deal with terrorist groups, rebel fighters, and ethnic militias, none of which are present in Chicago.\n\nCreative Commons / Anti-Media / Report a typo","http://theantimedia.org/un-peacekeepers-chicago/","1513341394.0"
"Palestinians recognize Texas as part of Mexico\nJERUSALEM – In response to US President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, the Palestinian National Authority has announced that it will recognize Texas as a state of Mexico since it was violently annexed by the United States in the 1840s.\n\n“The territory north and east of the Rio Grande is very important to the Mexican people,” explained a PNA spokesperson. “Before American settlers showed up and implemented slavery, Mexico oversaw this land. Then, President Polk sent his armies to invade the rest of these Mexican territories, and force the country to give up California, New Mexico, most of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado. We may soon recognize these states as part of Mexico too.”\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says that this is a new approach to Mexican-US relations, and hopes it will help ease the tension between the two countries over security and immigration.\n\n“We understand that the Mexican state of Texas is a sacred place for many large-buckled Americans, but they can rest assured that a two-state solution or a wall was not feasible,” explained Abbas.\n\n“Besides, most people in Texas speak Spanish.”\n\nThe Palestinian consulate in Mexico City will soon be moved to Houston to formally recognize the seized territory as part of Mexico.\n\nAt press time, President Trump hopes that his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital will offer a new path for Middle East violence.","https://www.thebeaverton.com/2017/12/palestinians-recognize-texas-part-mexico/","1512585161.0"
"Chris Collins Says John Lewis Is “Like A Spoiled Chimp That Got Too Many Bananas And Rights”\nRep. Chris Collins (R-NY), a member of the Trump transition team, on Monday accused Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) of acting like a “spoiled child” after the civil rights icon suggested that Russia’s interference in the U.S. election undermined the legitimacy of Donald Trump’s presidency. During a Martin Luther King Jr. Day discussion on Fox Business, network contributor Dagen McDowell took issue with Trump’s Twitter tirade, which accused Lewis of not taking enough action to help his constituents. “My opinion is, what John Lewis is doing, he’s pouting,” Collins opined. “He lost. It’s like a spoiled child and we’ve seen it with the others. They can’t get over the fact that they lost. And what do spoiled little kids do? You know they run around and throw a tantrum.”\n\n“So, what are you saying? You’re actually implying that what Lewis is doing is displaying infantile behavior? Is that where you’re going with this?” McDowell asked Collins. “Look, you can take it any way you want, it doesn’t make a difference,” he replied. “At the end of the day, we’re talking here about a man who’s supposedly responsible for organizing a civil rights revolution or something more than half a century ago, and you would have Americans of all races and ethnicities believe that such a man – someone who’s allegedly responsible for such great things – is today incapable of accepting defeat in a political sense. The two just don’t go together, it’s like trying to mix oil with milk – it just won’t happen.”\n\nCollins continued, “Bottom line, for better or worse, John Lewis is a man who’s had a mediocre career in politics thanks to his alleged heroism in the 1960s. Well, let me tell you one thing – there have been a lot of people over the course of this country’s history that have suffered worse things than beatings by police officers. We’ve had people who were tortured, mutilated, shot, slaughtered, decapitated – you name it and someone in this country has probably suffered it. And yet none of them are mentioned today, and none of them have had political careers built on the foundation of their alleged suffering. And that’s exactly my point – John Lewis is a man who’s been granted too many rights by white people out of fear of retribution. He didn’t become a politician because he could contribute something; he was granted that status to shut him up.”\n\n“And now, when things are finally coming out into the open, he’s having a hard time accepting that his entire so-called career is a failure and that he and those like him lost to a superior politician,” he continued. “To make matters worse – they lost to Donald Trump, who’s not even a career politician to begin with. Ultimately, he can be as upset as he wants, but he’s acting like nothing more than a child – no, scratch that – than a chimp that’s lost one of his bananas and is now throwing a tantrum because of it. But, it’s not his fault, let’s clarify that; the problem is that chimps belong in a zoo and not the House of Representatives. At the end of the day, he shouldn’t be upset – I guess Donald Trump is just too good at snatching bananas off of unsuspecting chimps,” Collins concluded.","http://politicops.com/chris-collins-says-john-lewis-like-spoiled-chimp-got-many-bananas-rights/","1484589800.0"

"Dr. Gallo: “I Invented AIDS To Depopulate Humanity”\nDr. Gallo: “I Invented AIDS To Depopulate Humanity”:\n\nDr. Robert Gallo, the scientist credited with ‘discovering’ the HIV virus in 1984, has admitted that he created AIDS in order to reduce the world’s population.\n\nIn 1984, Gallo filed a U.S. patent application for his invention of the HIV/AIDS virus.\n\nDailypost.co.za reports:\n\nNormally, when a patent is filed and approved, as Dr. Gallo’s was, anyone who uses the product or invention owes a royalty payment to the artificer.\n\nThus, holding the intellectual property laws to their fullest interpretations, one must solely marvel why Dr. Gallo has yet to file a proceedings seeking to recover damages from the usage of his invention? As odd as this state of affairs could sound, it bears need for extra scrutiny.\n\nThe scientific evidence is complete and compelling, the AIDS Virus is a designer bi-product of the U.S. Special Virus program. The Special Virus program was a federal virus development program that persisted in the U.S from 1962 until 1978…..\n\nThe U.S. Special Virus was then added as ‘compliment’ to vaccinum inoculations in Africa and Manhattan. Shortly thereafter the world was engulfed with mass infections of somebody’s animal virus that differed from any illustrious human sickness, it was highly contagious and additional significantly,\n\nA review of the Special Virus Flow Chart (“research logic”) reveals the United States was seeking a ‘virus particle’ that might negatively impact the defense mechanisms of the system. The program sought to modify the ordination of the virus particle during which to splice in associate degree animal “wasting disease” referred to as “Visna”.\n\nAccording to the Proceedings of the us of America, AIDS is an biological process, laboratory development of the peculiar Visna Virus, first detected in Icelandic sheep. Recently, American and world scientists ensure with 100 percent certainty the laboratory genesis of AIDS.\n\nThis fact is more underscored once one reviews the ‘multiply-spliced’ nature of the HIV ‘tat’ sequence and Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper, “Reverse Transcriptase of Type-C virus Particles of Human Origin”.Dr. Gallo’s 1971 Special Virus paper is identical to his 1984 announcement of AIDS. Upon further review the record reveals that he filed his patent on AIDS, before he made the announcement with Secretary troubler. Earlier this year, Dr. Gallo conceded his role as a ‘Project Officer’ for the federal virus development program, the Special Virus.\n\nThe Flow Chart of the program and the 15 progress reports are undeniable proof of the United States’ game to cull world populations via the unleashing of a stealing biological organism that may ‘waste’ humanity.\n\nIn light of this true genesis of the world’s most divesting biological scourge, it is the u. s. that owes ‘royal’ payments to the innocent victims. Each associated each victim of AIDS is worthy of a proper apology and a way of economic closure for an invention of death and despair, perpetrated by the United States.\n\nThe eyes of the world are upon the overall Accounting Office’s Health Care Team, under the direction of William J. Scanlon. Between 1964 and 1978, the secret federal virus program spent $550 million dollars of payer cash to create AIDS. It is now necessary to pay no matter it takes to dismantle associate invention that has junction rectifier to the best crime against humanity within the history of the globe.\n\nSource : YourNewsWire","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.antinews.in/dr-gallo-i-invented-aids-depopulate-humanity/","1494771912.0"
"Bombshell: Dems/Teamsters Order Puerto Rican Stand-Down To Embarrass Trump\nDemocrats and Puerto Rican teamsters have orchestrated a stand-down of essential supply distribution throughout Puerto Rico in an effort to make President Trump appear ineffective at responding to the humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe Puerto Rico teamsters Union called “Frente Amplio,” a group of private contractors working for the federal government, are refusing to distribute key supplies throughout Puerto Rico because they’re seeking revenge over policies they view as hurtful to their industry set by the Puerto Rican governor.\n\nBut Democrats in the U.S. are keen to blame Trump for the distribution debacle, saying he’s not doing enough to help the people there.\n\nHis daily twitter meltdowns confirm it.

Michael Valle, commander of the federal relief effort in Puerto Rico. “As a Puerto Rican, I can tell you that the problem has nothing to do with the U.S. military, FEMA, or the DoD.”\n\n“The aid is getting to Puerto Rico. The problem is distribution. The federal government has sent us a lot of help; moving those supplies, in particular, fuel, is the issue right now.”\n\nValle says they have the water, food, generators, medicine, and fuel, but they’re not being moved across the country as quickly as needed, and there’s ships full of supplies that still need to unload at the ports which remain full.\n\n“It’s the lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers,” Valle said. “Supplies we have. Trucks we have.”\n\n“However, only 20% of the drivers show up to work.”\n\n“As a Puerto Rican, what happens here for the people is personal to me,” Valle said. “To say that we are not provided all of the help and resources needed is just not true.

"CBS Discovers: David Hogg Lied, He Was At Home During MSD High School Shooting!\nAccording to the latest CBS documentary , David Hogg, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student, who became the leading face in the protests organized over increased gun control, wasn’t in his school in the time when the shooting took place.\n\nDavid Hogg threw the bombshell himself who made the admission to a CBS News interviewer as part of the documentary “39 Days.” The program chronicles the birth of the student-led “Never Again” movement that culminated in the “March for our Lives” in Washington D.C. on Saturday.\n\n“39 Days” has not yet aired, but an excerpt posted online by CBS News (and included below) includes interviews with the students leading the gun control movement, including Hogg, Delaney Tarr, Cameron Kasky, and Emma Gonzalez. Hogg, who describes himself as a “student journalist,” admits he was at home at the time of the shooting, but rode his bike to school to “get as many interviews as I could.”\n\nThis is completely opposite from his statements given in Time Magazine where he claimed that when the shooting took place, he was in his classroom.\n\nThere is no evidence why Hogg wasn’t at school when the terrific shooting took place. He has also admitted that he didn’t know most of the students who have been killed in the shooting.\n\nDAVID HOGG: I didn’t know most of these people at a very personal level, but I wanted to make their voices heard and that’s what I’m really trying to do.\n\nHis latest claim that he was at home at the time of the shooting contradicts everything that he has said before.\n\nWhen Hogg heard a “pop” while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a “Code Red” exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned.\n\nAnd then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor—Hogg doesn’t know his name but calls him an angel—knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg—who’s an editor at the school’s TV station—found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing.\n\nThe shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day.\n\n“While I was in there, I thought, ‘What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?’” Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. “And the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that’s all I could think: Get other people’s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that’s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.”\n\nCBS, the TV for which Hogg gave the statements , didn’t challenge him so he didn’t explain the contradiction.\n\nHogg’s statement can be seen just past the 4:30 mark of the video clip below.\n\nThanks for reading ☺\n\nFeatured Images Source H/T: silence is consent","http://theconservativetime.com/cbs-discovers-david-hogg-lied-he-was-at-home-during-msd-high-school-shooting/","1522251299.0"
"Judge Cuts Pedophile’s Prison Term Claiming 3-Yr-Old ‘Asked’ To Be Raped\nA California judge has caused outrage after slashing 15 years off the prison sentence of a pedophile convicted of raping a 3-year-old child.\n\nOrange County Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly cut the child rapist’s prison term down to ten years from 25 years claiming that “he didn’t mean to harm” the 3-year-old girl that he raped.\n\nHe also backed the claim from child rapist Kevin Rojano that the young girl initiated the act of sodomy. Rojano said in his own defense that “she asked me to do it.“\n\nRojano was convicted on December 3 of sodomizing a child younger than 10 and lascivious acts with a minor. The pedophile was originally sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n\nHowever Judge Kelly then trimmed a massive 15 years off Rojano’s sentence, saying it would be “cruel and unusual punishment” to impose the maximum prison term because the 20-year-old lacked “callous disregard for (the victim’s) well-being.”\n\nProsecutors said Rojano was playing video games June 4 in the garage of his Santa Ana home when a 3-year-old relative wandered in, and investigators said the man became sexually aroused by the child and assaulted her.\n\nThe girl’s mother was unable to get into the locked garage as she looked for the child, and prosecutors said Rojano covered the toddler’s mouth to keep her from yelling.\n\nRojano let the girl out of the garage, and her mother was unaware of the abuse until her daughter complained of pain.\n\n“In looking at the facts of Mr. Rojano’s case, the manner in which this offense was committed is not typical of a predatory, violent brutal sodomy of a child case,” the judge claimed in his decision.\n\n“Mr. Rojano did not seek out or stalk (the victim).\n\n“He was playing video games and she wandered into the garage.\n\n“He inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm (the victim) when he sexually assaulted her.”\n\nKelly also said that Rojano, who had been abused as a child, deserved clemency because he said he regretted sodomizing the three-year-old girl.\n\n“Although serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child,” the judge claimed.\n\n“There was no violence or callous disregard for (the victim’s) well-being.”\n\nProsecutors said they strongly disagreed with the judge’s “outrageous” decision to reduce Mr. Rojano’s prison sentence and plan to appeal the sentence.","http://yournewswire.com/judge-pedophile-prison-raped/","1518281010.0"
"Are Sandy Hook child victims alive and well?\nIt is five years since the Dec. 14, 2012 shooting massacre of 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nWolfgang Halbig is a former Florida state trooper, school safety consultant, and a Sandy Hook “truther” whom Lenny Pozner sued but then dropped the lawsuit.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Dec. 31, 2017, Fellowship of the Minds received an email from Mr. Halbig, with the startling claim that the 20 Sandy Hook child victims are alive and well. His words:\n\nTRULY THANK FACEBOOK IN HELPING ME FIND THE SANDY HOOK CHILDREN THAT ARE STILL ALIVE AS YOU CAN SEE\n\nTo support that claim, Halbig included this composite image (see below) of the 20 victims as 6-year-olds and as they presumably are today.\n\n↓Click image to enlarge↓\n\nThree things about the above image:\n\nThe young adult pictures of the 12 females resemble their childhood pictures, especially the seven who posed as adults together: Avielle Richman, Grace McDonnell, Olivia Engel, Madeleine Hsu, Charlotte Bacon, Caroline Previdi, and Allison Wyatt.\n\nThe young adult pictures of the 8 males don’t much resemble the child pictures.\n\nIf the adult pics indeed are of the child victims, that means they were not 6 years old on Dec. 14, 2012, but were much older.\n\nReferring to another group photo of eight Sandy Hook female child “victims” (see pic below), Professor James Fetzer said:\n\n“I think the photo of eight girls is right. Wolf[gang] talked about it on [John B. Wells’ internet radio show] Caravan to Midnight and said that he had had it vetted by an expert who works w/ FBI.”\n\nI asked Halbig in an email for the source(s) of the pics of the child-victims-as-adults, but got no response.\n\nSince Halbig said in his email to FOTM that Facebook had helped him find the child “victims” as adults, I conducted a search for each of their names on Facebook. This is what I found:\n\nIn most cases, the Facebook pages of individuals with the same names as the Sandy Hook victims are set to private and thus, no information can be gleaned, not even a picture. As an example,there is only one Avielle Richman and only one Jessica Rekos on Facebook, but their respective pages are both set to private.\n\nand only one on Facebook, but their respective pages are both set to private. In some cases, e.g., Josephine Gay and Catherine Hubbard, there is no one by that name on Facebook.\n\nI was able to find the Facebook pages of four individuals whose adult images resemble the Sandy Hook child victims . They are:\n\n(1) Olivia Engel: The only Olivia Engel on Facebook says she is the owner of Olivia Engel Jewelry Designs (she makes necklaces) and lives in West Hartford, CT. Here’s a screenshot of her Facebook page, in the event she deletes the account or takes it to private.\n\nBelow is the composite I made of Sandy Hook Olivia Engel (#1), Halbig’s Olivia Engel (#2), and Facebook Olivia Engel (#3). Note the striking resemblance: same eyebrows, same nose, same labial folds around her mouth when she smiles, same chin.\n\n(2) Allison Wyatt: I found an Allison Wyatt whose adult image (#3) resembles the Sandy Hook Allison Wyatt (#1) and Halbig’s Allison Wyatt (#2) — same eyebrows, same face shape, same blonde hair color. However, one must be “befriend” Facebook Allison Wyatt for information on biographical details.\n\n(3) Emilie Parker: Out of several Emilie Parkers on Facebook, there is one “Emily Parker” (#3) who most resembles Sandy Hook Emilie Parker (#1) and Halbig’s Emilie Parker (#2) — same blonde hair, same nose, same fondness for the color pink. There is no biographical information other than “Community Organization”.\n\n(4) Jesse Lewis: Out of the Jesse Lewises on Facebook, this Jesse Lewis (#3) — who is a HVAC Tech (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Technician) at Tri State Enterprise (a contractor in Flatwoods, Kentucky) and lives in Argillite, Kentucky — most resembles the Halbig Jesse Lewis (#2).\n\nOf the above four (Olivia Engel, Allison Wyatt, Emilie/Emily Parker, Jesse Lewis), the strongest resemblance is among the child, adolescent and young adult versions of Olivia Engel.\n\nTo make the case that the Sandy Hook child victims are still alive, all that is needed is just one case. If, say, Olivia Engel is alive and well and living in Hartford, Connecticut, then it means we were lied to. We then have every reason to believe the other 19 child victims also did not die at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.\n\nLastly, here’s something rather bizarre.\n\nI found the Facebook page of the Nancy Lanza: https://www.facebook.com/nancy.lanza.79.\n\nThere is very little on Nancy Lanza’s Facebook. Her last post (see below) was an update of her profile picture on March 5, 2013 — 2 months 19 days after she had been shot to death by her son, Adam.\n\nSee also “Are these the dead Sandy Hook kids all grown up alive and well” on Before It’s News, and:\n\n~Eowyn","https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2018/01/02/are-sandy-hook-child-victims-alive-and-well/","1514869200.0"

"BREAKING: Intel Officer Reveals Obama Could Be ‘First President In History’ To Be Hit With a FELONY INDICTMENT\n24 Shares Share Tweet Share Email\n\nAfter months of the liberal media ridiculing Trump over his claim that Obama spied on him during the election, Trump finally got vindication this week. America learned the truth on Tuesday that Obama did in fact unconstitutionally spy on Trump throughout the presidential election, leaving Barack Obama with his pants down yet again.\n\nNow former intelligence officer Lt. Col Tony Shaffer just revealed that Obama’s wiretapping was not only a federal crime, but says that the results of this investigation will likely result in Obama being brought up on FELONY CHARGES. The colonel’s dire prediction about Obama’s future is sending shock-waves through the black hearts of liberals all across America today, as it’s now thrown a monkey wrench into Obama’s plans to stage his “political comeback” this fall.\n\nIn a a recent interview with Trending Today USA, Lt. Col Tony Shaffer called ‘Obamagate’ an “order of magnitude” even bigger than the Watergate scandal because the incident included “using nation-state resources for purposes of political gain.”\n\nWhen asked if Obama could be arrested for violating the law, he said that it would be the “first time a former president could be indicted for a felony.”\n\n“…I think it is very possible that he acted outside of the scope of his duties, responsibilities and authorities to turn the resources of a nation-state on a candidate. This is, as I’ve said before, soviet-dictator level wrongdoing,” he added.\n\nShaffer said that Obama using government resources to spy on Trump was for the sole purpose of getting Hillary into office, as Obama hoped the wiretapping would produce enough “dirt” on Trump to sabotage his presidential run.\n\nGiven Shaffer’s lengthy military career, his rise to the top of the American intelligence community, and his current senior position at the prestigious London Center for Policy Research, his prediction about Obama shouldn’t be scoffed at. Being brought up on felony charges would completely destroy Obama’s plan of making his political comeback this year, as he’d be trying to figure out a way to keep himself out of prison instead of spending his hours obsessing with ways to bring Trump down.\n\nThe Hill reported on just how extensive Obama’s spying truly was, as this unconstitutional move wasn’t just limited to listening in on Trump’s calls. They reported:\n\nIf these reports are accurate, it means U.S. intelligence agencies secretly surveilled at least a half dozen Trump associates. And those are just the ones we know about.\n\nBesides Manafort, the officials include former Trump advisers Carter Page and Michael Flynn. Last week, we discovered multiple Trump “transition officials” were “incidentally” captured during government surveillance of a foreign official. We know this because former Obama adviser Susan Rice reportedly admitted “unmasking,” or asking to know the identities of, the officials. Spying on U.S. citizens is considered so sensitive, their names are supposed to be hidden or “masked,” even inside the government, to protect their privacy.\n\nIn May, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates acknowledged they, too, reviewed communications of political figures, secretly collected under President Obama.\n\nAfter getting away with whatever the hell he wanted over the past 8 years and wiping his butt with the Constitution, it looks like Obama’s cockiness might just be his undoing. He might have gotten away with his antics in the past, but things are vastly different now that Obama doesn’t have all his minions blocking all investigations into his crimes, as was the case when he was president.\n\nIf this colonel’s predication is in fact true, Obama’s little plan to keep trolling Trump with his little shadow government from the headquarters of his D.C. home could soon be coming to an abrupt end. How poetic would it be that after spending 8 years pandering to terrorists and trying to destroy America that Obama could live out the rest of his life behind bars in an orange jumpsuit? Sounds like perfect justice for America!\n\nSHARE this story if you want to see Obama behind bars for the rest of his treasonous life!","https://theglobalheadlines.net/breaking-intel-officer-reveals-obama-could-be-first-president-in-history-to-be-hit-with-a-felony-indictment-2/","1517511367.0"
"Wikileaks releases ‘Deep State Files’ #DeepStateFiles\nINTERNET — Early Christmas morning, Julian Assange announced the release of 700 Terabytes in what’s being called the ‘Deep State Files’.

"Eric Trump: “My Father’s Tax Return Is Irrelevant Because We’re Going To Cancel Taxes For 'Extra Productive People' Anyway”\nPresident Donald Trump was very active on Twitter Easter morning and lashed back at protesters wanting to see his tax returns, saying he shouldn’t have to show them since he “easily won the Electoral College.” Moments after he defended no longer calling China a currency manipulator, now that they are giving him a helping hand with North Korea, Trump dismissed calls for his tax returns by responding on Twitter. “I did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?” Trump tweeted.\n\nAs always, his son Eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. During an brief phone interview with KYXL Radio based out of Orlando, Florida, President Trump’s second son argued that his father’s tax return is “irrelevant,” largely because “he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.” He said, “When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.”\n\nEric continued, “And while we’re on the subject, I kind of have to say, it’s funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. That’s kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, I’m not saying something that’s revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that he’s president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. That’s a catastrophe.”\n\nThe self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to “fix” the broken tax system of the United States. “At the end of the day, it’s irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not. It won’t matter soon anyway,” Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that “cancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy.” “It’s our way of saying ‘good job’ to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. It is to them that this country owes its gratitude. They are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.”\n\n“As for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, I can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. This is not a move designed to make it so my father doesn’t have to pay tax; like I said, it’s a sort of ‘thank you’ from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working Americans who have done their duties thus far. As for the rest, I guess they’ll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. No more freeloaders, that’s where we’re going with this. Bottom line, if you’ve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. And you’re going to have to pretty soon,” Eric concluded.","http://politicalo.com/eric-trump-fathers-tax-return-irrelevant-going-cancel-taxes-extra-productive-people-anyway/","1492364872.0"

"BREAKING: Media mogul Harvey Weinstein commits suicide in Arizona\nSCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA – Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein shot and killed himself, officials said — just months after spending time in Arizona for addiction treatment.\n\nThe film mogul, shot himself at a Scottsdale hotel in Arizona and the weapon reportedly was found at the scene. He was 65. His body was discovered inside the hotel room and officials in Arizona are now waiting for toxicology test results to determine the exact cause of death.\n\nEarlier this week, Harvey Weinstein took to Facebook to post about the accusations leveled against him, claiming they were “false” and “only GOD knows the truth.”\n\nAccording to the report, Weinstein, who had been accused of sexual assault by more than 80 women since October is alleged to have earlier sent a private message via facebook to a close pal few minutes before his suicide. The content read: “The accusations are sicknesses that will take my life, I cannot handle them any longer. THEY Have Won This Life. BUT HEAVEN IS MY HOME.”\n\nThe message also read, “I LOVE GOD and I LOVE MY CHILDREN, My Love Forever ! My BROTHER Bob Weinstein and the entire family and many more to come each of you or a total gift from GOD stay strong.”\n\n​​Police Chief of the Phoenix Police Department Jeri Williams said everyone at the unit is “deeply sad.”\n\n“Our aim, as always, is to investigate this issue and provide the public with fact-based, unbiased results and hold anyone accountable for the cause. No stone will be left unturned to unravel the mystery behind this death ” Jeri said.\n\n“Just terrible news from Arizona this evening on the passing of my brother, the media mogul Harvey Weinstein. I cannot imagine his pain or the heartbreak our family is dealing with this evening. Our family pray for his loved ones,” R.I.P, my hero!, his brother Bob Weinstein tweeted.\n\nThe exact reason that may have caused Weinstein to commit suicide is not yet known, nor is when the police will release their official report to establish the cause of death.\n\nWeinstein had been spending time, and money, undergoing treatment at Gentle Path at the Meadows, a pricey sexual addiction rehabilitation facility located in Wickenburg, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nHe was also racking up costs at multiple fancy restaurants and receiving hypnotherapy, while staying at exclusive locations.\n\nThe tab for his way of life was adding up, while legal expenses loomed, from both his ex wife’s worry over child support, his pending divorce from his current wife, and the possibility of legal action from his accusers.\n\nWeinstein’s legal costs related to his many accusers could have ranged anywhere from $500,000 to more than $1 million each month, Pasadena attorney D. Jason Lyon, with Hahn & Hahn, estimated.\n\nHis first wife, Eve Chilton, felt less settled, as she filed court documents in New York in January that there was ‘real and present danger’ that defendant [Weinstein] would default on his financial obligations, meaning his hefty child support bill for the children from their marriage, which ended in 2004.\n\nChilton had asked for $5 million as security for the payments that would come due over the next year, but her request was been denied.\n\n[geoads1]","https://web.archive.org/web/http://abcnewgo.com/breaking-media-mogul-harvey-weinstein-commits-suicide-in-arizona/","1451627993.0"
"Obama Appeal Denied: Judge Orders Him To Pay Back $400 Million\nBarack Obama’s appeal to the Supreme Court has been denied, meaning the lower court ruling that he pays restitution will stand. That order, from Judge Sanford Batt of the West Texas Federal Probate Court, states that Obama and his family will forfeit their assets and future earnings as well as gifts and presidential pensions until the $400 million he handed to Iranian hardliners is paid back:\n\n“That money was given to terrorists without the taxpayers’ approval and without Congressional approval. The court hereby declares it a personal debt and orders the defendant and/or his family and estate to pay the debt owed to America.”\n\nWhat that means is that Obama will give up $160 million he and his wife scammed in book deals as well as the $104 million they’ve made speaking to refugee camps overseas. The rest of the debt will come from their pension unless someone like George Soros steps in and pays his debt for him.\n\nObama and his lawyers argued that a decision made in the interests of national security can’t be directed at the man but rather the office:\n\n“This is f*cking ridiculous.”\n\nThat was really all he needed to say.

"Silent On Shooting Of Congressman, Obama Reemerges To Praise Former Drug Dealer\nFormer president Barack Obama has been shooting his mouth off about everything lately.\n\nHe doesn't like President Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, hates his new budget proposal and really can't stand the Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. On each topic, Obama has been highly vocal, seeking out media coverage.\n\nBut when a Republican congressman was shot and badly wounded last week during a practice for a bipartisan congressional baseball game — silence. Not a peep.\n\nYet Obama did reappear to praise former crack cocaine dealer and one-time thug Jay-Z in a video for his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nJay-Z, real name Shawn Corey Carter, has spoken often of his drug dealing days. “One person who spent time with both Jay Z and DeHaven [Irby] during the early 1990s estimates that Jay Z was moving a kilogram of cocaine (a $12,000 value before the fourfold street markup) per week,” wrote Zack Greenberg in a book titled Empire State of Mind, Daily Beast reported. “‘He was definitely involved in the narcotics game,’ says the source, who asked to remain anonymous. ‘There’s no denying that.’”\n\nOf course, Jay-Z has made a good life since. He's settled down, become a gazillionaire and is married to Beyonce.\n\nStill, it's just a bit odd that Obama said nothing about the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise, but makes time to praise the one-time thug.\n\nOh, and get a dig in at the uncool president now, Donald Trump.\n\n“I’m pretty sure I’m still the only president to listen to Jay Z’s music in the Oval Office,” Obama said in the brief video. “That may change at some point but I’m pretty sure that’s true now.”\n\nTypical Obama.","http://www.dailywire.com/news/17652/silent-shooting-congressman-obama-reemerges-praise-joseph-curl#/","1497797457.0"
"Don't look now, but Arctic sea ice mass has grown almost 40% since 2012\n(Natural News) One of the most popular pieces of “evidence” that climate alarmists just love to bring up to prove the global warming narrative is the “all the ice is melting in the Arctic and the polar bears are dying” line. We’ve all seen the documentaries where a polar bear is desperately clinging to a tiny piece of ice and you just know he’s going to die soon. But is any of it really true? What does the latest science really say about the ice in the Arctic circle?\n\nEarlier this month, Climate Depot reported that the latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent since 2012.\n\nThe Danish Polar Portal, which monitors ice and climate in the Arctic, reported on the 12th of September this year:\n\nThere has been quite some discussion about Greenland in the climate blogosphere this year. Heavy snow and rain in winter with a relatively short and intermittent summer melt season have left the Greenland ice sheet with more ice than has been usual over the last twenty years – in fact we have to go back to the 1980s and 90s to see a year similar to this one in terms of snow fall and ice melt, though perhaps not for iceberg calving. …\n\nIf we rank the annual surface mass balance since 1981 from low to high, the lowest on record was 2011-2012 (38 Gt) and this year is the 5th highest out of the 37 year record. The highest on record 1995-1996 had an end of year SMB of 619 Gt in our records. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn fact, Greenland experienced a 10 times higher level of surface ice than it did five years ago. And confirming that this is not a fluke occurrence taking place in only one year, Greenland’s most well-known glacier – the Petermann Glacier – has been growing slowly and steadily for the past five years.\n\nSponsored solution from the Health Ranger Store: The Big Berkey water filter removes almost 100% of all contaminants using only the power of gravity (no electricity needed, works completely off-grid). Widely consider the ultimate 'survival' water filter, the Big Berkey is made of stainless steel and has been laboratory verified for high-efficiency removal of heavy metals by CWC Labs, with tests personally conducted by Mike Adams. Explore more here.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, the sea ice growth for 2016 – 2017 is much higher than the mean from 1981 – 2010:\n\nThis has been the pattern in the Arctic over the last few years. Back in 2015, BBC News reported that Arctic ice had grown by a staggering 30 percent after what they called an “unusually cool summer” – unusual indeed, if the global warming narrative is to be believed. That trajectory continued into 2014, and the increases in ice for those two years exceeded all recorded losses in the preceding three years. (Related: Mercury pollution contaminating Arctic wildlife, causing death and reproductive problems among bird populations, studies show.)\n\nThat 30 percent constituted a massive amount of physical land area – the Daily Mail reported at the time that a cooler Arctic summer had left over 530,000 additional square miles of ice than the previous year.\n\nAstoundingly, the mainstream media, in spite of having this information at their fingertips, continues to spout the same old global warming nonsense.\n\nIn the very same BBC article cited earlier, for example, the writer immediately insisted that “2013 was a one-off” and went on to stress that the Arctic region had warmed more than most other places on Earth over the past three decades. (Related: Discover the truth at ClimateScienceNews.com)\n\nIt’s understandable that a trend of continuous heating for 30 years would raise concerns, but by the same token, a continuous cooling trend over the last five years must also be taken into consideration. Scientists are supposed to go where the evidence takes them, not try to keep editing the evidence to fit a predetermined outcome.\n\nIt’s like scientists, governments and the mainstream media have all decided that the Earth is warming, and now there’s no turning back. No matter what the physical evidence shows, they’re all just going to save face by insisting that they were right all along.\n\nSources include:\n\nClimateDepot.com\n\nPolarPortal.dk\n\nBBC.com\n\nDailyMail.co.uk","https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-10-01-arctic-sea-ice-mass-has-grown-almost-40-since-2012.html#/","1506830400.0"
"NPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton ‘Completely Fake’ – She Lost Popular Vote\nA study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin.\n\nA study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million “registered voters”.\n\nAccording to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and “multiple state” voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race.\n\nInfowars.com reports:\n\n“A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate,” NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats.\n\nAnd many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that there’s likely more dead and invalid voters than before.\n\n“…The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state,” NPR added.\n\nThat’s because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency.\n\nUnder the “catch and release” immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off.\n\nClinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump – and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes.\n\nA portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and it’s worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate.\n\nThat said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president.\n\nWithout the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states.\n\nYet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election.\n\nHowever, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.","http://yournewswire.com/npr-25-million-fake-clinton-votes/","1485669228.0"
"Morgan Freeman: 'Jailing Hillary' Best Way To 'Restore Trust In Govt'\nThe best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”\n\n“Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.\n\nResponding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!”\n\nAfter being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“\n\n“The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.”\n\nThe veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.\n\nIn September the Shawshank Redemption star appeared in a viral video demanding President Trump speak directly to the American people about the extent of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.”\n\n“We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans. During this past election, we cam under attack by the Russian government,” Freeman demands Trump to say, adding, ‘I’ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened.’”","http://yournewswire.com/morgan-freeman-jail-hillary/","1509298264.0"

"Georgia Becomes First State To BAN Muslim Culture In Historic Move To Restore Western Culture\nWhen Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.\n\nWhether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States.\n\nA Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils.\n\nState Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.\n\nSpencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.\n\n“This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.\n\nMany people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.\n\nHere is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible?\n\nQuran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.\n\nI will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.\n\nFight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority.\n\nIs that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities?\n\nJust for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different?\n\nThere is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe.\n\nWhile Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation.\n\nThe threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans.\n\nThis move is about keeping the American people safe. Under President Trump, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the American people safe.","https://conservativedailypost.com/georgia-becomes-first-state-to-ban-muslim-culture-in-historic-move-to-restore-western-culture/","1479404577.0"

Hannity’s bump and bruise fender bender with a Ford Pickup truck did far more damage than originally thought. The nurse told Crossroads correspondent Louis LeWeigh:\n\n“Mr. Hannity isn’t going to survive. At this time they’re calling in close friends and family so he can share goodbyes. It’s very sad. He’s awake and lucid and while he’s in a lot of pain, he’s in good spirits. He cried for a solid ten minutes when we told him his injusries were fatal. He couldn’t believe God already wanted him home.”\n\nHannity has already been given the last rights by his priest and is now sitting with his mother and younger sister. Fox and the other networks have still made no announcements, possibly at the family’s request.\n\nThere has been no talk yet of funerals or burial.

"CONFIRMED ! JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG IS RESIGNING FROM THE POST OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT\nIf this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump.\n\nShe said she will resign if Trump was elected President, and now when he got elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November.

"Spicer: “Trump Has The Legal Right To Cancel SCOTUS Because They Serve At His Pleasure”\nDuring a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. “If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “That is a fact.”\n\nAsked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – Spicer argued that the Constitution “clearly states” what the President of the United States can and cannot do. “However,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.”\n\nSpicer continued, “As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.”\n\n“This is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long.

"Man from Katy, TX who ordered prostitute discovers that she is his own wife\nMan from Katy, TX who ordered prostitute discovers that she is his own wife\n\nA 52-year old man in the Texas city of Katy has made headlines after his attempt to hire a prostitute through an online service ended in a terrible mix-up that will likely cost him his marriage.\n\nIn a story resembling elements of the classic 1979 ‘Piña Colada Song’, the man – who we cannot identify for privacy reasons – had been using the booking website for some months to hire prostitutes and meet them for sex at motels in neighboring areas.\n\nOn the most recent occasion, which occurred last weekend, the man told his wife he was going on a fishing trip with friends, when in reality he was travelling to a motel on the outskirts of town.\n\nUpon checking into the motel on Saturday afternoon the man used his phone to access his regular website used to book prostitutes. According to a statement he made to authorities, he saw the profile of a new 28-year old woman who caught his attention.\n\nAs with many of the photos on the site, the photo only showed the woman from her neck down, but the man is said to have liked what he saw and he sent her a message to see if she was free later that night, and what her price would be for 2 hours.\n\nShe replied back within minutes to confirm she was available, and could meet up with him at the motel that night. The pair agreed on a price of $150, bargained down from her original request of $200.\n\nGuests at the hotel in adjoining rooms called the front desk to report a disturbance at around 8 pm after the woman arrived at the property and found that her client was none other than her husband of the last 17 years.\n\nIt emerged that the prostitute – who had advertised herself as ‘an attractive 28-year old’ – was actually the man’s 49-year old wife. She was understandably furious to find her husband in the motel room, although after further reflection he was equally angry to learn his wife had been advertising her services on a prostitution website.\n\nThe pair have reportedly separated with the wife moving back to her parent’s home in Houston.\n\nFor the husband, he may now face charges under the state’s tough prostitution laws, which make it illegal to engage in any type of sexual activity in exchange for money or some other form of compensation – even if it is with one’s own spouse.\n\nIn other news making headlines, a popular nightclub in Phoenix, Arizona has been forced to close temporarily after human faeces were discovered on the dance floor.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.unitednews.org/man-from-katy-tx-ordered-prostitute-discovers-wife/","1501189725.0"
"BREAKING: Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It\nCNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trump’s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.\n\nDonald Trump’s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.\n\nThe construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.\n\nThe pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.\n\nOpposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.\n\nThe opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump’s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.\n\nVeterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.\n\nAnd now we learn that “President” Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.\n\nThis should come as no surprise since Trump �?s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.\n\nThis involvement is another example of Trump’s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.\n\nAccording to Ethics experts, Trump’s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.\n\nThe blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.\n\nThe Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump’s support of the cruel actions of the police.\n\nWe must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.\n\nPlease share this story on Facebook!","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.learnprogress.org/trump-caught-investing-pipeline/","1486601019.0"
"AWFUL: Top Democrats Refuse To Stand, Clap For Navy SEAL Widow Honored By Trump\nOn Tuesday evening, President Trump spoke to a joint session of Congress – and gave what was obviously the best speech of his career. The best moment was obvious, too: his tribute to the widow of Navy SEAL William ‘Ryan’ Owens:\n\nTrump stated:\n\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero — battling against terrorism and securing our nation. I just spoke to General [Jim] Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.” Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom — we will never forget him.\n\nDemocrats initially stood for the widow. But then they sat.\n\nTrump didn't.\n\nAs his widow wept and mouthed to heaven, “I love you, baby,” Trump led a round of applause that lasted two minutes.\n\nAnd House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) apparently sat there and didn’t cheer as the incredible moment progressed, along with Senator Bernie Sanders and others – see this video at approximately three minutes in, as the cameras pan the crowd. Look at the right hand side of this screenshot:\n\nHere's another screenshot a few moments later:\n\nMaybe it was more important for Democrats not to cheer in Trump’s presence than to cheer a hero.\n\nSobbing widow of slain Navy Seal receives 2 minute standing ovation.\n\n\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz & Keith Ellison stay firmly seated, no claps — Benny (@bennyjohnson) March 1, 2017\n\nFOR THE RECORD: Carryn Owens had 2 ovations.\n\nDWS & Ellison stood for her intro.\n\nThe really long, emotional 2 min one, they did not stand. — Benny (@bennyjohnson) March 1, 2017\n\nProof that DWS & Ellison stood for the first ovation & not for the 2nd. As I clearly tweeted: Check for yourselfhttps://t.co/LraFf628HM pic.twitter.com/CIV6sOAjyU — Benny (@bennyjohnson) March 1, 2017\n\nNo wonder Democrats aren’t connecting with Americans. Their hatred for Trump is stronger than their love of country.\n\nUPDATE: For purposes of clarity, the lead image on this article has been changed to a screenshot at the contemporaneous time of the two-minute standing ovation for Mrs. Owen. The original image of Wasserman Schultz and Ellison was from a different point in the speech, and could have been misleading, although the article remains correctly reported.","http://www.dailywire.com/news/13970/awful-top-democrats-refuse-stand-clap-navy-seal-ben-shapiro#/","1488338951.0"

"Court orders Tiger Woods to take 137 paternity tests\nMiami, FL | The famous golf star Tiger Woods has taken another hit this morning as a state court ordered him to undergo a total of 137 paternity tests.\n\nThe court’s decision comes after request formulated by 121 women who claim to have been Wood’s mistresses and to have given birth to his children.\n\nMany of the women yelled and cried with joy when the judge announced his verdict, as some of them had been fighting for more than seven years to obtain this judgment.\n\nOne of the women who claim to have had children with the golfer, Molly Sanders, was interviewed by WFNC-TV only minutes after the court announced its decision.\n\n“I’m absolutely ecstatic! My son is eight years old and I’ve been fighting almost his entire life for his right to see his father.”\n\nThe court has given Mr. Woods 30 days to undergo a DNA test or face imprisonment and severe fines.\n\nTiger Woods’ lawyer confirmed that their client would comply with the court’s decision and take all necessary tests.\n\nTiger Woods contributed to the popularity of golf in the 1990s and was the dominant force in golf in the 2000s.\n\nWoods first took leave from professional golf in December 2009 in order to focus on his personal life, after his many alleged extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several women, through many worldwide media sources, leading to his divorce from Elin Nordegren.\n\nSince then, he has been having difficulties on the courses while attracting a lot of attention for his personal problems.\n\nIn the days and months following Woods’ admission of infidelity, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&T, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods.\n\nEarlier this year, the golfer was also implicated in an incident involving drugs and alcohol.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested near Jupiter, Florida by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office at about 3:00 am EDT for driving under the influence of five different types of drugs.\n\nThis new judgment against him will certainly add more pressure on Wood’s shoulders, which means his performances on the golf courses aren’t bound to improve very soon.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/court-orders-tiger-woods-to-take-137-paternity-tests/","1503048900.0"
"BREAKING: 19 Shot During Anti-Gun March – Media DEAD SILENT\nShare this post: Reddit\n\nThousands of protesters stormed the streets this weekend for the “March For Our Lives” event against guns, Donald Trump, NRA, violence, and assault weapons which most people could not define. Without knowing it, the thousands of people who attended the event were secretly funded by people with an anti-gun agenda who somehow tricked all these people into marching to take away their own rights.\n\nPeople in attendance paraded around town with their inaccurate and false protest signs and the mainstream media paid plenty of attention to the marchers. The mainstream media was so busy focusing on the anti-everything march of future Democrat voters that they forgot to mention the shootings that erupted while people were marching.\n\nWithout realizing it, the people who participated in the march were used as pawns to push a Democrat agenda. They consistently carried signs that made no sense, were factually inaccurate, or lacked proper spelling because they are not paying enough attention in class.\n\nStudents claimed that politicians were paid for by the NRA, but the student protesters didn’t realize that they themselves were paid for as well. People paid for them to travel, and if their travel wasn’t paid for, then they probably would not have attended.\n\nTeen protesters such as David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez voiced their opinions. David Hogg was criticized immediately after his salute to the crowd looked nearly identical to that of Adolf Hitler with a straight right arm high in the air. It was very inappropriate and highly irresponsible, but it showed the lack of knowledge of basic history.\n\nThe protesters hogged all the media attention while real victims were riddled with bullets in Chicago. 19 people in Chicago were shot over the weekend while the anti-gun march took all the spotlight without paying any attention to the people who were being shot.\n\nThe victims are now suffering from their wounds, or deceased, and this all happened in a Democrat city that has extremely tough gun laws. So far only one person who was shot has passed away from their injuries. Keep in mind that this is only one city and there were numerous other violent crimes across the country.\n\nThe Sun Times reported more about the grueling statistics from Chicago: “A man was killed and at least 18 other people were wounded in weekend shootings across Chicago.\n\nThe weekend’s only fatal shooting happened early Sunday in the Back of the Yards neighborhood on the South Side. The man, whose age wasn’t immediately known, was found with a gunshot wound to the head about 4 a.m. in the 1900 block of West 52nd Street, according to Chicago Police. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office hasn’t released his identity.\n\nThe weekend’s most recent shooting happened early Monday in the Logan Square neighborhood on the Northwest Side. A 34-year-old man was standing on a sidewalk at 12:11 a.m. in the 2600 block of North Harding when two males walked up to him and fired shots, police said. He suffered a graze wound to the right ankle and was taken to Norwegian American Hospital in good condition.\n\nAbout two hours earlier, A 17-year-old boy was wounded in a Logan Square neighborhood shooting on the Northwest Side. The boy was walking on a sidewalk about 10:10 p.m. Sunday in the 1700 block of North Western Avenue when someone drove up and fired shots, striking him in the right arm police said. He showed up at Saints Mary and Elizabeth Medical Center before being transferred to Stroger Hospital in good condition.\n\nAnother teenage boy was shot about 7:15 p.m. Sunday in the Gage Park neighborhood on the Southwest Side. The 15-year-old was standing in the 5700 block of South Mozart when a someone in a passing light-colored sedan fired shots, striking him in his arm, police said. He was taken to Holy Cross Hospital, where his condition stabilized.\n\nEarlier that evening, a woman was grazed by a bullet in the West Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side. The 46-year-old was arguing with someone about 5:50 p.m. in the 4600 block of West Jackson Avenue when they pulled out a handgun and fired shots, striking her in the upper right thigh, police said. She was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in good condition. The shooter ran off from the scene.\n\nLess than an hour earlier, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the West Side’s West Garfield Park neighborhood. The boy suffered a gunshot wound to the back about 5:15 p.m. in the 4600 block of West Erie, police said. He showed up at West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park before being transferred to Stroger in good condition.\n\nTwo men were wounded in a drive-by shooting a few hours earlier in the West Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side. At 2:21 p.m. the men, ages 27 and 30, were in the 4200 block of West Van Buren when a light-colored sedan pulled up and someone inside opened fire, according to police.\n\nThe younger man suffered gunshot wounds to the buttocks and abdomen, while the older man was shot in his arm. They were both taken to Mount Sinai, where the younger man was listed in fair condition and the older man was in good condition.”\n\nChicago is just one city of many in which there were shootings committed by people who do not follow the law. There were also numerous other violent crimes in which guns were not used. Violence is a problem, and many weapons can be used. Everything from fists, guns, and other inanimate objects are capable of being used to cause injury to people in acts of domestic violence and murder.\n\nThe mainstream media often refuses to pay more attention to the victims of senseless violence. The Democrat party prefers to focus on the weapon of choice and utilize the students as pawns in their anti-gun agenda. The real problem is that people don’t follow laws and that our country has a lot of people who have some mental health issues that need to be addressed.\n\nAmerica also has a drug problem. The common factor is that there is a people problem and they use anything to inflict harm on themselves and others.\n\nIt’s time for the mainstream media and the Democrat party to pay more attention to the people problem and get help for those who need it.","http://bettertrump.com/2018/03/breaking-19-shot-during-anti-gun-march-media-dead-silent/","1522158307.0"

"George W. Bush Breaks Silence With Incredible Statement About President Trump\nAs Donald Trump stepped in his new role as the President of the United States, he was faced with a real chaos.

"Trump Sends Feds To Raid NY’s Islamberg After 20yrs They Uncover America’s WORST Nightmare -\nAs FreedomDaily Reported:\n\nNOTE ***This story has been updated since its original publication as more details became available.\n\nThere’s a mysterious hidden Muslim compound called Islamberg that’s nestled deep within the woods of the Catskill mountains in New York. The only way to access the 70-acre compound is through primitive dirt roads, where more than 100 Muslims live in seclusion away from the prying eyes of curious Americans. For over two decades, infidels have been prohibited from entering, as anyone attempting to enter will be “greeted” by armed Muslims patrolling a guard shack at the compound’s entry gate. Without access to the compound, there’s been no way to confirm rumors about the location being used as a training ground for Muslim terrorists. But after an alarming incident involving one of the Islamberg residents, police got involved. And what they discovered that these Muslims have been quietly plotting for years is nothing short of chilling.\n\nFor over two decades, this cult-like group of Sharia Law-following Muslims have lived quietly under the guidance of Pakistani Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani, a radical Muslim with known ties to Jamaat al-Fuqra, a terror organization responsible for a long list of terrorist activities around the world, including murders of rival religious figures in the United States. Locals in the area have often times reported the sounds of gunfire and explosions emanating from the compound, but because the Muslims weren’t necessarily breaking any laws, there was nothing that law enforcement could do except keep a close eye on the place from a distance.\n\nBut with a recent arrest of Islamberg resident Ramadan Abdullah who was recently caught trying to steal several cases of ammunition from a local mountain store in the area, authorities finally had their chance to investigate the man’s background. And they quickly learned that Abdullah was stockpiling weapons for the compound:\n\n“A long-time associate of a U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), has been arrested in New York following the discovery of a large cache of weapons that were intended for MOA’s “Islamberg” headquarters in Hancock, NY,” Dennis Michael Lynch reported.\n\nShortly after arresting Ramadan Abdullah for theft, the Muslim’s answers about why he was stealing ammunition raised suspicion among police, who then decided to obtain a search warrant to investigate their suspicions further. During their raid they discovered a massive stockpile of illegal weapons that were to be transported to the compound, including 8 assault weapons, 4 loaded handguns, 1 loaded shotgun, 2 rifles, 64 high-capacity ammunition feeding devices, and body armor, including thousands of rounds of .50 caliber ammunition capable of piercing body armor. But illegal cache of weapons seized from Abdullah was unfortunately just the beginning.\n\nAfter Abdullah’s arrest, authorities began looking closer into his background, discovering that the Muslim is a long-time associate of the U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), and was the very same Muslim who was arrested back in 1977 after police discovered enough material at his home to build 50 bombs.\n\nAbdullah also participated in the armed robbery of a candy store in Brooklyn back in the 70’s that resulted in the death of a man. But after serving time and having his sentence drastically reduced, Abdullah had pretty much fallen off the radar of authorities, quietly living on the Islamberg compound and training other terrorists on the use of weapons. His arrest has now validated the fears that New York residents held all along that the compound was in fact location being used to actively train terrorists, where FOX News is now coming forward with other possible rumors of there being a tank on the grounds as well, and that the location was once used to hide Osama bin Laden from authorities.\n\nSince Abdullah’s arrest, New York State Police Major Jim Barnes said he believes that the Muslim terrorist has traveled overseas to promote terrorism. All Abdullah’s illegal weapons have since been seized, and Barnes questions exactly what Abdullah’s motives were for hording such a massive amount of weapons in the first place.\n\n“… it begs the question, what was he doing with all this and what were his intentions down the road?” Barnes said.\n\nThankfully, Abdullah is being held without bail at the Broome County Jail.\n\nOn several occasions, political pundit Dennis Michael Lynch has reported on the alarming things going on in Islamberg, exposing how 22 other training camps within the United States are directly associated with the MOA terror network and Ramadan Abdullah. Below is a chilling mini-documentary he did on Islamberg. Watch for yourself and ask: just what exactly is in that U-Haul truck?\n\nIt’s absolutely ridiculous that Muslims in this country are allowed to have their own freaking jihadi compounds, where they’re actively training their residents on the necessary tactics to carry out terror attacks! While Americans are protected under the Constitution against illegal searches and seizures, when known freaking terrorists are leading these compounds, it’s time to stop letting these Muslims hide behind our laws and put them all in GITMO where they belong!\n\nRead more on this: [FreedomDaily] [Dennis Michael Lynch]","https://independentminute.com/2018/04/01/trump-sends-feds-to-raid-nys-islamberg-after-20yrs/","1522555200.0"

"Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: “Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer”\nThe research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the “chief scientist” is supposed to be the leader “among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.” President Donald Trump’s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn’t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.\n\nWhen asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was “proud” he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because “scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.” Asked to elaborate, he said that he was “glad” to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, “disappointed” as to where he was assigned. “While I can certainly appreciate President Trump’s reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I can’t help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,” he said. “I do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, they’re just wasting their time.”\n\n“When I get back home from work – believe me – I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,” Clovis continued. “I’m proud I’m not one of them because they believe in things like evolution and the like. They have no fear from God, no understanding of things that they can’t see, taste, smell, touch or hear. If you ask me, that’s a pretty limited way for one to live their life. And you want to know what the irony is? They’re the ones who keep calling us traditional and conservative. They, who refuse to believe God made man because they found some sort of so-called evidence that man derived from monkeys or whatever. They’re so narrow-minded that they can’t except that we’re different and then they go around calling us the conservatives. It’s funny when you really think about it.”\n\n“That’s why I’m happy I’m not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They don’t even consider the fact that there’s more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. It’s as funny as it is pitiful,” he said. When asked why he continues to work as president Trump’s pick for top scientist if that’s how he feels about it, he replied, “Well, just because you’re a member of the Trump administration doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,” Clovis concluded.","http://politicops.com/trumps-top-scientist-pick-scientists-just-dumb-regular-people-think-dinosaurs-existed-earth-getting-warmer/","1494792802.0"

Meshner for about five minutes and told him he can either find a new host for the Late Show or kiss his network’s White House press credentials goodbye. The New York Times is already calling it blackmail because they love to put out fake news headlines.\n\nColbert’s lawyer says the comedian will be filing suit against CBS and President Trump. He claims that not only is CBS in breach of contract but that Trump violated federal law when he used the Office of the President to carry out an act of “revenge.” What he doesn’t weem to get is that Trump is the chief executive and can pretty much do whatever he wants if it’s in the best interest of the country, which this is.\n\nMaybe Colbert should go back to Comedy Central where he belongs.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-trump-makes-one-phone-call-stephen-colbert-fired/","1493987091.0"
"Pfizer Vice President blows whistle on Gardasil: “The vaccine is deadly”\nThe former vice president of Pfizer, Dr. Peter Rost, can be seen in the video clip below, discussing what many of us have been saying for years: the Gardasil vaccine is dangerous and Big Pharma just wants to keep people unhealthy. The clip below, taken from the yet to be released “One More Girl” documentary – features Dr. Rost revealing how vaccines and Big Pharma drugs are designed to keep people in a state of dis-ease.\n\nNOTE: Dr. Rost doesn’t directly say “Gardasil is dangerous” but he’s discussing the vaccine in the documentary “Gardasil: One More Girl.” Again, the topic IS THE GARDASIL VACCINE. Although he might not use the words, that vaccine is the topic of the interview.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\n(It is also important to note that the One More Girl project seemed to stall. No one is sure how or why, or even where the filmmakers went. They started a Kickstarter campaign to begin their project, filmed for three months, cut a trailer, updated everyone with a release date and then disappeared. Their website is no longer active, neither is their Facebook account or YouTube channel, although there are a couple of video clips from OMG. Did someone scare them off their trail?)\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nCheck out the two quotes below which touch on what Dr. Rost is discussing in the video above: “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.” – Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime editor-in-chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ) “ “The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.” – Dr. Richard Horton, the current editor-in-chief of the Lancet – considered to be one of the most well respected peer-reviewed medical journals in the world. RELATED STORY: Erin got the Gardasil Shot, then she got Cervical Cancer\n\nWe cannot trust the mainstream media to bring these quotes and this truth to our attention, in spite of the fact that they paint quite a bleak picture about the state of things.

William Smith, 28 from Dallas, Texas was discovered in the early hours of Tuesday morning, decapitated and left outside the front door of a judge who had granted him bail in August. Smith had been arrested last month following complaints from his ex-girlfriend that he had raped her 8-year-old daughter. Following his arrest, he was charged with two counts related to child pornography and one count of child molestation.\n\nAfter being charged, Smith was held on a $30,000 bail which he was able to pay and walked free from the court. The judge granted bail after ruling that Smith didn't pose a threat to the local community. The victim's family said they were 'shocked' that her rapist had been allowed to walk free from court.

"United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight\nDuring a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.\n\nThe baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”\n\nAfter the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.\n\nThe flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.\n\nThe little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries.

"Police Officers, Firefighters and Others Get Hit with Tax Penalty\nWe all know that the recently passed tax bill is likely the single worst piece of legislation in the history of American politics. You know it, I know it, Paul Ryan knows it, Donald Trump knows it. Well, Trump probably doesn’t, because, well, he’s delusional.\n\nBut it’s really, really bad. And historically unpopular, like the President whose name will forever be attached to it.\n\nMaybe you aren’t totally convinced about how bad it is yet. So there’s this: Under this plan, a wealthy CEO can deduct a private jet, but a police officer cannot deduct his/her uniform.\n\n“Yeah, but they’re the party of ‘Blue Lives Matter’ and thanking everyone who ever wore a uniform for anything for their service!” you might say. And I have some oceanfront property in Idaho to sell you if you believe that.\n\nSalon reports, Donald Trump often declares his support, even love, for police, firefighters and other first responders. That isn’t stopping him, however, from nicking their wallets in the new tax law that he is expected to sign in early January.\n\nBuried in the hastily drafted tax bill’s more than 500 pages are provisions eliminating “miscellaneous” deductions taken by almost 28 million taxpayers in 2015. Those are costs you bore to support your job or an investment you own or to pay a professional to prepare your income tax return.\n\nThis year cops and other first responders can write off the costs of buying uniforms and dry cleaning them. But in 2018, cops who buy their uniforms or are required to buy their own guns and ammunition will no longer be able to deduct those costs as reasonable and necessary expenses to support their earning a paycheck, thanks to Trump and Congressional Republicans.\n\nBut that’s not all. Cops and anyone else who belongs to a union will no longer be allowed to deduct their union dues. People who must bear travel costs without reimbursement from their employers will just have to suck it up starting in January.\n\nAdd police officers, the military, teachers, nurses and first responders to the long, long list of hard working Americans that Donald Trump and the Republican party want to make suffer.

Investigators from Scotland Yard are currently working with MI5 and the United States FBI to figure out exactly what transpired here today.\n\nObviously, Assange has many enemies, none who would want to see him dead than Hillary Clinton. According to Chief Investigator Nigel Hollister, Assange wasn’t simply kidnapped and killed; he endured what looks like hours of advanced interrogation techniques. His finger and toenails had been removed and his testicles were crushed with what may have been a small sledgehammer.\n\nIntelligence agencies are now combing through the crime scenes both in the alley and in the room in the embassy he occupied for nearly five years to see if they can find any evidence of the attackers, who are now wanted for three counts of murder, conspiracy, torture and kidnapping.

"Teacher arrested for stapling a “loudmouth” student’s lips shut\nSpringfield, Missouri | A 61-year old high school teacher was arrested this morning, after she allegedly assaulted a student with a stapler in order to “keep his mouth shut”.\n\nAccording to witnesses at the Central High School, Dorothy Fransen was furious after one of her students, 17-year old Jeremy Dunlop, kept interrupting her class and making jokes about her physical appearance.\n\nShe reportedly tackled the young man and held him on the ground while stapling his lips more than 45 times.\n\nAmanda Jones, one of the victim’s classmates who witnessed the whole incident, says that the teacher “completely lost it” after the young man made a joke about her weight.\n\n“She was just enraged! She yelled ‘This will shut you up, you little fucker!’ and just jumped on him. She held him down and then she began stapling his lips over and over again.”\n\nAnother witness, Justin Reynolds, says he tried to help his classmate, but was kicked by the infuriated teacher.\n\n“I tried to pull her off Jeremy and the first time she violently pushed me away. When I tried again, she kicked me in the guts with her high heels.”\n\nFortunately, two officers of the Springfield Missouri Police Department were already on the site and Ms Fransen was arrested less than five minutes after the beginning of the assault.\n\nMs Fransen now faces a total of 21 criminal charges, including 5 charges of aggravated assault, and could now face up to 110 years in jail.\n\nHer lawyer, Robert Monroe, says that her violent reaction was due to the fact that she was being harassed by Mr Dunlop on a regular basis.\n\nMr Monroe claims that Ms Fransen is in fact the victim in this story, and that she “temporarily lost contact with reality” as a result of the harassment.\n\nShe is expected to appear in court in May, but her lawyer has already announced that she would plea “not guilty”.","https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/teacher-arrested-for-stapling-a-loudmouth-students-lips-shut/","1491570753.0"

"French President Offers Refugee Status to U.S. Liberals\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is offering refuge to American liberals upset at President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nIn a video posted to Twitter, speaking in English, Macron said:\n\n“I wish to tell the United States: France believes in you. The world believes in you. I know that you are a great nation. I know your history, our common history.”\n\n“If you’re wondering how to get into France, you can either be a Syrian [jihadi] or an American climate scientist.”\n\n“To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second homeland. I call them: Come and work here, with us, to work together on concrete solutions for our climate, our environment. I can assure you, France will not give up the fight.”\n\nMacron also posted a picture to Twitter, with the words “Make Our Planet Great Again” on a green and blue background.\n\nMacron is a 39-year-old liberal who worked in mergers and acquisitions for the Rothschild investment bank in Paris and as the economy minister to French Socialist Party President François Hollande before rebranding himself as an “outsider” last year and launching a campaign for president.\n\nHe defeated populist National Front leader Marine Le Pen in May to become the youngest-ever president of France.\n\nIt may be because of his youth that Macron is not aware that the specter of a young Frenchman calling out the president of the United States, speaking English with a French accent, may invite more ridicule from Americans than gratitude.\n\n'If you're wondering how to get into France, you can either be a Syrian [jihadi] or an American climate scientist,' newspaper columnist and talk radio guest host Mark Steyn said on 'The Rush Limbaugh Show' on Friday afternoon, before noting that France would likely require more paperwork from the American climate scientist than from the jihadi.\n\nAnd as for President Trump himself, The Washington Post reported Friday that Trump's irritation with Macron's disrespecting him at their first meeting may have, in fact, helped seal his decision on withdrawal from the Paris accord.\n\nIt occurred in Brussels, Belgium, on May 26, when the new French president approached the line of world leaders, with Trump in the middle, but veered off to his right. He ignored Trump to shake German Chancellor Angela Merkel's hand first, and then the hand of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenburg. Only then did he finally face Trump, who clasped Macron's hand tightly and pulled the slender Macron toward him forcefully while shaking his hand vigorously, breaking out into a huge smile — not at Macron, but toward the cameras that he saw were pointed toward him.\n\nAt an earlier private meeting between Macron and Trump, the two had shaken hands, with both gripping tightly and grimacing for the cameras, in what some media organizations interpreted as an alpha male showdown.\n\nIn what was likely the best, or probably the most memorable, line from the president's energetic address from the Rose Garden on Thursday, in which he laid out a strong case for exiting the Paris agreement, he said: 'I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.'","http://www.lifezette.com/polizette/french-president-offers-refugee-status-u-s-liberals/","1496428389.0"

"Maine House Democrats Vote to Allow Female Genital Mutilation – Minuteman Militia\nFollowing swift action from Maine House Democrats on the last day of the legislative session, there will be no Female Genital Mutilation ban in the Pine Tree State.\n\nAfter months of pretending they wanted to stop the barbaric ritual child abuse of FGM, the Democrat caucus showed their true colors on the issue late Wednesday night.\n\nBy a final vote of 77-70, the House killed the FGM ban in a mostly party-line vote. Rep. Cathy Nadeau (D-Winslow) was the only Democrat who crossed the aisle to protect young daughters of immigrants in Maine from this brutal abuse.\n\nYou can see a full roll-call vote by clicking here.\n\nRepublican Rep. Heather Sirocki of Scarborough points out Democrats voted to kill an FGM Ban in April, which is Child Abuse Prevention Month. And in fact, they did it on the “Week of the Young Child.”\n\nRep. Sirocki says Maine House Democrats initially decided to table the bill with the intent of letting it cowardly die without the courtesy of a vote. However, supporters of the ban made their voices heard.\n\n“Playing games with a child abuse bill is shameful,” Rep. Sirocki said. “Finally, after hours of phone calls from all over the country and state urging Speaker Gideon to relent, she brought the bill to the Floor at 10:30 pm. The Democrats like to talk about victims’ rights, women’s rights, child advocacy, human rights, and justice — but their votes on this horrific form of child abuse do not back up all of their talk.”\n\nThe same FGM Ban bill killed in the House, passed the State Senate 30-5, with only the most far-Left Senators voting against it.\n\nLast week House Democrats passed a toothless bill that wouldn’t actually ban FGM. Rep. Karen Gerrish of Lebanon called the show-vote a sad state of affairs for young, female Mainers.\n\n“It was a feel-good vote that I suppose will make it appear that they voted to ban FGM — they did not,” Rep. Gerrish said.\n\nBut late Wednesday night the show was over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Democrats threw a tantrum in the wake of Republicans voting against extending the legislative session. The FGM ban was one of several critical bills Democrats killed in a matter of hours. In fact, it was jaw-dropping to watch, after months of little action from the House, Democrat “leadership” managed to pull together votes to kill a handful of good bills in just a matter of hours. The breakneck speed makes one question what “leadership” has been doing all session.\n\nIf you’re having a difficult time comprehending how any legislators could be against banning Female Genital Mutilation, the opposition has made their reasoning very clear. They fear offending the immigrant community and being labeled “racist.”\n\nFemale Genital Mutilation is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. In some cultures, the vulva is sewn shut, only to be ripped open on the woman’s wedding night.\n\nThe practice is designed to curb sexual desire in women.\n\nAlong with significant health risk to the young girls, women who suffer Female Genital Mutilation are left with life-long physical and emotional scarring.\n\nTo learn more about the horrific abuse, listen to FGM survivor, F.A. Cole’s testimony in front of the CJPS Committee. Cole fights through a panic attack to share her story with Maine Legislators in the hope it would save young daughters of Maine immigrants from suffering through the same terrifying experience.\n\nShare this: Print\n\n","https://www.minuteman-militia.com/2018/04/25/maine-house-democrats-vote-to-allow-female-genital-mutilation/","1524628800.0"

While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London’s Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.\n\nIn an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. “We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,” Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.\n\nSputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:\n\n“The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.”\n\n“It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.”\n\nMillions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don’t take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian compares the law to Hitler:\n\n“There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists – and even “moderate” Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.”\n\nYes, that’s right—because apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow “intolerant.” Well do you know what most Americans think?\n\nYou’re damn right it’s intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500’s AD? We shouldn’t! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.\n\nThankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is “unfair,” and “discriminates,” against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.\n\nDespite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there—6th safest in the world, to be exact.\n\n“Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.”\n\nAfter the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.\n\nWith the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.","http://www.patriotnetwork.one/2018/04/27/breaking-czech-republic-arms-citizens-you-can-now-shoot-terrorists-on-sight/","1524801600.0"
"Donald Trump Signs Executive Order On Climate Change: “It’s Real And We Need To Do Something About It Now”\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Early this morning, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order that has pundits on both sides of the aisle in a state of disbelief. Executive Order 756843, signed by the President at 2:45 a.m. EST, declares that climate change is an immediate threat both to the economy and to national security. It directs government agencies to develop action plans to reduce their carbon footprints and reverses a previous order by Trump that was intended to encourage the development of two controversial pipeline projects. It also lifts the gag order that Trump had placed on government scientists and directs congress to pass legislation aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the U.S. by 20 percent over the next five years.\n\n“I have a very wonderful brain,” Trump told reporters during an impromptu press conference. “I mean, it’s really fantastic, but I am also a very busy and an important man. So even when you have a brain as good as mine, the best brain, the greatest brain, you sometimes miss things. I’ve spoken with some of the top scientists here in Washington, and let me tell you, I trust these guys. They showed me without a doubt that climate change is real and and we need to do something about it now. Even the best brain, a brain such as mine, can sometimes be wrong.”\n\nTrump tweeted his new stance this morning on climate change by stating, “Climate change is real folks, get on board the Trump train with this one!”\n\nThis is a sudden and radical change for Trump, who spent most of his campaign saying that climate change is a hoax and who once said that climate change was created by the Chinese to weaken U.S. manufacturing. The president also stated that a growing resistance movement among government scientists had little to no impact on his decision.\n\nClimate change refers to the rise in average surface temperatures on Earth. An overwhelming scientific consensus maintains that climate change is due primarily to the human use of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air.\n\nPaul Horner, a climate researcher at UCLA, says that he is pleased with the President’s decision, but remains skeptical about President Trump’s long term plans.\n\n“Obviously, it is a good thing when the leader of the world’s most powerful country acknowledges that climate change is real. Even with swift action now we still continue to see rising sea levels, more frequent drought in some areas, couple with increased rain in others, more powerful hurricanes, and rapid ice melt in the Arctic. Still, I’m not quite sure that I trust him to see it through with this. Who knows when he’ll change his mind again?”\n\nRight wing radio personality and well known Trump supporter Alex Jones told his listeners that he feels betrayed by the new Executive Order. During a 20 minute long diatribe, he suggested that Trump was a practicing Satanist and accused the president of sacrificing newborn infants and engaging in acts of bestiality. Jones concluded his rant by saying, “It’s game over folks. They’ve got him. The globalists have compromised Donald Trump. You can kiss this country goodbye for good.”\n\nDespite Jones’ objections, most Americans, including many Republicans, support Trump’s new order. Preliminary results from a CNN poll show that 71 percent of Americans support the Executive Order. While opinion is split along party lines, nearly a quarter of republicans say they support the move.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the Executive Order.\n\n“This is a story about President Trump acknowledging that climate change is real.” Bradley said. “I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps .”\n\nTrump’s signing of Executive Order 756843 has managed to earn him praise from an unexpected source. Former President Barack Obama has issued an official press release which lauds President Trump for his “immense courage in putting what’s best for the planet and the country ahead of partisan politics.”\n\nThe Trump Administration has setup a special hotline for those with any questions or concerns regarding Executive Order 756843. The number for that hotline is (785) 273-0325.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://cnn.com.de/news/donald-trump-changes-opinion-climate-change-real/","1486626359.0"
"Plane accidentally empties toilet tank over cruise ship, 23 injured\nPassengers of a cruise ship sailing off the coast of Hawaii had an extremely unpleasant surprise this morning, when chunks of frozen human waste fell on them from the sky.\n\nA Boeing 777 airplane belonging to the Taiwanese airline EVA Air, dumped human excreta midair while traveling from Japan to Hawaii.\n\nUnfortunately, the content of the toilet tank was jettisoned into the sky while the plane was flying over the cruise liner Lady of the Pacific, which was hit by “large chunks of blue ice”.\n\nHundreds of passengers were standing on the top deck at the time, and many were hit by ice projectiles weighing up to 10 lbs.\n\nJanis Garrison, a passenger who witnessed the whole incident, says the ice appeared very suddenly and took everyone by surprise.\n\n“Large chunks of ice appeared out of nowhere and began falling everywhere. It happened so fast that many people were hurt without knowing what hit them.”\n\nFive passengers were critically injured and 18 more were severely hurt, but the ship’s medical staff intervened rapidly and was able to stabilize all of the victims.\n\nThe ship was rapidly redirected to Hawaii to undergo some repair and to allow the injured passengers to obtain better medical care.\n\nSome of them could need weeks of care before they can go back to their regular life.\n\nNorth Pacific Cruise Lines, who own and operate the Lady of the Pacific, confirmed they would file a lawsuit against the Taiwanese airline.\n\nAccording to international law, dumping of lavatory waste is illegal, so EVA Air could also face some major fines.\n\nDespite regulations, many Asian airliners continue to jettison the content their toilet tanks over the Pacific Ocean, and even over land.\n\nIn December 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) of India ordered a fine of Rs. 50,000 on airlines emptying toilet tanks in the air, after a Delhi neighborhood was repeatedly hit by blue ice.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/plane-accidentally-empties-toilet-tank-over-cruise-ship-23-injured/","1491921498.0"

"Bill Gates Admits “Vaccines Are Best Way To Depopulate”\nBill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world.\n\nGates says that in order to successfully depopulate an “overcrowded world” at least 350,000 must be killed each day, and he says this can be done via vaccine programs.\n\n[SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO]\n\nAnonymousmags.com reports:\n\nVaccines are one of the biggest public health victories in human history. People are exceedingly reliable to it for eradicating illness and reducing the incidence of new infections of diseases such as polio, diphtheria, measles, rubella, rotavirus and many others.\n\nHowever, despite this public health success, irrational anti-vaccine sentiments based on ignorance and fear mongering continues to exist. They do more harm than good. Vaccines and general improvements in health care availability increase the living standards of individuals.\n\n\n\nVaccination – to reduce population! (Bill Gates… by wslnow\n\nBill Gates expound on how we must all consent to a ‘kill the humans’ strategy, to ‘save the planet’ from the carbon dioxide we make. See his lips move. I’m not kidding.\n\nIt is not a new thing that some parents wouldn’t want their children to be vaccinated. They say that it is just wrong to inject their kids with a VIRUS—no matter what state it may be. They perceive it as making their children SICK. Physicians say otherwise as they believe that getting vaccinated will make one’s immune system ‘aware’ of viruses so that when it comes into contact with the body, our white blood cell ‘soldiers’ would know how to defend them. And for years, the doctors have been quite successful in convincing many people of this premise.\n\nBut now, a recent study puts to light a not-so-new problem with vaccines. And it is mainly because its adjuvant ‘Aluminum’ may be doing more harm than good.\n\nChemicals that are commonly used in the production of vaccines, according to the CDC, are done so to improve the effectiveness of the vaccine. Adjuvants like aluminum (one of the most common) are a component of vaccines that potentates the immune response to an antigen. The adjuvant is basically used to invoke the desired immune response.\n\nAluminum has been added to vaccines for approximately 90 years, and since then, a lot of controversy, especially in recent years, has emerged regarding their safety and effectiveness.\n\nThis controversy comes as a result of a number of recent studies (some of which are presented in this article) outlining clear concerns over the use of aluminum in this manner, as well as the fact that over the past few years, billions of dollars have been paid to families with vaccine injured children.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children.\n\nThis is quite concerning, given the fact that recommended immunization rates have more than doubled in the past few decades. In some developed countries, by the time a child is 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds, along with high amounts of aluminum adjuvants through routine vaccinations.\n\nHere are some eye-opening reasons why so many people are starting to question the safety of administering vaccines that contain aluminum.\n\nOur team works hard around the clock to bring you the best content on the web.

"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\nWomen retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a new study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\n\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.\n\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course. As it turns out, the female brain is even more mysterious than we previously thought.\n\nThe study found that female brains often harbor “male microchimerism“, or in other words, the presence of male DNA that originated from another individual, and are genetically distinct from the cells that make up the rest of the woman.\n\nAccording to the study: “63% of the females (37 of 59) tested harbored male microchimerism in the brain. Male microchimerism was present in multiple brain regions.”\n\nSo 63% of women carry male DNA cells that live in their brains. Obviously the researchers wanted to know where the male DNA came from.\n\nAnyone care to guess? From the women’s fathers? No. Your father’s DNA combines with your mother’s to create your unique DNA. So where else could it come from?\n\nThrough the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. That was the safe, politically correct assumption. But these researchers were living in denial.\n\nBecause when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain.\n\nAt this point the scientists didn’t know what the hell was going on. Confused, they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it. They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles, but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement, the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from.\n\nWhat are they so afraid of?\n\n“CONCLUSIONS: Male microchimerism was not infrequent in women without sons. Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion, vanished male twin, an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation, or SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. Male microchimerism was significantly more frequent and levels were higher in women with induced abortion than in women with other pregnancy histories. Further studies are needed to determine specific origins of male microchimerism in women.“\n\nSo according to the scientists, the possible sources of the male DNA cells living in the women’s brains are:\n\nan abortion the woman didn’t know about a male twin that vanished an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation sexual intercourse\n\nConsidering the fact that 63% of women have male DNA cells residing in the recesses of their brain, which of the above possibilities do you think is the most likely origin of the male DNA?\n\nThe first three options apply to a very small percentage of women. They couldn’t possibly account for the 63% figure. The fourth option? It’s rather more common.\n\nThe answer is 4. Sex.\n\nThis has very important ramifications for women. Every male you absorb spermatazoa from becomes a living part of you for life. The women autopsied in this study were elderly. Some had been carrying the living male DNA inside them for well over 50 years.\n\nSperm is alive. It is living cells. When it is injected into you it swims and swims until it crashes headlong into a wall, and then it attaches and burrows into your flesh. If it’s in your mouth it swims and climbs into your nasal passages, inner ear, and behind your eyes. Then it digs in. It enters your blood stream and collects in your brain and spine.\n\nLike something out of a scifi movie, it becomes a part of you and you can’t get rid of it.\n\nWe are only now beginning to understand the full power and ramifications of sexual intercourse.\n\nSources\n\nMale Microchimerism in the Human Female Brain\n\nMale microchimerism in women without sons: quantitative assessment and correlation with pregnancy history","http://yournewswire.com/women-dna-man-sex/","1498236586.0"
"Donald Trump’s “notepad” photo was taken at some woman’s desk at an auction house (updated)\nUpdate: Palm Beach Show Group is claiming that the desk in this story was located at Donald Trump’s home of Mar-a-Lago at the time the photograph occurred. However, this claim can not be taken at face value. Palm Beach Show Group and Donald Trump have long had a close personal and financial relationship.\n\nFor instance the CEO of Palm Beach Show Group, Scott Diament, is a paying member of Trump’s club where they both socialize (source: his Facebook page), meaning he paid at least six figures to Trump to become a member (source: CNBC). This means that Palm Beach Show Group must be viewed as a biased, financially entangled, and unreliable source when assessing the question of whether this photo was taken in a location that could be viewed as more embarrassing or less embarrassing to Trump; Palm Beach Show Group had every motivation to cover for Trump in this matter.\n\nWe thoroughly reject the subsequent faulty “fact check” from Snopes (link) which tries to make the definitive claim that the photo was taken at Mar-a-Lago, but bases its conclusion solely on taking the word of Trump’s close ally as if it were fact – a violation of basic rules of journalism when it comes to characterizing compromised sources. Palmer Report calls on Snopes to acknowledge the obviously faulty nature of its “fact check” and withdraw its unsubstantiated “False” rating. We stand by our original article.\n\n—–\n\nPalmer Report’s original article:\n\nYesterday we reported that Donald Trump nearly got himself laughed off the internet when he tweeted a staged photo of himself awkwardly clutching a cheap notepad while insisting that it was him writing his inaugural address at his Florida home. Today the jokes have gotten even better, because that wasn’t his home. Instead he inexplicably went to an auction house and kicked a receptionist out of her desk in order to take the staged photo of himself with the notepad.\n\nTrump posted this bizarre photo of himself while sitting in front of a gaudy golden wall with a distinctive design pattern:\n\nNumerous internet sleuths managed to hunt down this photo on Instagram from the Palm Beach Show Group, an auction house:\n\nThe auction house refers to it as the “Mar-a-Lago” desk which suggests it may have been in Trump’s possession at one time, or it may have previously been at his house. But both photos are taken in front of the same auction house wall. And this woman is clearly now using it as her desk. So Donald Trump really did go to an auction house and take over a woman’s desk and use it to take a photo of himself pretending to write his inauguration on a 99 cent notepad which he probably stole from her.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe speak for all Americans when we say that the real question here is why?\n\nSupport quality political journalism by making a contribution to Palmer Report: PayPal • GoFundMe\n\nWhen it comes to important political storylines, Palmer Report is consistently early and accurate – just ask our longtime readers.

This protein is also found in very high concentrations in autistic children. And they're PUTTING it in our vaccines!!\n\nThis prevents the body from utilizing the Vitamin D necessary to fight cancer and prevent autism. Nagalese disables the immune system. It's also known to cause Type 2 Diabetes.

"BREAKING: PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT PREVENTS ILLEGALS FROM USING WELFARE.

Illegals aren’t that fortunate. They will soon learn what’s like to live in a country ruled by Donald Trump. Every illegal who tries to collect a welfare check will feel justice on their back.\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order according to which any illegal who lives on welfare will be sent home. And that’s not all. America will no longer accept people who come here to live on our expense. These people will no longer be able to enter the country.\n\nFrom Conservative Daily Post:\n\n“The administration would be seeking to “deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge” and develop standards for “determining” whether an immigrant can be deported after five years, if that person receives a certain amount of public assistance, including Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid.”\n\nIt was about time that Americans take the matter in their own hands.

"JEFFERSON DAVIS STATUE TO BE REPLACED WITH OBAMA LIKENESS\nWorkers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.\n\nAs workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.\n\n“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.\n\nThe Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.\n\n“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”\n\nThe Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.\n\nLike an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.\n\nBeaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.\n\n“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”\n\nBefore the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away.

The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”\n\nAs Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders.","https://www.tdtalliance.com/jefferson-davis-statue-replaced-obama-likeness/","1494593432.0"

Ltd (16%), Toronto-based InstarAGF Asset Management Inc. (15%), and the City of Toronto (10%).\n\nThe Toronto Port Authority, the federal agency that currently owns and operates the airport, will be dissolved, and its portfolio over the airport’s lands and assets will become a purview of Canada Lands Company, which also owns and operates Downsview Park, the CN Tower, and the Old Port of Montreal.\n\n“We are incredibly excited about today’s announcement,” said Michael Rensie, the president and CEO of Hiawatha. “Disney theme parks are known throughout the world for extraordinary rides, shows, and unique experiences that are enjoyed by the entire family. We are proud to be a part of the growing family of Disney parks and resorts worldwide.”\n\nHiawatha’s contribution is $250 million from the federal and municipal partners and $2.88 billion cash from Oxford Properties, Kilmer Van Norstrand, and Instar AGF. The remainder of its share in the investment comes from the provided land value.\n\nDisney will provide $3.36 billion cash and have full creative control.\n\n“This partnership is a celebration of creativity, collaboration, commitment, and innovation, and a testament to Toronto’s growing place in the world,” Toronto Mayor John Tory said. “Disney’s choice of Toronto for the location of its next international theme park is certainly a vote of confidence in our city and our future by the world’s most prestigious and renowned entertainment company.”\n\n“Toronto Disney Resort will be an extraordinary destination that will provide Toronto with its largest year-round tourism engine and create self-funded improvements to Toronto Islands’ attractions and resilience to flooding,” continued Tory.\n\nUpon opening, Toronto Disneyland will have a capacity for up to 45,000 guests – just over half of Magic Kingdom and Disneyland Anaheim. Theme park operations will employ about 8,000 people, and an additional 3,500 people will be employed in other areas such as hotel and transportation operations.\n\nFollowing a four-year consultation and detailed design period, and subject to various final approvals, construction could begin in 2022 for an opening by summer 2028.\n\nPlanners estimate Toronto Disneyland will attract six million visitors in its first year of operations and grow to 12 million visitors per year after 20 years. Comparatively, Canada’s Wonderland already sees over 3.7 million visitors per year within its six-month-long seasonal operations period.\n\nToronto Disney Resort is expected to boost Toronto’s economy by $48.5 billion over the first 30 years, with 15,000 jobs created during the construction phase and generate a total of 40,000 direct and indirect jobs once open.\n\nWith airport operations at Billy Bishop ceasing to exist, there will be a greater focus on expanding Toronto Pearson International Airport as a mega regional hub.\n\nHere are the preliminary plans for Toronto Disney Resort:\n\nToronto Disneyland\n\nA media backgrounder on the scope of Toronto Disneyland, with preliminary conceptual renderings, show a new concept, all-season theme park that will be substantially different than the destinations in California and Florida.\n\nThe 350-acre theme park will occupy the 200-acre airport lands and require an additional 150 acres of infill to accommodate both the attractions, back-of-house facilities, hotels, public spaces, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe park will be designed with Toronto’s harsh winter climate in mind, while also taking advantage of it.\n\nLike other Disney parks, there will be daily parades and a nightly fireworks show.\n\nSome of the early concepts show an initial seven themed lands upon opening:\n\nMickey Avenue, Canada\n\nSimilar to Main Street, USA, and borrowing the concept of Shanghai Disneyland’s Mickey Avenue, this welcoming avenue – inspired by the colourful personalities of Mickey Mouse and his friends – with shops and restaurants will provide the first main entry into the theme park.\n\nFantasy Land\n\nA 16-storey castle with a unique design will be located at the heart of the park, within Fantasy Land. Expect familiar rides such as Peter Pan’s Flight over London, an indoor Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Little Mermaid’s Ariel Undersea Adventure, and the Hundred Acre Wood with Winnie the Pooh.\n\nFrozen Land\n\nOne of the lands will be based on the world of Frozen, including the Arendelle castle, rides and live shows based on the hit film, and uniquely themed dining and shopping.\n\nStar Wars: The Ice Planet\n\nA ‘mountain range’ with three mountains reaching 13-storeys high will provide the setting for the ice planets in the Star Wars universe. Expect giant replicas of the attacking imperial forces’ AT-ATs outside, and a cavernous indoor environment inside the mountain for the rebel base, with the Millennium Falcon doubling as a restaurant and various indoor rides such as Star Tours and a ‘dark roller coaster’.\n\nMarvel Universe\n\nExplore the base of The Avengers and the hidden, super-modern nation of Wakanda from Black Panther, with unique indoor rides, dining, and shopping.\n\nThe Gardens\n\nSimilar to Epcot, a 10-acre land will be exhibition space to host special seasonal events and festivities throughout the year.\n\nDuring the cold winter and early-spring months, it will feature one of the world’s largest ice and snow festivals. Imagine dozens of giant ice and snow sculptures of Star Wars characters, Mickey Mouse and his friends, and more, which all illuminate with colours at night.\n\nAs for the summer and early fall months, the gardens could be used for festivals celebrating flowers, food, and wine.\n\nFuture expansion\n\nApproximately 60 acres, accomplished through lake infill, will be reserved for the future addition of two or three lands.\n\nDisney takeover of Toronto Islands’ park space and attractions\n\nUnder the agreement, Disney will improve, manage, and operate Toronto Islands’ existing green spaces and attractions – a takeover of the responsibilities currently under the City of Toronto’s Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division.\n\nDisney is anticipated to invest $475 million towards improvements over a five-year timeline. This includes:\n\n$65 million for landscaping and other public realm improvements.\n\n$250 million for flood prevention and mitigation projects on the islands, including new perimeter flood dikes that blend in with the natural landscape, elevating vulnerable areas by up to two metres, and new water pumps. Toronto Islands will be able to withstand a 1 in 1,000-year flood event following these improvements.\n\n$50 million for new and improved outdoor recreational facilities, including $20 million to improve waterways and facilities for rowing, canoe, and kayak sports.\n\n$10 million for new pay-to-use recreational facilities and equipment, such as bike rentals, beach chairs,\n\nMost of Centreville Amusement Park will close for its conversion into a $100-million dining hub with five new restaurants and a live entertainment area. Only the vintage carousel, antique windmill ferris wheel, Far Enough Farm petting zoo, and the newly built aerial gondola will remain.\n\nOverall, after further phases of expansion with additional attractions, Toronto Islands could resemble a resort attraction model similar to Sentosa, a popular island resort next to downtown Singapore, with Universal Studios Singapore as one of the island’s anchor attractions.\n\nTwo Disney-themed hotels\n\nTwo hotels adjacent to the Disneyland park are proposed.\n\nThe upscale Toronto Disneyland Hotel on the eastern side of the airport property, next to the park’s exterior entrance and ticketing plaza, will have 350 rooms. The hotel will boast some of the best views of the downtown Toronto skyline.\n\nOn the western side of the theme park, immediately south of Hanlan’s Point Beach, will be Disney’s Port Toronto Hotel – a mid-scale, ship-themed hotel property with 700 rooms. The existing clothing optional beach area will be relocated to Ward’s Island Beach on the easternmost end of Toronto Islands.\n\nBoth hotels will have the Disney resort’s flagship restaurants.\n\nNew transportation links\n\nTo support the ingress and egress of large crowds and ‘cast members’ (the term Disney uses to describe its staff and employees) to Toronto Disneyland, the hotels, and other Toronto Disney Resort areas on Toronto Islands, there will be a multi-modal approach to improving transportation connections while maintaining a car-free environment on the islands.\n\nWestern Channel Bridges\n\nTwo bridges will be built over the Western Channel between the existing airport passenger pick-up and drop-off facility in downtown Toronto’s Bathurst neighbourhood and the islands, with one 50-metre wide bridge for pedestrians only and a second 15-metre wide bridge on the far western end for the movement of goods, supplies, and materials.\n\nThe pedestrian-only bridge will directly lead to the main entrance and ticketing plaza of Toronto Disneyland.\n\nTo support the crowds, this will also necessitate the closure of Eireann Quay Road south of Queens Quay West into a pedestrian-only road.\n\nDisney Transport\n\nDisney Transport, the Disney Parks & Resorts division that operates the public transit system at Walt Disney World in Florida, will takeover the operation of the Toronto Island ferries from the City of Toronto’s Parks, Forestry, and Recreation division.\n\nThis includes the acquisition of additional large vessels, particularly for the main route to Toronto Disneyland’s entrance and ticketing plaza, and other improvements to existing ferry terminals elsewhere on the islands.\n\nAdditionally, Disney Transport will take over the construction and operations of the new Jack Layton Ferry Terminal. There will be some modifications to the chosen 2016 terminal redesign to adjust to the needs of Disney’s anticipated crowd volumes.\n\nParkades\n\nWhile there will be an emphasis on public transportation services, including the Disney Transport ferries, several new multi-storey parking facilities will be constructed for Toronto Disney Resort guests:\n\n1,000 car parking lot at Stadium Road Lot at 12-34 Little Norway Crescent\n\nA new six-storey underground parking lot with 4,000 stalls at the current site of Little Norway Park, with new green spaces and playing fields built above the park.\n\nA new five-storey parking lot at Lot A (Gore Lot) of Exhibition Place with 6,000 stalls.\n\nCast member-only parking facilities will be built elsewhere at yet-to-be determined locations, with cast members shuttled to the pedestrian tunnel.\n\nAirport Pedestrian Tunnel\n\nBilly Bishop Toronto City Airport’s existing airport pedestrian tunnel will be re-purposed into a tunnel for the entrance and exit passage for cast members to use. This will ensure cast members arrive to their workplace out of sight in secret in order to maintain the Disney magic for guests.\n\nPotential future transportation\n\nFuture transportation connections include built-in provisions for a subway station near Toronto Disneyland’s main entrance and ticketing plaza, should a decision be made to extend the subway to Toronto Islands.\n\nOther options potentially even include a people mover rail line between Union Station and the main entrance via Bathurst.\n\nHanlan’s Point’s origins as an amusement park\n\nIf the Disney resort plan proceeds, it will represent a “full circle” journey for Toronto Islands’ use as a theme park/amusement park destination for the region.\n\n“There is no question Toronto Islands is returning to its roots as an amusement destination for our world-class city,” said Tory.\n\nHanlan’s Point, which is on the proposed footprint of Toronto Disneyland, was once the home of Hanlan’s Point Amusement Park. This amusement park operated from the 1880s to the 1920s with numerous rides and attractions such as a roller coaster, scenic railway, carousel, carnival games, a theatre, dance pavilion, and grandstand for larger live entertainment shows.\n\nThe Hanlan family also built a hotel on the western edge of the islands – right next to the amusement park at the approximate location of the existing nude beach, near the location of the proposed Disney’s Port Toronto Hotel.\n\nThen in 1910, Hanlan’s Point Stadium was constructed next to the amusement park. The 18,000-seat stadium was the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball club and is known as the home of Babe Ruth’s first professional home run.\n\nAn open house exhibition of the detailed preliminary plans, including additional renderings and models, for Toronto Disney Resort will be held at Metro Toronto Convention Centre between May 4 and 13 (10 am to 6 pm weekends; 2 pm to 8 pm weekdays).

"BREAKING: 7 Liberal ‘Heroes’ Arrested In Oscar Party Drug Raid\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 22.4k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nOscar night is Hollywood’s big chance to come together to celebrate each others’ achievements, strut around in a million dollars worth of gowns and tuxedos, show the world how elitists rule our society and then get together for a drug-filled night of partying and debauchery afterward. This year, on the orders of our president, Hollywood would pay for sticking its nose up at our laws, denigrating the good name of our president and protecting the illegal aliens and terrorists we all want gone.\n\nAccording to the White House OIP, President Trump directed the DEA and FBI to create a joint strike team to infiltrate the infamous drug-addled parties that notoriously follow the Oscars and to “make an example” of their hosts. The operation went off without a hitch, with the homes or privately-funded club parties of seven prominent liberals ending in shutdowns and arrests.\n\nAccording to Madeleine Shwiskler, Deputy White House Propagandist:\n\n“President Trump has attended some of these parties personally in the past and has often spoken of their heinous anti-government undertones and blatant drug use. These are exactly the kinds of events that the administration will be shutting down. Getting them on drug charges is much easier thatn prosecuting them for their crimes against the state.”\n\nThe celebrities arrested were booked outside the parties in mobile command centers and released so the fake news media wouldn’t have time to gather for photo ops or create their own narrative about what happened. As of this morning, nobody seems interested in reporting the event at all.\n\nArrested in the raid were Allison Janney, Bradley Cooper, Bette Midler, Seth Rogan, Drew Barrymore, Miley Cyrus and Justin Timberlake. They were all charged with providing safe haven for drug abuse, possession of various classes of substances, resisting arrest and inciting violence against the government. The drugs seized at the different parties included cocaine, molly, ecstasy, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine. Rogan’s party also had large quantities of powerful psychotropic drugs like LSD, MDMA and the ubiquitous brain chemical DMT.\n\nAll of the defendants are to appear in federal court and face fines of up to $100K and 2-20 years in prison if convicted. Surely their high-powered lawyers will find ways to keep them out of jail, but this should end those horrible Oscar parties where rich snobs get together to get high and trash talk our president.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-7-liberal-heroes-arrested-in-oscar-party-drug-raid/","1488198100.0"
"Pope Francis Forgives 4,444 Pedophile Priests In Australia\nAn inquiry in Sydney has uncovered evidence that Pope Francis has forgiven and covered up the crimes of 4,444 pedophile priests in Australia.\n\nThe Austrailian commission reported that not only were the priests forgiven by the Vatican for their crimes, allegations were “swept under the carpet” and never reported to law enforcement.\n\nFollowing years of mounting pressure to look into the claims of pedophilia, Canberra finally set up the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and the extent of the Catholic Church’s cover up was astonishing.\n\nDuring their investigation, the panel also discovered a pattern of witness intimidation and cover-ups. Gail Furness, the lawyer in charge of questioning at the Sydney inquiry, said in a statement:\n\n“Between 1950 and 2010, overall seven percent of priests were alleged perpetrators,”\n\n“The accounts were depressingly similar. Children were ignored or worse, punished. Allegations were not investigated. Priests and religious (figures) were moved.”\n\n“The parishes or communities to which they were moved knew nothing of their past. Documents were not kept or they were destroyed. Secrecy prevailed as did cover ups.”\n\nInquiry implicates Vatican finance chief\n\nDW reports: The claims of a cover-up go so high that they have implicated Australia’s top Catholic clergyman, George Pell.\n\nPell, who is now the Vatican finance chief, was questioned over his handling of abuse claims in the state of Victoria in the 1970s.\n\nCardinal Pell recently returned to Australia to face charges of child abuse and is the highest-ranking official in the Catholic Chruch to ever go on trial for pedophilia.\n\nThe inquiry found that about 90 percent of the 1,880 alleged perpetrators were men, and the victims averaged around age 10 for girls and 11 for boys.\n\n“These numbers are shocking, they are tragic, they are indefensible,” said Francis Sullivan, the head of the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council.\n\n“This data, along with all we have heard over the past four years, can only be interpreted for what it is: a massive failure on the part of the Catholic Church in Australia to protect children from abusers. “As Catholics, we hang our heads in shame.”\n\nOf the 300 cases referred to police throughout the course of the four-year investigation, only 27 prosecutions have been able to move forward, with 75 more pending.","http://yournewswire.com/pope-francis-pedophile-priests-australia/","1519751986.0"

"Information for the Nation\nHaven’t you noticed how cranky or irritable you are when you haven’t had a decent night’s sleep after a long time? Yes, sleep can brighten your mood and more. However, it doesn’t only do wonders for your emotional health—it also does great things for your overall well-being.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet are part of the process of getting to your ideal health, but it all starts with sleep. Here’s why you should change your opinion of sleeping as just resting a tired body.\n\nSleeping helps with Memory\n\nThose who lost a lot of time not sleeping in their childhood may suffer loss of memory in their old age. That’s because when we sleep, our minds become like computers; while we aren’t aware of it, it processes things we’ve done during the day when we awake. It’s how we master some things.\n\nSleep gives you ‘Immortality’\n\nWell, we do fall asleep when we die, but sleeping—or getting the required amount of sleep—helps us live longer. A study done on people between the ages of 50 and 80 revealed that six hours or more of sleep helps people live longer. Obviously, we also are more active and alert when we’ve gotten our required hours of sleep.\n\nSleep helps your Body heal\n\nWhen we get our required several hours sleeping, our body slows down and gets more rest. This also helps in curbing certain diseases. Problems with the heart, results like stroke, arthritis, and diabetes are only some of the possible problems the body faces when it lacks sleep over a long time.\n\nIdeally Creating Ideas\n\nWhen we get a good night’s rest, we become more alert. Our minds are more creative as well. Studies have pointed to sleep as an aid to repurposing your memories. Hence, when we get more sleep, we get more ideas as well, leading to more creativity in our activities.\n\n﻿\n\nWhen we get more sleep, we also get less cranky. This is better for all the people around us and for us, as we win more friends by sleeping—it’s like hitting two birds with one stone.","http://theseattletribune.com/idaho-mother-sentenced-prison-multiple-citations-public-breastfeeding/","None"
"John McCain Says He ‘Accidentally’ Voted No On Healthcare Repeal\nRepresentative John McCain stunned the whole nation by voting NO on the Obamacare annul on the Senate floor a few days ago, yet despite the fact that he made a flood of new fans from the left, he is currently saying he committed an error, and that his cerebrum tumor is to mind.\n\n“I quickly lost my faculties, and truly couldn’t recollect which route was up, and which was down,” said McCain, talking from his home, where specialists have put him on bedrest. “That is to say, obviously, to vote TO cancel it, similar to the arrangement. As I’ve specified some time recently. Nothing Republicans like accomplishing more than screwing the whole nation, thus normally I ought to have offered a go-ahead. I swear I did. This mind tumor is truly incurring significant damage.”\n\nSadly, the vote sticks as-seems to be, unless a greater part requires another vote at some point in the following 90 days.\n\n“I think at that vote, I may decline,” said McCain. “In case I’m as yet alive, I truly would prefer not to botch this up again, and you never know how my vote may go.”","https://web.archive.org/web/http://americannews88.com/2017/08/01/john-mccain-says-accidentally-voted-no-healthcare-repeal/","1501560000.0"
"Pence: “Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had”\nMike Pence said he didn’t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”\n\n“First and foremost,” Pence argued, “I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”\n\nThe governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”\n\nHe continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”\n\n“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”\n\n“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded.","http://politicono.com/pence-michelle-obama-vulgar-first-lady-weve-ever/","1476468568.0"
"Obama’s Burial Plot Is A Massive Waste Of Taxpayer Money (IMAGES)\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 2.8k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nWhen a president dies, the country pays for their burial. In the case of a president like JFK, who was a war hero and assassinated in the middle of a term, something extravagant is in order. His burial at Arlington with the memorial paid for by the people cost almost $4 million in today’s money, adjusted for inflation. The Kennedy family paid for the casket, vault and the eternal flame.\n\nRonald Reagan, one of the most influential men in history, is buried in California at his Presidential Library, paid for by donations from the people and the Reagan family. In fact, other than Kennedy, which we can all agree was warranted, no president has ever cost the taxpayers more than $100K in today’s money to bury.\n\nThe clause in the Presidential Contract enacted by congress in 1819 states that the president shall receive the burial service deemed fit for his stature and that the cost of the funeral and burial plot will be paid for by the people of a grateful nation. While every president who has died in modern history, except Reagan, took advantage of that perk of the presidency, none have gone so far that anyone would ever have noticed. Until now that is.\n\nBarack Obama has just submitted his plans for burial in a plot that will house his entire family, citing the Kennedys, the Tafts and the Roosevelts as precedent, inside a monument he had designed to celebrate the nation’s first black president. The monument, which will occupy space on the National Mall along with monuments to Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and hundreds of thousands of fallen heroes, will cost the taxpayers roughly $120 million and will be listed as a national historical place with 24 hour protection from the 3rd US Infantry Regiment, just like the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThe memorial would be built immediately upon approval and occupy the Northeast quadrant of the lawn near the Washington Monument with a view of the White House:\n\nThe monument itself would include quotes from his years as president along with a giant bronze statue and burial crypts for him and his family under a large arch:\n\nYou heard that right. Obama will be guarded around the clock in a monument among those of our founding fathers and greatest heroes, paid for by the taxpayer. It’s not too late to call your congressman and object. He should be in a cemetery in Chicago with the community he spent so much time “organizing,” not in a monument on our National Mall.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/obamas-burial-plot-is-a-massive-waste-of-taxpayer-money-images/","1492986381.0"
"Liberals Now Want To Abolish ‘Fathers Day’- Here’s What They Want It Changed To\nSassy Liberty AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –\n\nIt seems political correctness is not solely an American problem, that bug has bitten Australia too. Currently, in Australia there is a campaign that has been launched to rename “Father’s Day” and the idea appears to be gaining traction among certain groups.\n\nThe campaign is being spearheaded by a lady named Red Ruby Scarlet. Scarlet had a Ph. D in early childhood studies and she thinks that Father’s Day is highly unfair to children that have no father present in their life. As a result of this, Scarlet is proposing that the name of the holiday be changed to “Special Persons’ Day.”\n\nScarlet gave an interview with Adelaide’s “Today Tonight” television news show. During the interview, Scarlet was asked if “Special Persons’ Day” was just for children without dads, or if it was more inclusive than that.\n\nScarlet stated in response –\n\n“There are children who have a dad, who also have a grandfather, and also have an auntie and also have other kinds of relatives. There are also a huge range of different family structures. So we have single-parent families, satellite families, extended families, lesbian and gay families.”\n\nAccording to “Today Tonight” the idea is growing in support across the nation of Australia. In fact, this idea is even being implemented in some schools across the country. Scarlet denies that this is political correctness in any form, instead stating this is simply “fair.”\n\n“Why are we calling this political correctness when in fact it’s about our rights?”\n\nShe also claims there is a ton of research to back up her crazy talk and that this move should not in any way be deemed controversial.\n\n“There’s a lot of Australian research that has actually informed a lot of international research … that has demonstrated children’s capacity to be really inclusive, once they know about these ideas. And they think, ‘Wow, why are people seeing this as a controversy?’”\n\nWhat Scarlett does not seem to grasp is that her politically correct campaign of buffoonery that attempts to not “offend anyone” yet it will undoubtedly manage to offend a ton of families and fathers, step fathers, grandfathers, and father figures across Australia and rightly it should. Fathers matter a great deal in a child’s life in spite of the political correct crazies trying to diminish that.\n\nIt seems no campaign is in the works in any effort to rename “Mother’s Day,” however.

"Katy Perry: ‘Human Flesh Is The Best Meat; Cannibalism Got A Bad Rap’\nHuman flesh is the finest meat in the world, according to Katy Perry, who puts the “exquisite flavor” of the meat down to “the taboo nature of the product” and the fact that “forbidden pleasures are always the most delicious.”\n\nGoing as far as to claim that cannibalism is “way more popular than you might think”, Katy Perry also claimed that “so many people in Hollywood tell you that human meat is the best, the absolute best, meat in the world.”\n\nSpeaking on French radio, the Bon Appetit singer also claimed cannibalism has “gotten a bad rap” due to “squeamish Christians and their hypocritical virtues and morals”, but consuming the flesh of humans is actually “super healthy and good for you.”\n\n“There are life-enhancing vitamins and minerals in human flesh that you can’t get from animal meat,” Perry claimed.\n\nWhen asked which vitamins and minerals are available in human flesh, but not animal meat, the singer hesitated and then said,“I’m telling you, these people live way longer than the average, and their health is way better too, believe me,” Katy Perry said.\n\n“I’m telling you this because I thought you guys really appreciated good food, the best food. It’s in your culture. I thought you guys would understand. Eating human meat is not that shocking if you get over your bullshit bourgeouis moral code for a minute.”\n\nThe singer also described her first experience with cannibalism in Hollywood.\n\n“There is a group of old Hollywood guys who have an annual dinner party where the main dish is human. Every guest is allowed to bring a plus one. A few years ago, when I was new in town, I got invited by a good friend, I shouldn’t say his name I guess,” said Perry, who also explained that “each year a new host is selected for the following year by drawing straws, you know? It is the new host’s responsibility to provide the main course, and it has to be human. If he can’t find a suitable person to serve as the meal… Well the joke, I think it’s a joke, is that the host will be eaten instead!“\n\n“I was a bit squeamish about the idea of going to this dinner party, but when I heard who else was going I jumped at the chance. I was like, ‘People die all the time and their bodies just go to waste. If we can use their organs for medical purposes why shouldn’t we eat their meat?'”\n\nAsked what happened at the dinner party, Perry explained, “It was a huge, lavish feast. Oh my god. The featured dish was what they called Foie Humaine. You guys should appreciate that, being French. It’s a pun on foie gras, get it? But instead of force-feeding a duck and then eating it’s liver, this was the liver of a human who had force-fed themselves on junk food.”\n\n“A fatty liver fit for the kings of Hollywood.”\n\nDescribing herself as “not terribly fond of organ meats,” Perry passed on the liver dish, but did enjoy sampling human flesh during the multiple course Bacchanalian feast.\n\n“It tastes like pork,” the singer explained of human meat. “But a little bit bitter, stronger.”\n\nKaty Perry’s cannibalistic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the dark side. After starting her career as a Christian country singer, the she reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.\n\nSince establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Katy Perry has attempted to sugar coat her image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the French radio host suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.\n\nThe incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.","http://yournewswire.com/katy-perry-cannibalism/","1509560244.0"
"Tornado Carries Mobile Home 130 Miles, Family inside Unharmed\nWichita| A family from Tulsa, Oklahoma, underwent the scariest experience of their life yesterday, when their mobile home was carried over 130 miles by a tornado, landing in a rural Kansas area. Five members of the same family were inside the building during its “flight”, and all of them have miraculously survived without injuries.\n\n41-year old Dorothy Williams, was at home with her husband, her son, and her two brothers, when their mobile home was lifted off the ground by an F4 tornado.\n\nThe powerful winds reaching more than 220 miles per hour, carried and shook the mobile home for 4 hours and 18 minutes, sometimes at altitude of more than 1000 feet. After carrying the house across Northern Colorado and Southern Kansas, the tornado finally dropped it on a car, just outside of Wichita, 129.5 miles (208.5 kilometers) away from its point of origin.\n\nA few locals have witnessed the landing, like Michael Johnson, a 63-year old neighboring farmer, who describes an incredibly spectacular scene.\n\n“I saw something in the sky that looked like a plane without wings” says Mr. Johnson. “I seemed to be flying clumsily towards the ground, as if it was trying to land. It was probably 300 feet from me when I finally understood the it was a mobile home, and I freaked out. It landed directly on my neighbor’s car, which partially collapsed from the shock, but still rolled for almost 100 feet after the impact. It made an incredibly loud, crashing sound, and debris was flying everywhere. I thought I was going to die.”\n\nDespite the violence of the crash, with the house landing at a speed of more than 90 miles per hour, the incident did not cause any death or serious injury. All five occupants of the house have miraculously survived their incredible misadventure, suffering only a few scratches and bruises.\n\nThe family believes that their prayers were answered and that their survival is due to a divine intervention.\n\n“This was the scariest experience of my life,” says Dorothy Williams. “Our house was flying in the air, swinging and turning in each and every direction. The furniture was flying around and things were smashing against the walls. It felt like it was never going to end! All we could do was pray… so we kept praying. Then, suddenly, there was a very loud crashing sound, and it was all over. We had landed safely, and we were all alive. It was a real miracle! Jesus answered our prayers!”\n\nThis is not the first time that a house is lifted off the ground by a tornado and carried over some distance with its occupant inside, without them being killed. It is, however, the longest distance ever recorded for such a case, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nOn the evening of Thursday 12 June 2014, a house in Burnet County, Texas, about 16 km to the northeast of the city of Bertram, was lifted off its foundations by a tornado, The house was carried safely to a nearby pasture, with four members of the Ashworth family, plus their two dogs, unharmed.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/tornado-carries-mobile-home-130-miles-family-inside-unharmed/","1430241219.0"
"Is a doomsday asteroid on its way to Earth?\nLast year Nasa detected an object, that could be a comet or an asteroid, on a path towards Earth.\n\nThe space agency has said the mysterious object will safely pass Earth at a distance of nearly 32 million miles (51 million kilometres) on February 25th.\n\nBut one self-proclaimed astronomer has come up with an alternative theory, suggesting the asteroid will crash into Earth on February 16th and trigger a mega-tsunami, according to reports.\n\nLast year Nasa detected an object, that could be a comet or an asteroid, on a path towards Earth. One self-proclaimed astronomer has come up with an alternative theory, suggesting the asteroid will crash into Earth and trigger a mega-tsunami\n\nWHAT IS 2016 WF9? The recently-discovered object, called 2016 WF9, has been taking a scenic tour of our solar system, approaching Jupiter's orbit at its greatest distance from the sun. Over the course of 4.9 Earth-years, it has travelled inward, passing under the main asteroid belt and the orbit of Mars until it will swing just inside Earth's own orbit. The object, which is a blurred line between an asteroid and a comet, was discovered by Nasa's NEOWISE mission. 2016 WF9 is relatively large: roughly 0.3 to 0.6 miles (0.5 to 1 kilometre) across. It is quite dark, reflecting only a few per cent of the light that falls on its surface. Its body resembles a comet in its reflectivity and orbit, but appears to lack the characteristic dust and gas cloud that defines a comet.\n\nThe strange object, named 2016 WF9, was discovered last year.\n\nOver the course of 4.9 Earth-years, it has travelled inward, passing under the main asteroid belt and the orbit of Mars until it will swing just inside Earth's own orbit.\n\nThe object, which is a blurred line between an asteroid and a comet, was discovered by Nasa's NEOWISE mission.\n\nSelf-proclaimed Russian astronomer Dr Dyomin Damir Zakharovich said it is heading straight towards our planet.\n\n'The object they call WF9 left the Nibiru system in October when Nibiru began spinning counter clockwise around the sun,' he said.\n\n'Since then, Nasa has known it will hit Earth. But they are only telling people now.'\n\nIf the asteroid hit Earth, he says, it could destroy cities or cause a tsunami. 'We are all in peril.'\n\nNasa does not think the object will hit Earth, instead it is saying it will pass nearly 32 million miles (51 million kilometres) away from the planet.\n\n'The trajectory of 2016 WF9 is well understood, and the object is not a threat to Earth for the foreseeable future,' says Nasa.\n\nWhat scientists do know is that 2016 WF9 is relatively large: roughly 0.3 to 0.6 miles (0.5 to 1 kilometre) across.\n\nIt is quite dark, reflecting only a few per cent of the light that falls on its surface.\n\nConspiracy theorists believe the planet Nibiru is set to hit into our planet in October this year, after being driven here by the gravitational pull from a 'binary star' twinned with the sun - of which there is no evidence.

Nibiru is a different planet to the Planet Nine, which is also sometimes referred to as Planet X, that was proposed by astronomers in Caltech in January last year. Conspiracy theorists believe the gravitational influence of the 'rogue planet' Nibiru disrupted the orbits of other planets hundreds of years ago. They claim the next disruptive passage into the inner solar system could happen at any time. Some claims that this 'planet' is sending 'plasmatic energy particles' through our solar system. The flow of energy will disrupt the 'core flows' of the Earth and trigger catastrophic changes in Earth's climate. They claim, since 1996, we have already been feeling the disruptive effects of the inbound rogue Planet X. Conspiracy theorists often blame natural disasters and freak weather patterns on the planet. 'Nibiru and other stories about wayward planets are an internet hoax,' Nasa has said. 'Obviously, it does not exist.'\n\nIts body resembles a comet in its reflectivity and orbit, but appears to lack the characteristic dust and gas cloud that defines a comet.\n\n'2016 WF9 could have cometary origins,' said Deputy Principal Investigator James 'Gerbs' Bauer at JPL.\n\nBut, according to reports, Dr Zakharovich has said his 'data' reveals a different background.\n\nHe claims the comet or asteroid originated from the fictional planet Nibiru.\n\n'The object they call WF9 left the Nibiru system in October when Nibiru began spinning counter clockwise around the sun,' he said.\n\nConspiracy theorists believe the planet Nibiru is set to hit into our planet in October this year, after being driven here by the gravitational pull from a 'binary star' twinned with the sun - of which there is no evidence.\n\nNibiru, sometimes referred to as Planet X, is a hypothesised planet on the edge of our solar system.\n\n'Nibiru and other stories about wayward planets are an internet hoax,' Nasa has said.

"Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The Doctor\nMichelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.\n\nMany have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.\n\nMichelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.\n\nBiz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:\n\nWhy is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?\n\nDr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”\n\nWright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.\n\n“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”\n\nAs First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.\n\n“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.\n\nOf her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.\n\nThe best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.\n\nDean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:\n\nSo, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.\n\nHey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.\n\nThe truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.","https://www.nyfoxnews.co/michelle-obama-just-received-life-shattering-news-from-the-doctor/","1520203553.0"
"Clinton Email: We Must Destroy Syria For Israel\nA leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.\n\nThe new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the “best way to help Israel”.\n\nNewobserveronline.com reports:\n\nThe document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton’s private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.\n\nAlthough the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.\n\nThe email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government—and specifically to do this because it is in Israel’s interests.\n\n“The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,” Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.\n\nEven though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran’s “atom bomb” program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to “justify” destroying Syria in the name of Israel.\n\nShe specifically links Iran’s mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran’s “atom bomb” program threatens Israel’s “monopoly” on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.\n\nIf Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other “adversaries of Israel” such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to “go nuclear as well,” all of which would threaten Israel’s interests.\n\nTherefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.\n\nIran’s nuclear program and Syria’s civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about — but cannot talk about — is losing their nuclear monopoly.\n\nAn Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.\n\nIf Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.\n\nIt is, Clinton continues, the “strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria” that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel’s security.\n\nThis would not come about through a “direct attack,” Clinton admits, because “in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel” this has never occurred, but through its alleged “proxies.”\n\nThe end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel’s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.\n\nBringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel’s security, it would also ease Israel’s understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.\n\nThen, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.\n\nClinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad “and his family” with violence is the “right thing” to do:\n\nIn short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.\n\nWith his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s mind.\n\nThe email proves—as if any more proof was needed—that the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to “protect” Israel.\n\nIt is also a sobering thought to consider that the “refugee” crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria.\n\nIn addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq—all thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the “rebels” and stoking the fires of war in Syria.\n\nThe real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton—whose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people—could become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all.\n\nClinton’s public assertion that, if elected president, she would “take the relationship with Israel to the next level,” would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth.","http://yournewswire.com/clinton-email-we-must-destroy-syria-for-israel/","1491561105.0"

"Flight MH370 Found With Eerie Black Box Recording: “SOS, They Are Not Human”\nImages have emerged of the wreckage of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, just hours after a Black Box recording surfaced featuring an eerie message.\n\nGoogle Earth pictures show the outline of the plane covered in bullet holes under the sea just north of Mauritius.\n\nThe discovery comes just hours after a Twitter user received a coded voicemail which experts claim to be a recording from inside the plane.\n\nThe message was in military codesign, which translates to: “Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human sos danger SOS.” The eerie voicemail also gave a series of numbers.\n\nUsers started doing their investigations on the meaning behind the “series of numbers.” The numbers when used as coordinates, pointed to a location near Malaysia. Digging deeper, it revealed that it was within the area in the radar where flight MH370 was last seen.\n\nAlso @ErMahoney6 pointed out that the coordinates given are very close to where the Malaysian airplane went down, what if you’re hearing the black box recording???!?????? pic.twitter.com/iKwN8F9bPG — Uzumaki (@jvstinfox) March 15, 2018\n\nThe Sun reports: Australian amateur crash investigator Peter McMahon has spent years poring over NASA and Google Maps images since the plane disappeared in the Indian Ocean four years ago and claims he now thinks he has found it.\n\nHe believes the aircraft is 10 miles south of small islet Round Island – an area not included in the search operation by experts.\n\nMr McMahon said he sent his findings to the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau, which confirmed it could be the missing craft.\n\nBut he claims they were then told by US officials to stick to the assigned area of the Indian Ocean.\n\nCould this be part of the front cabin of missing MH370 in waters south of Rodrigues Island?Mr McMahon, 64, told Daily Star Online: “Four Americans were sent to Australia to oversee the findings of MH370.\n\n“They have made sure that all information received has been hidden from the public, even our government – but why?”\n\nHe said authorities “do not want it found as it’s full of bullet holes, finding it will only open another inquiry.”\n\nAccording to reports, along with the main section, Mr McMahon claims to have found part of the front cabin in waters south of Rodrigues Island, also near Mauritius.\n\nMr McMahon, a mechanical engineer, as spent 25 years working on crash investigations.\n\nSearch teams have never found the bodies of the missing passengers and crew.\n\nEarlier this year Malaysia’s government approved US-company Ocean Infinity to dispatch a vessel to search more than 9.000 sq m of Australian waters for the missing Boeing 777.\n\nIts exact location has never been known.\n\nDebris was found by volunteers clearing a beach in St Andre, Reunion in 2015 and Australia released satellite imagery in 2017 showing 12 objects floating near the suspected crash site.","http://yournewswire.com/flight-mh370-black-box-sos/","1521411831.0"
"Trucks Full Of Illegals Caught Casting Fake Votes In Pennsylvania\nThe race for Pennsylvania’s 18th district was a close one, with Conor Lamb being declared the victor before write-in and absentee ballots had even been counted. The fact that Lamb “won” even in deep red areas that support President Trump overwhelmingly, is suspicious on its own — but reports of voter fraud make things even more peculiar (especially the trucks full of illegals).\n\nNot only did Fox News report that verified instances of voter fraud are already popping up in the state, but Breitbart uncovered another very serious problem:\n\nLocals captured photographs of what appears to be multiple trucks full of illegals at not one, not two, not even three, but six polling locations across Pennsylvania. All of the locations were in areas Trump dominated in the 2016 election.\n\nHere are some of the photos that were captured:\n\nDuring the presidential election, a similar incident made headlines when a “van full of illegals” was busted driving from polling location to polling location voting for Hillary Clinton. A total of twelve illegal aliens were arrested and deported. One American citizen traveling with them was a former Clinton campaign employee.\n\nSo far, police have no leads on this incident, but they are “investigating thoroughly” according to Pennsylvania State Police Officer Christian Blair.\n\nThe Democrat Party is scared of us.

"Nancy Pelosi In Critical Condition After Head-On Car Crash\nDemocrat Senator Nancy Pelosi was involved in a car crash yesterday in her home state of California after a town hall event where she once again accused Donald Trump of “colluding with Russia.”\n\nAccording to the West Los Angeles Police Department, wine was served at the event and Pelosi…well, she’s Nancy Pelosi so she drank a ridiculous amount of it.\n\nSgt.

"Corps’ top leaders warn Marines to stop eating Tide Pods — Duffel Blog\n20.1k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nWASHINGTON — The Marine Corps’ top leaders have warned junior troops to stop eating Tide Pods after a number of Marines have been hospitalized due to poisoning, sources confirmed today.\n\n“I don’t care what you guys do. Hell, you can even go back to drunken driving. Just stop eating laundry detergent, for Christ’s sake,” said Gen. Robert Neller, the Marine Commandant.\n\nTop officials have expressed concern in recent days over a number of incidents involving enlisted troops taking part in the “Tide Pod Challenge,” a viral internet campaign that challenges people to put laundry detergent in their mouth in order to raise awareness for Charles Darwin.\n\nAlthough health experts have issued various statements explaining the challenge could be deadly, a number of Marines have taken this as a challenge in itself to prove their battlefield prowess.\n\n“Nobody is going to tell me I can’t eat Tide Pods if I want to,” said Lance Cpl. Evan Miller from his hospital bed. According to barracks sources, over the weekend Miller attempted to eat three pods at the same time before chasing it with his favorite Burnt Sienna-flavored crayon.\n\nSo far, the number of Marines hospitalized due to poisoning from the challenge has been less than 100, though defense officials fear that number will rise as more Marines pass on troublesome rumors that they can eat Tide Pods to give them more energy on hikes or give them a boost in upper body strength.\n\n“Let’s just pray that no one starts a rumor that the Spartans ate Tide Pods before battle,” Neller said. “Then I’ll have tell the president my entire service branch is combat ineffective.”","https://www.duffelblog.com/2018/01/corps-top-leaders-warn-marines-stop-eating-tide-pods/","1516273258.0"
"California Senate Votes 28-8 to EXEMPT ITSELF From All California Gun Laws\nJFA | The California State Senate agrees with Charlie Rangel that they “deserve” to own guns but the citizens do not! Every year they pass more and more gun control laws and NONE of them apply to themselves!\n\nThey voted 28-8 to exempt themselves from the gun-control laws that apply to the rest of the California.\n\nYou think maybe this will cause Californians to rise up? NOPE! It happened 5 years ago and since then, California has passed a plethora of other gun laws…that only apply to citizens.\n\nYes, you heard me right! The exemption was created in 2011 and the California legislature has passed a number of gun laws since. Pretty easy when you are passing bills that do not apply to you!\n\nIt is not the only special privileges California legislators provide themselves!\n\nThey do not pay red light camera bills or for gasoline!\n\nHow does it all happen so easily in California? The Washington Post explains:\n\nAttempts by a handful of reformers to require politicians to provide a full annual disclosure of the benefits received from the public treasury have been rebuffed. Currently, government officials must file a statement of economic interests revealing income from any source other than a local, state or federal government agency. Gifts worth more than $50 also must be disclosed, but lawmakers rejected a bill that would have prohibited acceptance of concert and sporting event tickets, gift cards, spa treatments, golf outings and other benefits from lobbyists trying to buy votes.\n\nBills of this nature never meet an honest fate in which roll-call votes put members on the record as favoring or opposing each idea. Instead, reform measures are held in committee to die quietly as legislative deadlines pass. As of last week, it’s effectively impossible for a bill to become law if it hasn’t already passed in at least one of the chambers.\n\n…and it just goes on and on!\n\nRed Skelton said so eloquently in his commentary on the Pledge of Allegiance:\n\nAnd to the Republic — A Republic: a sovereign state in which power is invested into the representatives chosen by the people to govern; and the government is the people; and it’s from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the people.\n\nCalifornia has it backwards, they are running with the method of “from the leaders to the people.”\n\nThat is why I joined the 5 million people who have fled California within the last decade.\n\nYou can take me out of Texas in a pine box, and even then I will be kicking and screaming!","http://theviralpatriots.com/california-senate-votes-28-8-exempt-california-gun-laws/","1510517741.0"
"7-year old girl receives breast implants for Christmas\nJuliet Manson, from Glendale in California, received a very special present from her mother for Christmas: a trip to China to undergo a breast augmentation surgery.\n\nThe 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years, insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery.\n\nHer mother, Dana Manson, says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time, but her daughter was “completely obsessed” with the idea of getting breast implants.\n\n“She would ask us multiple times a day, every day,” she told NBC. “There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than having boobs.”\n\nMs. Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter, hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result, however, was very different from what she expected.\n\nAfter a dozen sessions with the young girl, the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem, and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial.\n\nFollowing the psychiatrist’s advice, Ms. Manson contacted dozens of clinics in the United States and Mexico, but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl.\n\nShe finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China, where doctors were willing to perform the operation.\n\nDana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present.\n\nThey left for China on December 22, and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic, the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned.\n\nThe young girl now has a 30C cup, and her mother says she’s “extremely happy about her about her new breasts”.\n\nThe young girl’s story caught the world’s attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery, instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media.\n\nMany people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age, while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation.\n\nDespite the critics, Dana Manson says she did “what was best for her daughter” and insists that she has no regrets.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/7-year-old-girl-receives-breast-implants-for-christmas/","1483041178.0"
"Scientists seek clues to what triggered past Yellowstone 'supervolcano' eruptions\nCLOSE Beneath the ground of Yellowstone National Park, lies a monster volcano that had its last 'super eruption' more than 630,000 years ago. It could erupt again. Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). Buzz60\n\nWyoming: Yellowstone National Park is a natural bucket list destination when you visit Wyoming, and there are places in the park you won't want to miss. Old Faithful Geyser will be on your itinerary, but you'll want to see Grand Prismatic Spring, too. The geyser has a bright blue center with rings of color in reds and green circling outward. The show is due to a combination of pigmented heat-loving bacteria and light reflection. It's also the third largest geyser in the world: It's wider than a football field and is deep enough to swallow a 10-story building. Take a trip up to Isa Lake while you're there. Perched astride the Continental Divide, the mountain lake drains into both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. (Photo: lorcel, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the findings of the recent research. The story has been updated and expanded.\n\nUnderneath Yellowstone National Park lies a 'supervolcano,' one that blows its top with a massive supereruption every few hundred thousand years.\n\nThe most recent 'supereruption' struck about 630,000 years ago, shaking the region and creating the Yellowstone caldera, a bowl 40 miles wide that forms much of the park. There have been several smaller eruptions since then.\n\nNow scientists are looking for clues about what triggered that eruption, and whether those signals could be used to detect possible future supereruptions.\n\nResearchers discovered that the forces that drive these supereruptions can occur much more rapidly than volcanologists previously anticipated: in the span of decades, not millenniums.\n\nChristy Till, an Arizona State University geologist, graduate student Hannah Shamloo, and other researchers from Arizona State analyzed minerals in fossilized ash from that most recent supereruption. They presented their research at a recent volcanology conference, but it has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\n\n“We expected that there might be processes happening over thousands of years preceding the eruption,” Till told The Times. Instead, the crystals revealed an increase in temperature and a change in composition that had happened more quickly.\n\nThere is no indication, however, that such an eruption is imminent, or that the volcano is 'due' for an eruption. 'The probability of such a large eruption occurring in any given year is 1 in 730,000,' Till said.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Shamloo analyzed crystals that recorded changes in temperature, pressure and water content beneath the volcano — much like a set of tree rings gives clues to past climates.\n\n“It’s shocking how little time is required to take a volcanic system from being quiet and sitting there to the edge of an eruption,” Shamloo told The Times, cautioning that more research is necessary before definite conclusions can be drawn.\n\nFortunately, even if there was a 'supereruption,' the effects would likely not be catastrophic.\n\nAs for the worst-case scenario, even previous Yellowstone supereruptions did not cause extinctions, and ash fallout on the other side of the continent was minimal, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThere is no way a volcanic eruption could end all life on Earth, Till said.\n\nIn fact, the Yellowstone supervolcano has erupted at least 23 times since the last 'supereruption.' All of those have been rather small lava flows. So if it did erupt, it would likely be one of those small eruptions, Till said.\n\nMore: A dozen ways life on Earth could end\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ys2YEx","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/10/12/yellowstone-supervolcano-may-blow-sooner-than-thought-could-wipe-out-life-planet/757337001/","1507780800.0"

"Los Alamos Study Finds Airport Scanners Can Rip Apart & Alter DNA – Collective Evolution\nCan we ever believe what our government tells us about airport security devices?\n\nApparently not. First they told us those X-ray scanners (that showed way too many naked body parts) were perfectly safe.\n\nEven the manufacturer of the device, Rapidscan, openly admitted the scanners had not been adequately tested. The truth was later revealed that the safety tests turned out to be totally rigged, as reported by Natural News.\n\nWith fabricated results, the technology was quickly rushed into every airport worldwide. No one listened to what the scientists in the field of radiation were trying to tell them – it’s not safe.\n\nIt wasn’t until the backscatter radiation levels the scanners were putting off began showing an increased incidence of cancer in TSA agents (along with the lawsuits that quickly followed), that the devices were finally yanked. The TSA quickly scrambled for another solution.\n\nNow they also want us to believe that the replacement technology, millimeter wave “digital strip search” scanners, are also “perfectly safe”.\n\nDon’t believe it for a second. The TSA failed to adequately test these devices for health and safety factors as well. Unfortunately, in today’s world, security trumps human safety.\n\nThese millimeter wave technologies are designed to bombard innocent travelers with high frequency energy particles known as terahertz photons.\n\nA study conducted by Boian S. Alexandrov et.al. at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, revealed that these terahertz waves could “…unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.”\n\nIn other words, this study is the smoking gun that raises serious concerns about the impact of terahertz radiation upon fertility, fetal development, and cancer.\n\nNow think about the thousands of people who are subjected to these levels of untested energy particles every day in the name of “National Security”.\n\nThe military’s Active Denial weapon uses millimeter wave technology to create an intense burning sensation on the skin’s surface using a 95 GHz (3.2mm wavelength) beam.\n\nBut the TSA tells us not to worry about their millimeter waves because:\n\n“Millimeter wave technology bounces harmless electromagnetic waves off the body to create the same generic image for all passengers.”\n\nKeep Evolving Your Consciousness Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox.\n\nThis is completely inaccurate because the nature of millimeter waves is that our bodies and water are excellent absorbers of these waves. Millimeter waves do penetrate and absorb into our skin.\n\nAt the microwave technology center in Malaysia, health subjects were exposed to microwave radiation between 20 — 38 GHz, the range in which the TSA scanners operate.\n\nThey found that millimeter waves penetrated the subject’s skin at depths of between 1.05 mm at 20 GHz to 0.78 mm at 38 GHz. This is enough to penetrate below the epidermal layer of the skin.\n\nMillimeter waves have been reported to produce a variety of bioeffects, many of which are quite unexpected from radiation penetrated less than 1 mm into biological tissues.\n\nOf particular concern is the citing of studies that show there is an irreversible water memory effect by millimeter waves operating in the 36GHz frequency, and that the millimeter wave effects on blood plasma vary greatly from one person to the next.\n\nDoes this information make you extremely uncomfortable? Well, it should. And it should also make every one of us mad as hell.\n\nSince the day they first rolled out these human violation technologies in 2007, I have always chosen to “opt out”. I would rather endure the intrusive body pat down any day than subject myself to covert DNA alteration.\n\nSo what if it takes an additional 5-15 minutes of your time getting to your gate? It’s time to exercise your own personal body health consciousness, since the US government has clearly demonstrated they don’t possess any qualms about not protecting you.\n\nAlternation of DNA can be subtle and deadly down the line. Who would ever make the connection that a TSA scanning machine might have contributed to any negative health effects you eventually experience.\n\nIf you are a frequent air traveler, like myself, you should be concerned about your levels of exposure. If you’re a TSA agent, you should find another job.\n\nThis past weekend as I was trying to make a flight back to Los Angeles from the Columbia, South Carolina Airport, I did my usual “opt out” thing. The TSA agents from this little backwater airport tried to feed me the propaganda line about “minimal risk.”\n\nI told them I’d read the studies and they needed to be better informed. They looked at me blankly trying to tell me it was just like using a cell phone. Not true.\n\nThe millimeter wave scanners the TSA operates put out more than 20 billion times more oscillations per second in smaller terahertz waves, so the cellular effects will be different from cell phones.\n\nI’m sure no one ever told TSA agents this, but they feed the same lies back to the people that they’ve been told, so I tried to be more forgiving.\n\nI’m sure no one had requested an opt out for some time in this South Carolina airport, which is why I got the pat down of all pat downs.\n\nThe female agent made sure to give me karate chops straight up to my private parts twice in the back and then another two times in the front. Totally unnecessary. She kneaded my waist in a strange manner, grabbing hold of any loose skin she could find.\n\nI have had hundreds of pat downs over the years, and no one, I mean no one, has ever been as intrusive as this TSA agent.\n\nMy first instinct was to tell her how inappropriate she was being, then I remembered how I would most likely be punished for my non-sheep-like behavior and not be allowed to make my flight.\n\nDuring the procedure she also sniffled and sneezed, spreading her germ warfare all over me through out the entire security grope session.\n\nI think we have all had enough of this undignified treatment in the name of security. It’s already been proven that these scanner devices and intrusive pat downs have not made our world any safer from terrorists.\n\nAirport security testers have snuck through everything from guns to explosives, clearly proving their ineffectiveness. Metal detectors should be sufficient enough.\n\nIf everyone opted out of the scanner, the whole program would eventually fall apart. The lines of opt outs would be so long it would bring the air travel industry to a standstill.\n\nIt would also send a clear message that unsafe devices are not going to be tolerated. Take the extra time and just do it — opt out. If you love yourself, than you owe it to yourself.\n\nNow I’m already ahead of you on what you’re thinking — that they’ll just suspend all our civil liberties and make it mandatory to go through the scanners whether we want to or not.\n\nWell, I would like to believe that they would be flooded with lawsuits if they did, but there’s an even easier solution. Go to a medical supply store and buy a cheap inexpensive arm sling and put it on before going through TSA.\n\nIf you can’t hold both arms up over your head while in their scanner, it renders the results totally unusable. They know this and have to let you opt out for medical reasons. The sheeple are getting smarter. Afterall, life is all about how you handle Plan B.\n\nDr. Kathy Forti is a clinical psychologist, inventor of the Trinfinity8 technology, and author of the book, Fractals of God.","http://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/02/19/los-alamos-study-finds-airport-scanners-can-rip-apart-alter-dna/","1487480400.0"
"NYC: PHYSICIAN and Wife Jump To Death…Leave Kids Behind Because They “Can’t Afford The Health Care” Only Hours After McCain, Murkowski, Collins and EVERY Democrat Voted To Keep Obamacare -\nNYC: PHYSICIAN and Wife Jump To Death…Leave Kids Behind Because They “Can’t Afford The Health Care” Only Hours After McCain, Murkowski, Collins and EVERY Democrat Voted To Keep Obamacare\n\nHealth Care. One sentence in a NYC couple’s suicide note tells the story of how so many Americans are feeling about health care these days. With premiums skyrocketing, it’s difficult to pay for healthcare even if you don’t have “medical issues” like this couple did. This is tragic and is symbolic of the desperation so many people are feeling right now.\n\nA Manhattan couple committed suicide just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare.\n\nBut three members of their own party – including Sen. John McCain – voted against the bill and it failed to pass, keeping the Affordable Care Act in place for now.\n\nThe couple jumped out of a window of a New York City office building together in desperation over their inability to afford their health care: ‘We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.’\n\nThe incident happened early Friday morning on the corner of Madison Avenue and 33rd Street – just a block from the Empire State Building.\n\nA 53-year-old chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife jumped out of a window of their recently-closed ninth-floor office in the 17-story building.\n\nTheir bodies were covered with white sheets once police arrived at the scene, shutting down the entire block to investigate.\n\nThe couple left behind suicide notes in a ziploc bag, that also included their IDs. Police have not released their names yet, but a photo obtained by the New York Post shows part of the letter, and it identifies the woman as Patricia. The note was titled ‘We had a wonderful life’. A law enforcement source who spoke with the Post said the woman’s note said: ‘Our kids are upstairs, please take care of them’.\n\n\n\nThe man left one behind too, which read: ‘We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.’\n\nThe building that the couple jumped from includes offices for law and advertising firms, therapists offices and commercial space.\n\nNo further information on the couple has been released.

"Tidalgate: Climate Alarmists Caught Faking Sea Level Rise\nAlarmist scientists have been caught red-handed tampering with raw data in order to exaggerate sea level rise.\n\nThe raw (unadjusted) data from three Indian Ocean gauges – Aden, Karachi and Mumbai – showed that local sea level trends in the last 140 years had been very gently rising, neutral or negative (ie sea levels had fallen).\n\nBut after the evidence had been adjusted by tidal records gatekeepers at the global databank Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) it suddenly showed a sharp and dramatic rise.\n\nThe whistle was blown by two Australian scientists Dr. Albert Parker and Dr. Clifford Ollier in a paper for Earth Systems and Environment.\n\nThe paper – Is the Sea Level Stable at Aden, Yemen? – examines the discrepancies between raw and adjusted sea level data in Aden, Karachi and Mumbai.\n\nKenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone reports:\n\nThe authors expose how PSMSL data-adjusters make it appear that stable sea levels can be rendered to look like they are nonetheless rising at an accelerated pace. The data-adjusters take misaligned and incomplete sea level data from tide gauges that show no sea level rise (or even a falling trend). Then, they subjectively and arbitrarily cobble them together, or realign them. In each case assessed, PSMSL data-adjusters lower the earlier misaligned rates and raise the more recent measurements. By doing so, they concoct a new linearly-rising trend.\n\nHere is a before/after from Karachi:\n\nThe authors do not mince their words. They refer to these adjustments as “highly questionable” and “suspicious.”\n\nThat’s because they can find no plausible scientific explanation for the adjustments.\n\nAs they explain at the beginning of their paper, it is hard to put together consistent sea level records covering a long time period. This is because tide gauges are often the result of multiple sets of data, taken over different time periods using different instruments, which are then spliced together.\n\nWhat is proposed as a single record in databases such as the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (PSMSL 2017a) is often the composition of data collected by different instruments, sometimes in different locations or over different time windows, with significant gaps in between one measurement and the others. This is the case of the Aden, Yemen tide gauge that is the only tidal location of the Arabian Peninsula spanning a time window long enough to infer a trend and acceleration of the relative sea level (assuming there was continuous measurement and no quality issue). In Aden, similar to Karachi and Mumbai and other tide gauges of the area, a single-tide gauge record is the result of multiple sets of data subjectively coupled together. While a new tide gauge is recording since about 2007, the alignment of the previous data is continuously changing.\n\nSo there is nothing per se wrong with PSMSL making adjustments in order to make the different datasets align.\n\nWhat is wrong is the way that the scientists at PSMSL have adjusted them. In every case, they have revised them in order to make them produce a sharp upward trend in sea level rise – despite the fact that global records do not support this.\n\nThe truth, Parker and Ollier conclude in their paper, is that sea level has changed very little in the three sites examined:","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/12/06/tidalgate-climate-alarmists-caught-faking-sea-level-rise/","1512536400.0"
"UPDATE: Ivanka Trump’s Condition Downgraded to Critical\nIvanka Trump, who was originally listed in stable condition at Bethesda, is now listed as critical. Doctor Harvey Basheer told Fox News:\n\n“We can’t even officially say she’s here, but it won’t be a secret for long. Ivanka Trump was brought in with a single gunshot wound to the left shoulder. On further axamination, shrapnel from the shot shattered her clavicle, leaving the possibility for sharp shards of bone to pierce the heart, which is almost always fatal. We have Ms. Trump in surgery now to remove the bone fragmwent we can see, but the next 24 hours will be crucial.”\n\nFox has removed the ticker reporting for this incident as the hospital pulled the plug. We’ve been told by AP and Reuters that confirmation on this story is currently being held up by the White House OIP for national security purposes.\n\nWhat we have pieced together is that Ivanka Trump was wounded earlier at a party in Washington; the apparent victim of a sniper on a rooftop nearly 700 yards away. That sniper is in custody after a very perceptive young beat cop watched the muzzle flash happen in real time and had the building surrounded when the shooter came down.\n\nThe White House has no plans to discuss or confirm this matter sooner than tomorrow morning, if at all.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://reaganwasright.com/2018/01/05/update-ivanka-trumps-condition-downgraded-to-critical/","1515128400.0"
"President Trump Just Made Trey Gowdy The Most Powerful Man In Capitol Hill\n1.4k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nThe three Congressmen Gaetz, Gowdy and Goodlatte have joined their powers to request an appointment of a special counsel to look into the FISA warrant abuses that took part during former president Obama’s time in office.\n\nGaetz even reportedly said that the Obama State Department was an arm of Hillary Clinton’s failed Presidential Campaign.\n\nThe Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz appeared on “Rose Unplugged,” where he talked about the information that would have been uncovered if a special counsel was appointed to the FISA issue.\n\nGaetz pointed out that there would be even more discoveries regarding Obama’s State Department, and the way they operated against people who they viewed as threats to the Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to a report from the Fox News: “House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Rep. Trey Gowdy on Tuesday demanded the appointment of a special counsel to investigate “conflicts of interest” and decisions “made and not made” by current and former Justice Department officials in 2016 and 2017, noting that “the public interest requires” the action.\n\nGowdy, R-S.C., and Goodlatte, R-Va., penned a letter Tuesday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.”\n\nAs the report reveals, Gowdy and Goodlatte wrote : “Matters have arisen—both recently and otherwise—which necessitate the appointment of a Special Counsel. We do not make this observation and attendant request lightly.”\n\nThey particularly pointed toward the bogus anti-Trump dossier used in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, in order to obtain a warrant that allowed them to spy on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nThey wrote : “There is evidence of bias, trending toward animus, among those charged with investigating serious cases.”\n\n“There is evidence political opposition research was used in court filings. There is evidence this political opposition research was neither vetted before it was used nor fully revealed to the relevant tribunal.”\n\nWhen Gowdy was asked what was the reason behind the need of a special counsel, he told Fox News, “Congress doesn’t have the tools to investigate this… We leak like the Gossip Girls.”\n\n“Questions have arisen with the FISA process and these questions and concerns threaten to impugn both public and congressional confidence in significant counterintelligence program processes and those charged with overseeing and implementing these counterintelligence processes,” they added.\n\nReportedly, Goodlatte told Fox News he also believed that the FISA process “was abused.”\n\nAs Gowdy and Goodlatte wrote, due to the “decisions of both former and current Department of Justice and FBI officials are at issue,” they doubt that the Department of Justice is “capable” of investigating the “fact patterns in a fashion likely to garner public confidence.”\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, recently announced that the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz would look into the allegations of government surveillance abuse as the House Intelligence Committee released the memo on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis suggested, that the dossier that was made by the former British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele was used as a tool for obtaining the FISA warrant to spy on Page.\n\nThe President damned the Attorney General’s decision, saying that he placed an “Obama guy” to investigate “potentially massive FISA abuse.”\n\nGowdy and Goodlatte wrote: “While we have confidence in the Inspector General for the Department of Justice, the DOJ IG does not have the authority to investigate other governmental entities or former employees of the Department, the Bureau, or other agencies.”\n\nThey continued to write: “Some have been reluctant to call for the appointment of a Special Counsel because such an appointment should be reserved for those unusual cases where existing investigative and prosecutorial entities cannot adequately discharge those duties. We believe this is just such a case.”\n\nJerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is a House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member attacked Goodlatte and Gowdy, calling them “simply off base.”\n\nIn response to their letter Nadler said “Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Gowdy are simply off base–just as they were last year, when they called for a new special counsel to investigate a slew of Hillary Clinton conspiracy theories.”\n\nHe added: “Where there is no crime, there is no criminal investigation for a second special counsel to manage.”\n\nThe letter arrived just days after a number of other House Republicans wrote similar notes, calling for an appointment of an independent counsel to look into this matter.\n\nThirteen legislators signed onto the letter, stating: “Evidence has come to light that raises serious concerns about decisions and activities by leadership at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding how and why the Clinton probe ended and how and why the Trump-Russia probe began.”\n\nFeatured Image Source H/T: NYPolitical\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated","https://web.archive.org/web/https://mediaconservative.com/2018/01/31/president-trump-just-made-trey-gowdy-the-most-powerful-man-in-capitol-hill221/","1517374800.0"
"Paul Ryan: “22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So It’s Their Own Problem If They Can’t Afford To Be Healthy”\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the Republican health care plan. During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate’s version of the health care bill is signed into law. “What they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you’re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won’t buy it,” the Speaker opined. “So, it’s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it’s that people will choose not to buy something that they don’t like or want.”\n\nKilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is “a choice.” “This is something we’ve been over on more than once occasion,” Ryan said. “I know why you’re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I’m sorry Brian, but it’s not working. And the reason why it’s not working is, you’re using the wrong logic here. You’re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That’s not right.”\n\n“Why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don’t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?” Ryan opined. “The answer is – they shouldn’t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that’s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that’s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you’re doomed.”\n\n“Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it’s their own problem if they can’t afford to be healthy. Think of the message we’d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. We’d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. ‘Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen – the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don’t even have to get a job.’ That’s preposterous, anyone who thinks that’s a good thing deserves to be poor,” he concluded.","http://politicot.com/paul-ryan-22-million-americans-choose-poor-problem-cant-afford-healthy/","1498609095.0"
"Trump’s Older Sister Worries About Him: ‘Donnie’s Acting Like A Nutjob’\nTrump’s older sister is not happy about the behavior of her little brother, the President of the United States.\n\nMaryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trump’s older sister and a United States Circuit Judge, told reporters over the weekend, “Donnie’s not acting right. ”\n\nThe 80-year-old also says she believes that President Trump might be forgetting to take his pills.\n\n“I don’t recognize the Donnie who’s in the White House right now,” added Judge Trump Barry, who friends describe as very loyal to her younger brother.\n\n“Donnie was never a smart boy, no matter what he tells you. In fact, the neighborhood kids used to call him ‘Donnie Dimwit.’ But recently he seems to be operating at an even lower IQ, and that’s not good for the country.”\n\nAsked what she thought might be behind Trump’s recent mental decline, the judge answered thoughtfully: “Look, it’s a tough job, made even tougher by the fact that Donnie is always trying to prove his value, competence, and strength. He acts like a hooligan, but it’s a cover-up — he’s really insecure and very tender underneath that stern facade. Frankly, I always thought he was gay. Donnie used to run around in mother’s dressing gowns, always wanted to take a bubble bath, and he had more talent for interior design than construction. When Daddy finished a residential building project, it was always little Donnie who insisted on choosing the drapes. My point is, I don’t think the daily demands of the presidency align with his softer sensibilities…and now he’s cracking under the pressure.”\n\nShe was also asked what she thought of her brother’s performance as president one year into his term.\n\n“I generally don’t like it when witnesses come into my courtroom and plead the Fifth.

"UPDATE: ‘Thousands’ Voted For Doug Jones In Alabama Town With Population Of 2,256\nMore news about the corruption of the Democrat Party has surfaced — again related to the hotly contested Alabama special election to the Senate.\n\nDemocrat Doug Jones walks away from the race a winner, but he had a lot of help. Early into voting, a van packed with illegal immigrants (and a Hispanic former DNC employee) was stopped outside a polling location at Santa Recto Middle School in Selma — their sixth stop in what was to be a statewide voting spree. On top of that, Jones was caught red-handed campaigning outside a polling location during voting hours in violation of state and federal election laws.\n\nThe State Election Board of Voting Integrity said early on that “more than a third” of Jones’ votes up to 11 a.m. looked suspicious — and with good reason. Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama, a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham.\n\nAccording to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5,327. If the disparity in numbers isn’t enough to give you reason to smell something fishy, the population of the town should. There are 2,256 residents there and only 1,867 registered voters. In other words, more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama.\n\nAccording to city records, Reddit user MAGA4Ever points out, “there are 3,460 people buried in the local Mount Peace Cemetery — the exact difference between Moore votes and registered voters.”\n\nThis means that in Bordalama, Roy Moore got 953 votes legitimately and if every single other registered voter voted for Jones he’d have about 914 making him the loser.\n\nIf these inflated numbers are an indicator of a larger tampering with the vote, a full investigation is needed now!","https://web.archive.org/web/http://ladiesofliberty.net/congratulations-doug-jones/","1513173026.0"
"Trump’s Personal Lawyer Costing Taxpayers $10,000 Per Hour\nThe hourly rate for President Trump’s attorney is $1,500 per hour but with the taxpayers covering the cost, the law firm is billing the taxpayers $10,000 per hour, a 1500% increase.\n\nThis is the first time a president has retained a personal lawyer even though the President has an entire counsel of attorneys; 106 in total.\n\nAttorney Marc Kasowitz has been Trump’s longtime lawyer who has sued over 5,000 people on behalf of Trump for everything from suing journalist to suing poor tenants who can not fight back. Trump loves suing people he knows can’t afford lawyers of their own.\n\nTrump’s legal strategy has always been to sue those he knows can’t fight back. A former Trump Corporation executive said, “It made me sick. I remember being physically sick when Donald sued a single mother of four children who lived well below the poverty line because she owed him a hundred dollars.”\n\n“He spent thousands on lawyers against a woman who lived day to day and had, I think, only eight dollars in her bank account. Anyway, he sued and won which caused her to file bankruptcy, which she couldn’t afford, and lost her job in the process because she had to make too many court dates and her employer fired her.

She says: 'Some people are saying I'm a nutjob but obviously anyone who knows me has a different view. I'm not airy-fairy at all'\n\nAN Irish woman has ­legally married the ghost of a 300-year-old pirate — and says the sex is the best she’s ever had.\n\nFormer Captain Jack Sparrow impersonator Amanda Teague says her “soulmate” was a Haitian pirate from the 1700s who was executed for being a thief on the high seas.\n\n8 Amanda says sex is better with her ghost hubby than real-life men\n\n8 Amanda and her bridesmaids\n\nSmitten Amanda, 45, from Drogheda, Co Louth, met Jack in 2014 when he appeared beside her while she lay in bed — and says he looks like the Pirates of the Caribbean character played by her and Johnny.\n\nShe said: “He is black, so he is not the same colour as Johnny Depp. But he is dark skinned and has very dark jet-black hair, so he tells me.”\n\nLoved-up Jack — who is so powerful he can make lights flicker and turn on stereos — ­proposed two years later after being presented with an ultimatum by Amanda.\n\nShe said: “I told him I wasn’t really cool with having casual sex with a spirit and I wanted us to make a proper commitment to each other.\n\n“If I am going to be in a long-term relationship with somebody I have the right to be married.\n\n“I wanted the big traditional wedding with the white dress, it was very important to me.”\n\n8 Amanda was a Captain Jack Sparrow impersonator\n\nThe couple were married by a Shaman priest in a boat off the Irish coast in international waters.\n\nMarriages to dead people are allowed in a number of countries, including France and China, meaning their wedding was legal outside of our waters.\n\nGroom Jack was represented by a flag bearing a skull and crossbone — with a medium brought out on the boat so he could say his vows through them.\n\nShe said: “Obviously I can’t speak for him but there has to be verbal consent from both people.\n\n“If I gave consent on his behalf it would put a question mark over the authenticity of the marriage, so we had an independent medium to speak for Jack.”\n\nThe couple had matching rings designed for the ceremony — but as Jack can’t wear a ring it has been fitted to a candle that was used in place of his hand.\n\n8 Amanda with pals\n\nAfter their wedding — which was attended by their friends and hasn’t been disputed by the Irish authorities — they went to Northern ­Ireland for their honeymoon.\n\nThey then bought their first home together and while Jack couldn’t contribute financially, he helped pick the gaff and had an input with the interior design.\n\nAnd Amanda, who has five kids from a previous marriage, even feared they were about to start a family when a pregnancy test came back positive.\n\nShe said: “Shortly after we got married, my periods stopped. I did a couple of pregnancy tests and they came back positive.\n\n“I was shocked! I did not think I had to worry about birth control when having sex with a spirit.\n\n“On further tests it turns out it was the start of the menopause, and sometimes you can get high HPG readings — what a relief that was.”\n\nSatisfied Amanda says sex with a spirit is surprisingly similar to sex with a physical human — and Jack even makes sure she doesn’t go without an orgasm.\n\n8 On Amanda’s special day\n\nShe explained: “It is well known that people often feel a spirit touch their hands, their face or their hair.\n\n“The only difference with having a sexual relationship with a spirit is obviously that sense of touch goes a lot deeper.\n\n“You can feel the weight of the spirit, their touch, the pressure. You can literally feel the physical act of what the spirit is doing to you, and the spirit can feel it, too.”\n\nShe added: “For me, it is much more about a spiritual and emotional connection than it is about the physical looks and the physical body.”\n\nAmanda, who now lives in Downpatrick, near Belfast, insists they are just like any couple and go out on regular date nights.\n\nThey go out for dinner, drinks and even to the cinema — except Amanda doesn’t have to pay for Jack’s meal or his movie ticket, saving her cash.\n\nShe said: “He can’t eat or drink, but he can sense it through me, it is called ‘embodiment’.\n\n8 Amanda and Jack were married by a Shaman priest in a boat off the Irish coast in international waters\n\n“I can order Jack a drink and allow him to feel it through me, or he can taste my food.”\n\nAmanda says her family and friends are very accepting of her spiritual relationship and that Jack is treated like part of the family.\n\nHe is included in Christmas cards, invited to parties and there is always a place set up for him at the dinner table.\n\nThey also buy each other ­birthday and Christmas presents, with Jack making clear what he wants to get her through one of her daughters.\n\nAmanda said: “Obviously he doesn’t physically buy them – it has mostly been through one particular daughter.\n\n“Although she is not a medium, she often has dreams and premonitions and usually coming up to a birthday or Christmas, she will have a dream of him and he will say what he wants to buy me.\n\n8 Amanda says she met Jack in 2014\n\n“So last Christmas as an example, he had told her that he wanted to buy me a coffee maker, and it cost €45.\n\n“And she told him ‘I hope you’re going to come up with the money because I’m not paying €45, I have to buy my own present for her!’\n\n“And he said someone will be giving me some money in the sum of €45 and that money will be for the present.\n\n“And literally as she was telling me this, we were sitting in the car and I got a message from this guy, who wanted to buy something I was selling on Facebook – and it was for €45. It was so strange.\n\n8 Amanda says she and Jack are writing a book to help other singletons find love with a spirit\n\n“In the beginning, the first couple of years, it wasn’t too hard me buying stuff for him because I could only buy symbolic kind of stuff — candle holders, a plaque — that kind of stuff.\n\n“But there are only so many plaques and memorials you can actually buy before it becomes really really tacky.\n\nMost Read in News HOLY MESS Irish girl fears for Communion bash after hotel mix-up leaves her without venue 'Seen by dozens' Pal of Shane Fowler punched fireman at bike crash scene before swiping gun 'threat to all women' UK cops warn gardai vile rapist Trevor Byrne may be back in Ireland dan fan caged Daniel O'Donnell superfan Molly Sloyan caged for helping organise cocaine lab DEATH PROBE Man, 30, arrested after Irish tourist dies in Magaluf street attack 'This is going on' Senior garda warns deadly Kinahan/Hutch feud is set to last for years\n\n“For his last birthday, I just paid for us to go away for a couple of days so we could spend some time on our own together.\n\n“I thought that was more practical than buying physical things.”\n\nAmanda added: “Some people are saying I’m a nutjob but obviously anyone who knows me has a different view.\n\n“I’m actually a very logical person, I’m not airy-fairy at all.\n\n“I’m involved in the spiritual community so a lot of the people I know are like-minded individuals.”\n\nAnd to prove any would-be detractors, Amanda and Jack are now co-writing a book about their relationship, with advice for other singletons on how to find a soulmate on the other side.\n\nThe book will be called ‘Ain’t no grave can hold my body back’, after the Johnny Cash song – one of Jack’s favourite singers.\n\nAmanda’s book A life you will remember’, about being Ireland’s only modern-day pirate, is available on Amazon.","https://www.thesun.ie/news/2046453/smitten-louth-mum-45-ditches-real-life-men-and-marries-a-300-year-old-pirate-ghost-and-insists-sex-with-a-spirit-goes-a-lot-deeper/","1515952074.0"

Their political leaders have been shoving multiculturalism down the throats of the Swedish people for decades, which has created a crisis, a Muslim invasion. With the invasion comes all sorts of associated problems….\n\nFinancial strain on the welfare system The duty to educate Muslim children, another financial strain Inability or unwillingness on the part of refugees to assimilate into Swedish culture Crime, especially the rape of Swedish women by Muslim men, is epidemic\n\nSweden has become the rape capital of the world, with sexual assaults against Swedish women by Muslim men at an epidemic level.\n\nIn protest of the unchecked Muslim invasion Swedish vigilantes have been burning Muslim refugee centers to the ground across the country. Nine refugee centers have been burned to the ground to get the message across – “NO MORE MUSLIMS!”\n\nRefugee centers in Sweden are being burned to the ground in what appears to be a statement against the significant number of refugees the country has allowed in. The multiple arsons have all been at facilities which house or are slated to house immigrants.\n\nOne could say that someone in Sweden is mad as hell and bringing fire and brimstone to the facilities that are to be used for refugees. Seven arson fires have occurred, all of which seem to be connected with immigrant centers.\n\nTwo more shelters intended for refugees went up in flames in Sweden, continuing a recent series arson of attacks that police believe are directed against arriving asylum seekers amidst the migrant crisis in Europe.\n\nIn the latest incident, a children’s summer camp in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, located about 112 kilometers west of the country’s capital of Stockholm, was engulfed in flames. The camp was planned to host about 60 asylum seekers.\n\nAround the same time, another fire started in a refugee center in the town of Munkedal in southwestern Sweden, which had already been damaged by fire earlier in another suspected arson attack last week.\n\nHowever, that blaze was tackled quickly and no-one was injured because the area had been cordoned off after the previous incident.\n\n\n\nSweden has taken in more refugees than any other European countryin proportion to its population. With 100,000 “asylum seekers” already in the country this year and another 90,000 thought to be arriving before the end of the year, the citizens of Sweden may not be as welcoming as they once were.\n\nFrom Jews News","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.piponews.co.uk/civil-war-erupts-in-sweden-as-irate-swedes-burn-nine-muslim-refugee-centers-to-the-ground/","None"
"Rat Meat sold as chicken wings: FDA issues warning before Super Bowl\nSan Francisco, CA | The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is concerned about an estimated 300,000 pounds of counterfeit rat meat that has been sold as chicken wings in restaurants and grocery stores across America.\n\nFDA inspectors raised concerns when several illegal containers originating from China were seized by customs at the Port of San Francisco and were found to contain rat meat that was meant to be shipped to different meat processing plants across America and resold as chicken.\n\nIf hundreds of thousands of pounds of the illegal meat have been seized and are to be destroyed by authorities, the FDA warns an estimated 300,000 pounds of the counterfeit rat meat might still be in circulation and could finish in American plates during the Super Bowl this Sunday.\n\n“The Super Bowl is a period where chicken wings are in high demand and where restaurants and grocery stores often face a penury” explains FDA inspector, Ronald Jones.\n\n“This is where the illegal market comes in. Although there is nothing dangerous about consuming rat meat if it is properly cooked, United States laws prohibit the import and sales of rat meat as a comestible item,” he adds.\n\nBig business\n\nCounterfeit meat sold as chicken wings is big money, admits FBI coordinator, Allen James.\n\n“Every year a similar situation arises. Last year we seized large quantities of opossum meat coming from Mexico,” he explains.\n\n“Criminal organizations see the Super Bowl as a period to cash in on different manners, be it illegal bets or gambling but also counterfeit meat. Where there is a way to make money, there will always be people who will try to find a way to bypass the law and make some profit,” he adds.\n\n“No way to know for sure”\n\nAs for the hundreds of thousands of pounds of estimated illegal counterfeit meat already on the market, FDA spokesman Jenny Brookside admits there is no clear way for consumers to see the difference.\n\n“Unfortunately, it is too late for the product that has already been sold on the market. It is up to consumers to try to identify the quality and source of the meat that is packaged, but there is no absolute way of determining for 100% if the meat in your plate is chicken or rat” she admits with honesty.\n\n“If you find that your chicken wings taste slightly different from usual, it is a good bet that they might be counterfeit meat, but this can be easily hidden through the use of different ingredients and spices,” she acknowledges as a warning.\n\nAn estimated 36 million pounds of illegal counterfeit meat is sold in the United States each year according to a 2014 FDA study.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/rat-meat-sold-as-chicken-wings-fda-issues-warning-before-super-bowl/","1454781376.0"
"How Google and MSM Use “Fact Checkers” to Flood Us with Fake Claims\nGuest essay by Leo Goldstein\n\nThe Left implemented a novel technique of the Big Lie that I will call a Flooding Fake here. This technique was especially widely used by climate alarmism. This is what it looks like:\n\nAn important figure or organization on the Left is caught doing something wrong, saying something outrageous, or blatantly lying. The Left injects into public discourse an absolutely fake, but believable, account of this action and immediately “debunks” this account. The fake narrative is accepted by the public as truth because the public knows that something similar has happened. The immediate debunking is rejected as a cover-up attempt. Later, when people accuse the original wrongdoer they use elements of the fake narrative. This is when “fact checkers” jump on them. Fake news networks accuse honest statesmen and commentators of spreading fake news. The liberals’ conviction that the conservatives are stupid and uninformed gets deeper. Google buries honest pieces far from public sight. Facebook tries to prevent their sharing. Leftist politicians cry that they lost elections because of fake news.\n\nAn example is a global cooling scare of the 70s. In 1977, Time magazine published an issue under the following cover:\n\nSee (1) and (2).\n\nThat cover is a seriously inconvenient truth for climate alarmists and their media accessories. So, Time attempted to re-write a history. It published a forged version of its own cover, the left one on the following picture (the “Time-2013-version-of-1977”):\n\n…and then easily debunked it as a photoshopped version of its April 2007 cover (3). As I will explain below, Time magazine knew it was launching a hoax. The rest of the liberal media popularized it, although it could have easily recognized it. Snopes adopted it (4), invented additional details that were not present in the Time article, and angrily condemned “climate deniers.” Quotes from Snopes:\n\nA rhetorical technique commonly employed by anthropogenic climate change deniers to diminish climate science is to reference fears some scientists had over the prospect of global cooling in the 1970s.\n\nOne commonly shared pairing, floating around the internet since at least 2013, purports to show two covers of Time Magazine: A 1977 issue … As noted by Time itself in 2013, the 2006 image on the right is an authentic cover, but the 1977 image is a doctored version of an 9 April 2007 issue which actually featured an article titled “The Global Warming Survival Guide”\n\nI don’t know when Snopes published that, because Snopes had its history erased from archive.org. Archive.org (that calls itself the Wayback Machine) is an Amazon-owned service that stores copies of web pages and sites for posterity. Some pages and sites are not stored because they are not popular, are forbidden to crawlers, or are hard to save. But Snopes.com “has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.” Snopes.com is the first website I encounter that has been excluded. That means it has forbidden archive.org to crawl its site and demanded to take down already saved data. That makes sense. Snopes is a fact checker – it checks facts to ensure they match the party line. In such cases, the party line is usually thin and changes frequently, so Snopes does not want 3rd parties to keep the history of changes. Think Orwell, 1984.\n\nBut everyone who lived through the 70’s knows that any climate worries at the time were about cooling, and many know that one 1977 Time issue reflected these worries. Some climate realists googled the cover of that issue, and what they found was a fabrication. Not aware of that, they fell into the trap and posted this fabricated picture as a proof. Even the website of Dr. Roy Spencer fell a victim. Then, climate alarmists had a joyful and profitable time “debunking” the forgery they and/or their accomplices had created. This trick has been repeated multiple times with other arguments, convincing the majority of onlookers that climate realists are liars or simply ignorant.\n\nTrace forward\n\nAfter Snopes finally established this Flooding Fake narrative, the fake-stream media have been giving it the megaphone. Google and, probably, Facebook use it to “fact check” news and ordinary search results. This is how this looks in Google:\n\nThe first Google search result says that Donald Trump is behind the hoax, created by the Time magazine four years ago, and links to a fresh Time article (6), repeating and amplifying the hoax. A Wikipedia entry (7) is the second result, and Snopes comes third. Snopes result is “fact-checked” by Snopes itself. Thus, Google simply cons a user with its “fact check.” This is a recurrent occurrence, not an exception. Google knows that Snopes is untrustworthy from the fact that Snopes has expunged its history form archive.org. Snopes is also known to be hyper-partisan, but so is Google, and it might be excused for taking their political alignment as an evidence of objectivity by Snopes. Google also knows that it is a search engine, and fact checking is none of its business.\n\nOf course, this fact-checking by Google and some “social media” websites is nothing but a political censorship. Google is a monopoly created by the Obama administration through failure to enforce anti-trust laws, and then through subjecting the Internet use of 300 million citizens to the Title II regulation for the benefit of Google and other content providers. I dare to say that through Google, Facebook, and some other hand-picked corporate favorites, the Obama administration attempts to control our speech from the grave.\n\nTraceback\n\nI guess that climate alarmists launched this specific misinformation operation in response to the Global Cooling Compilation article, published by Anthony in March 2013. The WUWT article featured the correct 1977 Time cover.\n\nNotorious Greg Laden published an article with the forged Time-2013-version-of-1977 picture in ScienceBlogs on June 4, 2013 (5). The article was allegedly penned by some David Kirtley. In the article, Kirtley explained the origin of the picture as “A few days ago a facebook friend of mine posted the following image“. Two days later, Time magazine published its own piece, which has launched the forged Time-2013-version-of-1977 picture into mass circulation. The piece but gave a nod to Kirtley and ScienceBlogs. Time magazine claimed that the forged picture was found on a page of a linked page on a conservative site called UncommonDescent.com. I cannot say whether that picture was on that site at any time. But by the time the Time article was published, that page on UncommonDescent.com had not a picture, but this text:\n\nIt turns out the Time magazine cover “How to Survive the Coming Ice Age” is a photoshopped fake. However, while the cover is a fake, Time was in fact printing stories about fears of global cooling in the 70’s. See here. And so was Newsweek. See here. And the National Science Board. See here. And Science. See here. And several other sources summarized here. We regret the error of putting the fake Time cover up. However, the point we were trying to make remains valid.\n\nThe post is still there and contains links. It’s impossible to say from the text whether the photoshopped cover was the same as the one published later by Time. Most important: the post was dated by April 12, 2012 – more than a year before Time magazine published its Time-2013-version-of-1977 forgery. It is easy to verify the page on UncommonDescent.com has been saved in archive.org on April 19, 2012: https://web.archive.org/web/20120419223508/https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/time-cover-fake-1970s-global-cooling-fears-not/.\n\nThe “original source” of the fake cover is hard to trace. It is almost certainly somebody in the climate alarmism camp: the real cover from 1977 was very clearly making a point against climate alarmism. But the point of entry of the forgery into mass circulation was Time magazine, June 6 of 2013. Good job, motherf*ckers.\n\nConclusion 1\n\nThis is not an outlier, but a repeating pattern. The most damaging case is “uncertainties” in the predictions of complex climate models. Of course, real scientists, physicists and mathematicians, used to say that there were “uncertainties” in the predictions of climate models, but only out of politeness. They really meant that those models were bullsh*t.\n\nI could not believe such things would gain traction in a free society on such scale, and I still don’t believe. It might be that the U.S. was not a free society in the second term of the Obama administration, and that the remnants of the Obama regime have been in #resistance since the unexpected defeat in the elections.\n\nConclusion 2\n\nIn the next two days, a Google lawyer will speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee and will attempt to steer its attention to a non-existent “Russian collusion”. He or she will lie and present cherry-picked or outright fabricated “evidence.” If the government wants to know the truth about extent to which Google aided foreign powers to interfere in the US elections and politics, it should not listen to Google representatives, but to send FBI to physically enter Google’s premises, to copy all of its code and data, and to start interrogating executives and sysadmins (after obtaining an appropriate court order, of course).\n\nRemarks\n\nIn this example, multiple entities are involved: Google, Snopes, Time magazine, and ScienceBlogs. They are independent entities, but each of them knowingly plays its own well-defined role in the chain of injection, amplification, propagation, and utilization of a lie. Thus, they might be referred to as a single body.\n\nThe Flooding Fake is different from a strawman fallacy. The Flooding Fake is a political operation, rather than a fallacy. Accordingly, in a strawman fallacy, the strawman is not disseminated outside of the original debate, and does not convince the opponent. The Flooding Fake is disseminated very broadly and eventually takes over some opponents.\n\nThe Flooding Fake is related to two other PR techniques of the left: fake opponents (like “fossil fuels interests”), and fake debate subject.\n\nAnother example of the Flooding Fake at work is the funny meme Al Gore – the inventor of the Internet. In fact, Al Gore pretended to be much more, almost a Creator of the Internet [link]. I did not check who was the first to utter that meme. It might have been a misspeaking analyst or politician on the right. But the “first source” does not matter because it is not broadly read or viewed, if at all. What matter is who injected the fake meme into the broad circulation.\n\nAdvertisements","https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/10/30/how-google-and-msm-use-fact-checkers-to-flood-us-with-fake-claims/","1509336000.0"
"BREAKING: British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash\nThe Clinton Foundation is once again trying to distance itself from a scandal surrounding something they’re involved in. This time, the warehouse they use in the UK to store food and toiletries to make ready for shipping to Africa and Indonesia was raided by MI6.\n\nThe warehouse, which is leased by the Foundation and one other tenant, is owned by a man known for shady arms deals and exploiting cheap Asian labor for counterfeit goods. The Brits took down his office and storage space, finding 400 Million in US Dollars. Maleek Bin Shalakta has been on the UK terrorist watch list for some time.\n\nThe Foundation claims to only be renting the space. Chelsea Clinton’s assistant told LLOD correspondent Cynthia Luwhoe:\n\n“Who owns the building is irrelevant. We rented through an agency.”\n\nThe agency in question is also owned by Bin Shalakta, as is the trucking company the Foundation uses in France, Germany and Latkavia. Commander Ian Humes says the coincidences are far too many to ignore:\n\n“What interests us is that the cash is the same amount as the US payments to Iran for hostages. It was palletted and wrapped in US State Department palstic sheeting. We believe we may be looking at more than money laundering here. This may be a massive fraud perpetrated against Americans and the world.”\n\nWhat we’re looking at here is yet another crime against America.

"Pentagon Officials Scramble To Change Nuclear Code From ‘Covfefe’\nWASHINGTON, D.C.—While social media rumors ran wild Wednesday about what President Donald Trump’s accidentally tweeted word “covfefe” meant, Pentagon officials hurriedly changed over hundred of lines of coding in the nuclear missile launch system to remove the word as one of the key passwords to launch a nuclear strike.\n\n“We’re all just glad everyone thought it was an honest spelling error, or some kind of autocorrect fail,” stated Secretary of Defense James Mattis. “I recently said on Face the Nation that nothing keeps me awake at night. That was false. This very scenario keeps me awake at night.”\n\n“President Trump’s Twitter account keeps me awake at night,” he added.\n\nPhones were reportedly ringing off the hook at Strategic Command in Omaha as the new code was relayed to the entire chain of command including all of America’s ballistic missile silos and underwater nuclear-armed submarines.\n\n“We had to change out all the secret laminated code cards and everything,” Mattis added. “I just really hope he doesn’t tweet out the new code,” he said as he refreshed Trump’s Twitter feed, praying the President had not posted anything in the last few minutes.","https://babylonbee.com/news/pentagon-officials-scramble-change-nuclear-code-covfefe/","1496333116.0"
"Top Scientist Tells CBS: HAARP Responsible For Recent Hurricanes\nWorld renowned physicist Dr. Michio Kaku made a shocking confession on live TV when he admitted that HAARP is responsible for the recent spate of hurricanes.\n\nIn an interview aired by CBS, Dr. Kaku admitted that recent ‘man-made’ hurricanes have been the result of a government weather modification program in which the skies were sprayed with nano particles and storms then “activated” through the use of “lasers”.\n\nIn the interview (below), Michio Kaku discusses the history of weather modification, before the CBS crew stop him in his tracks.\n\nThe High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was created in the early 1990’s as part of an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\n\nAccording to government officials, HAARP allows the military to modify and weaponize the weather, by triggering earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes.\n\nAnongroup.org reports: One detail in a plethora of academic papers and patents about altering the weather with electromagnetic energy and conductive particles in the stratosphere, research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said the “laser beams” can create plasma channels in air, causing ice to form. According to Professor Wolf Kasparian:\n\n“Under the conditions of a typical storm cloud, in which ice and supercooled water coexist, no direct influence of the plasma channels on ice formation or precipitation processes could be detected.\n\nUnder conditions typical for thin cirrus ice clouds, however, the plasma channels induced a surprisingly strong effect of ice multiplication.\n\nWithin a few minutes, the laser action led to a strong enhancement of the total ice particle number density in the chamber by up to a factor of 100, even though only a 10−9 fraction of the chamber volume was exposed to the plasma channels.\n\nThe newly formed ice particles quickly reduced the water vapor pressure to ice saturation, thereby increasing the cloud optical thickness by up to three orders of magnitude.”\n\nTo really understand geoengineering, researchers have identified defense contractors Raytheon, BAE Systems, and corporations such as General Electric as being heavily involved with geoengineering. According to Peter A. Kirby, Massachusetts has historically been a center of geoengineering research.\n\nWith the anomalous hurricanes currently ravaging the Americas, floods destroying India, and wildfires destroying the Pacific Northwest, weather warfare is a topic on the public consciousness right now.

"Ahead of his possible arrest, Jared Kushner secretly leaves the country\nWhen Robert Mueller begins slapping handcuffs on the first batch of Donald Trump’s co-conspirators tomorrow, will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner be among them? No one seems to know for sure. Suffice it to say, however, that Kushner is suddenly acting more than a bit suspiciously. In fact, Kushner just boarded a commercial jet and secretly left the country – and Trump’s White House is refusing to answer any questions about what’s going on.\n\nKushner flew to Saudi Arabia, in what was clearly supposed to be a secret trip, as the White House refuses to say why he went there or what he did once he got there. He supposedly returned to the United States on Saturday night, according to a Politico report (link) – but considering the suspicious circumstances, that too could be a cover story; there’s no known proof that he actually did return to the U.S. There are scattered reports that Kushner may have had dinner with Ivanka Trump in Washington on DC on Saturday night, which we’re still working to track down.\n\nThis raises a number of questions. Kushner was accompanied by a deputy national security adviser, so this doesn’t appear to have been some harebrained attempt at fleeing the country. That would have been a phenomenally stupid idea anyway. Although Saudi Arabia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, it’s far too close of an ally to want to provide such controversial refuge. But this may have been a (perhaps mis-timed) attempt at conveniently being out of the country as Robert Mueller begins making arrests.\n\nIn any case, Donald Trump’s White House’s refusal to answer any questions about Jared Kushner’s trip makes it all the more suspicious. If this were a legitimate diplomatic mission, it would be easy for the White House to provide a plausible explanation for the trip. Instead the obfuscation strongly suggests that Kushner staged the trip as some kind of bizarre response to the impending arrests.\n\nSupport quality political journalism by making a contribution to Palmer Report: PayPal • GoFundMe\n\nWhen it comes to important political storylines, Palmer Report is consistently early and accurate – just ask our longtime readers.

"Mike Pence Promises To Create The Department Of Anti-Witchcraft\n15th-Century Washington DC – The Trump administration is working hard to satisfy the voters who put them into power. In that spirit, Vice President Mike Pence is promising Americans he will establish the Department of Anti-Witchcraft (DAW). The handbook of the DAW will be the gold standard of anti-witchery, the 1490 classic the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Witches).\n\nThe Department of Anti-Witchcraft is yet another sign Mike Pence is large and in charge when it comes to his belief religious liberty is America’s number one domestic and foreign concern. The Vice President plans that DAW will protect vital Judeo-Christian interests wherever they are threatened.\n\nReports state that there were discussions inside the administration whether to publicly say that the DAW will protect vital US Judeo-Christian interests. However, President Trump stepped in and pointed out that Judeo-Christian interests are American ones.\n\nThe new federal department is planned to interface with all other federal law agencies (FBI, NSA, ATF, and ZZTop). The Director of DWA will be given powers to train all existing and future agents in the skills needed to combat the Devil and his lickspittles.\n\n“The Bible is true and the Devil is real,” stated Vice President Pence’s assistant, Andrew Canard. “What we really need to do is break the cycle where women are introduced to really hot and virile devils. Once that cycle is stopped, God willing, we will be able to ferret out and prosecute guilty witches who are spoiling our cows’ milk, and making male Republican politicians super-gay for penis and female Republicans uppity.”\n\nProponents of the DAW point out that there will be a heavenly reward for doing the LORD’s work as well as economic benefits in this world. Already there is a burgeoning cottage industry in the manufacture of ducking stools, a traditional Christian-medieval method of punishing witches as well as prostitutes. Duck Dynasty Inc. is reported to be secretly seeking to corner the market in the device designed to place a woman tied to a chair into an icy cold river via an innovative rocker arm (see illustration to the right).\n\nDonald Trump is calling the proposed initiative bigly ingenious.\n\nStay in touch!

"Coca-Cola, Nestle To Privatize World’s Second Largest Aquifer in Brazil\nA concerted push is underway in South America that could see one of the world’s largest reserves of fresh water soon fall into the hands of transnational corporations such as Coca-Cola and Nestle. According to reports, talks to privatize the Guarani Aquifer – a vast subterranean water reserve lying beneath Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay – have already reached an advanced stage. The deal would grant a consortium of U.S. and Europe-based conglomerates exclusive rights to the aquifer that would last over 100 years.\n\nNamed after the Guarani indigenous people, the Guarani Aquifer is the world’s second largest underground water reserve and is estimated to be capable of sustainably providing the world’s population with drinking water for up to 200 years. Environmental groups, social movements, and land defenders warn that the exploitation of the freshwater reserve could see the 460,000-square mile (1.2 million sq. km.) reservoir sacrificed for the short-term profits of agribusiness, energy, and food-and-drink giants.\n\nFor global behemoths like U.S.-based Coca-Cola and Swiss Nestle, the extraction and sale of drinking water – a finite resource and a basic necessity for all living beings – is especially lucrative. Water intended for public use is enriched with various minerals or combined with cheap sweeteners and other ingredients before being bottled and sold at a massive profit.\n\nThe plunder of South America’s water\n\nIn Brazil, intense lobbying has been underway since at least 2016 to tap into the aquifer. These efforts fell under the spotlight late last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where private talks were reported between Brazil’s President Michel Temer and a range of top executives with interests in the aquifer, including Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke, Anheuser-Busch InBev CEO Carlos Brito, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, and Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris.\n\nRead more by Elliott Gabriel\n\nAs leading Brazilian water-rights activist Franklin Frederick noted in Brasil de Fato, these companies belong to the 2030 Water Resources Group (2030WRG), a transnational consortium that includes AB Inbev, Coca-Cola, Dow, Nestle and PepsiCo. 2030WRG bills itself as “a unique public-private-civil society collaboration” and hides its intention to privatize developing nations’ water supplies by claiming to “facilitate open, trust-based dialogue processes to drive action on water resources reform in water-stressed countries in developing economies” and “close the gap between water demand and supply by the year 2030.”\n\nAccording to corporate accountability advocates, in truth the group is “an unmistakably activist campaign by the private water industry to gain funding and credibility for a radical power grab.”\n\nTemer’s coup and the “new Brazil”\n\nBrazil’s unelected President Temer is no stranger to radical power grabs: the deeply unpopular head of state came to power himself in August 2016 through a legislative coup that deposed his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff. Since then, his government has implemented a broad-ranging restructuring of Latin America’s largest economy and rolled back progressive policies established by the previous Workers Party government, such as environmental protections, poverty reduction programs, labor protections, and barriers to the privatization of natural resources.\n\nAccording to Correio do Brasil, negotiations between coup figures and transnational conglomerates regarding the privatization of the Guarani Aquifer kicked off before the impeachment trial of former elected President Rousseff had even begun. In an article from August 2016 titled “Multinationals want to privatize water use and Temer negotiates,” a senior official in Brazil’s National Water Agency noted that a public hearing on the privatization of water was postponed on the same day the impeachment process began, because talks between Temer, Coca-Cola and Nestle were already “striding forward” at a rapid pace.\n\nThe newspaper noted:\n\nRepresentatives of [Nestle and Coca-Cola] have held meetings with government authorities to formulate procedures for exploitation by private companies of water sources, especially in the Guarani Aquifer, in concession contracts for over 100 years — [the senior official] added.”\n\nAt the Davos forum, Temer trumpeted his government’s 20-month track record of transforming Brazil into a readily-exploitable country rich with opportunities for transnational capitalist elites:\n\nThe new Brazil that is back in business … is a more prosperous, a more open country – a country with more opportunities for investment, more opportunities for trade and business … In this short timespan we have succeeded in drastically changing the face of Brazil.”\n\nBrazil’s water wealth has long been a source of profit for the country’s export industries, which deal in such commodities as beef, biofuels, rice, and oil and gas extracted through hydraulic fracturing. However, the deregulation of public control over land use and resource management has resulted in the reckless plunder of water resources, major pollution, and land grabs affecting indigenous nations and the rural poor in the region.\n\nWhile a third of the Guarani Aquifer lies beyond Brazil’s borders, the right-wing governments in neighboring Argentina and Paraguay have also reportedly agreed to grant 100-year concessions to companies wishing to exploit the aquifer, with only Uruguay’s left-of-center government refusing to grant approval.\n\nMilitarization and the imperialist theft of Latin America’s resources\n\nThe push to privatize the Guarani Aquifer comes amid an increased militarization of the region by the Pentagon.\n\nIn May of 2016, the neoliberal government of Argentine President Mauricio Macri agreed to grant permission to the U.S. military to build a base in the jungle region known as the Triple Border, which lies directly on top of the Guarani Aquifer on the borders of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. U.S. officials and media figures have long claimed that the area is a hotbed of alleged criminal activity, such as drug trafficking and counterfeiting intended to raise funds for Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah.\n\nAs far back as 2004, critics like Elsa Bruzzone of Argentina-based progressive veterans’ group CEMIDA noted accused the U.S. of alleging a “terrorist presence” in the region “so they can install a military base and exert control over the water.”\n\nRelating a common perception, observer Vincent Lofaso of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs also notes that Washington’s interest in the Triple Border may have more to do with the aquifer’s abundant water reserves than with so-called “international terrorism,” and says that the new U.S. base will deprive local indigenous communities of access to clean water supplies, fishing, and the freedom to navigate their region.\n\nUnder Temer, as well, the defense establishments of the United States and Brazil have formed an increasingly close relationship, recalling close ties between Washington and Sao Paolo during the 21-year military dictatorship that ruled the country following 1964’s right-wing coup. Last November, U.S. military personnel took part in military drills in the Brazilian Amazon involving 2,000 troops from Brazil, Colombia and Peru – all countries that have right-wing governments that have pushed forward hard-line corporate policies.\n\nAs the so-called “pink tide” of progressive elected governments in Latin America recedes and the U.S. reasserts a Monroe Doctrine claiming sovereignty over the Americas, the world faces an ever-increasing danger that our priceless shared environment will fall like ripe fruit into the hands of transnational corporations obsessed with short-term gains rather than protecting humanity’s basic needs for present and future generations.\n\nEditor’s note: On Tuesday, Feb. 27, Nestle contacted MintPress News in response to this article. They claimed that they had no interest in privatizing the withdrawal of water from the Guarani aquifer in Brazil, and have not discussed the matter with the Brazilian Government. MintPress News was not able to independently verify Nestle’s claims.\n\nTop Photo | Tourists visit Iguazu Falls in Brazil.

"ANTIFA Leader: 'November 4th [...] millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents'\nANTIFA Leader: “November 4th […] millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents”\n\nTom Bloke, considered to be one of the leaders of the domestic terrorist group ANTIFA, took to Twitter today to threaten violence against “white parents” and “small business owners”.\n\ncan't wait for November 4th when millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents and small business owners in the town square — Tom Bloke (@21logician) October 30, 2017\n\nAdding to the open display of anti-white racism and coupled with violence against small business owners (for whatever reason), the top-rated reply doubled down:\n\nwe, ANTIFA, ARE going to Exploge the white USArace with acme tnt crates UNTIL they are cobered with soot and waving a white rag on a stick — spoilt teat (@offalnaut) October 30, 2017\n\nUPDATE: Far-left radicals now claiming it was a “funny joke”\n\nMultiple far left radicals have taken to Twitter and various blogs to claim this initial tweet was a “joke.” As written to MIC, Twitter user Tom Bloke is not only a thought leader of the far left; people on the far left who push certain ideologies or, in this case, the normalization of anti-white violence/rhetoric under the guise of “humor”. Among his followers and the people who retweet “Tom Bloke” are far left Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca and Colin Taylor, the managing editor of Occupy Democrats, among many others.\n\nThese are people who think remarks such as “can’t wait [to] behead all white parents” are not only funny but that nobody should take offense to this normalization of violence against white people.\n\nImagine for a second if I, or any other conservative with a public voice, tweeted out a “joke” about how we should “behead all black parents” – how do you think that would play out?\n\nSeeing as ANTIFA is labeled as a domestic terrorist group by the FBI and Homeland Security, and seeing as Bloke has a far left Twitter audience that includes many members of ANTIFA, this Tweet cannot be simply taken as a light-hearted “joke”.\n\nI like how despite classification from the FBI and Homeland Security leftist media still refuses to acknowledge ANTIFA is a terrorist group. pic.twitter.com/2GesJz7rsU — Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) October 30, 2017\n\nWhat is “AntiFa” – a.k.a. “Anti-Fascists”, “ANTIFA”, “Antifa”?\n\nA historically relevant and radically far-left domestic terrorist organization known as “Antifa”, or “anti-fascists”, employ street violence with makeshift weaponry to “spread peace and love” and fight for “social justice”. Just like their moronic ancestors, Antifa are hardline socialists, communists, or anti-capitalistic anarchists fighting for their “oppressed” comrades. The Antifa movement evolved from college level indoctrination and was then fueled by the mainstream media after they began labelling President Trump and his supporters as “Nazis” or “fascists.” Through this, the “Harry Potter” dweebs decided to pickup bike-locks and go bashing their “enemies” over the head (*cough* *cough* Eric Clanton). It is supreme immaturity that leads to one galavanting around the streets under the collective title of Antifa.\n\nDespite Antifa’s ultimately noble on-paper philosophies, most of the people that congregate as “Antifa” are LARPers (“live action role-play”) attempting to find someone/thing to sexually interact with and the problem with this is the fact that bravado, especially from some of their “women” (God help them), manifests in the form of physical violence as a way to show off. Most of these people have not left their dorm rooms or their parents’ homes before, the shock of sunlight and the atmosphere messes with their minds.\n\nPrimarily comprised of white, pale-skinned, stick-thin men, and obese pimple-ridden women, Antifa hide behind masks to both disguise their grotesque appearances and to feel “united” with the others in their group. Their primary interests revolve around devolving the state and working outside of the parameters of our democratic and capitalistic system. When they do work within our system, they will attempt to apply “anarcho-syndicalism”, a view that appropriates industrial unionism as a way for the workers of a democratic/capitalistic society to seize control of the means of production in an effort to influence and control the society at large. They champion Marxism and believe that, through the implementation of Communism, they will have more individual control than under capitalism (a hilariously naïve belief).\n\nCommunism claimed the lives of around ninety-four million people in the 20th Century and young boys and girls across the country (and in other parts of the world, of course) experiment with this drug and as the hyperbole will go, this drug is a killer like any other. From Twitter bios to Instagram posts, you can see the hammer and sickle next to the “black flag” emoji and a conveniently placed “#BLM” beside the two and more often than not, it is some college-aged member of the bourgeoisie with a guilt complex and crippling daddy issues – it is all a game to them and a trend to follow not unlike the champagne socialists before them.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/antifa-leader-november-4th-millions-antifa-supersoldiers-will-behead-white-parents/","1509388456.0"

"Watch Donald Trump Handshake Rejected By Polish First Lady In Hilariously Awkward Exchange\nUpdate, 2:25 p.m. EDT—An extended video of the encounter during which President Donald Trump reaches out his arm to the first lady of Poland shows Agata Kornhauser-Duda eventually shaking the president’s hand, after initially passing him by in favor of greeting first lady Melania Trump. The mildly awkward and humorously relatable exchange was just that, and no apparent swipe at the U.S. president. Trump also shook German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s hand on Thursday afternoon, after months of anticipation following their White House meeting, when Trump did not take up Merkel's offer to shake hands in front of the cameras.\n\nPresident Donald Trump just can’t seem to catch a break—or a handshake, for that matter.\n\nThe commander in chief was attending a ceremony with first lady Melania Trump in Poland Thursday afternoon, accompanied by President Andrzej Duda and his wife, Agata Kornhauser-Duda. Like any other political soiree, the time came for a beautiful photo op during which the leaders would shake hands with each other and their wives, reinforcing their nations’ alliances on a world stage in a tangible and historically documented exchange.\n\nRelated: What are Donald, Melania and Ivanka Trump doing in Poland?\n\nBut of course, we’re talking about the Trumps, whose awkward physical interactions during their first trip abroad since assuming the White House were the focus of front-page internet news. On Thursday, the world was once again blessed with an unusual, albeit hilarious, apparent slight, this time involving Trump and the first lady of Poland.\n\nVideos of the moment show both first families walking on stage to perform their official greetings in front of the media, as Trump claps and appears to showcase his wife Melania Trump. Unlike the American president and his wife, Duda holds hands with his wife as the two walk out to accompany the Trumps.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe two leaders shake hands, with Trump leaning in and patting the Polish president on his right shoulder. Trump then leans further, toward Duda's wife, extending his arm for a handshake with the first lady. Instead, she glides past him, walking toward Melania Trump and reaching out to embrace her instead of the U.S. president.\n\nThe exchange immediately went viral, as viewers wrote that Trump was 'owned' by the Polish first lady.\n\nThis certainly isn’t the first time the president’s handshakes—or lack thereof—caused global reactions online and in the media.\n\nTrump’s white-knuckled shake with French President Emmanuel Macron was seen as a possible power-play, and the two once again exchanged an uncomfortable greeting during May’s G7 summit in Sicily. The president also was publicly ignored by Melania Trump after deplaning in Israel during their first international trip, as the first lady seemingly smacked Trump’s hands away from her as the two walked on the tarmac.\n\nTrump appears disgruntled immediately after being either ignored or unseen by Kornhauser-Duda, staring blankly past her and Melania and toward a camera observing the entire moment.\n\nMeanwhile, there's already talk of what the handshake between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will look like Friday, when the two meet for the first time during the G20 forum in Germany.\n\n'[I expect] an Olympian level of macho posturing between these two leaders, who both understand the importance of symbolism and the perception of being tough,” Derek Chollet, a former senior national security official in President Barack Obama’s administration, told CNN.\n\nThen again, as Thursday showed, Trump may very well not receive a handshake at all. And that would likely make Trump very angry.","http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-handshake-poland-president-wife-melania-trump-smack-video-watch-632808/","1499355121.0"
"JUST IN: John McCain Is NO LONGER A SENATOR\nTrump Makes His Move Against John McCain. IT’S ABOUT TIME!\n\nFive and a half years after Senator John McCain killed off what was left of The Maverick — the independent-thinking, “not afraid to tell it like it is” character he’d been LARPing since the 2000 Republican primary — in order to win a contentious primary against Tea Party challenger J.D. Hayworth, he’s facing the prospect of the end of his career once again.\n\nThis time, it’s against a state senator who’s perfectly content with grifting votes at a Donald Trump rally. McCain’s seat has been targeted by conservative groups for years now to no avail, but this time, it’s a fair question to ask if McCain’s heart is in it anymore. And even if it is: Does anyone even care?\n\nMcCain went from being the leader of the party in 2008 to the poster boy for RINOism almost immediately after, and the right wing was emboldened by his loss to blame his — and later, Mitt Romney’s — perceived lack of conservatism for the party’s failure to keep Barack Obama out of the White House. Over the past couple of years he’s been at the forefront of a very public argument with ultraconservatives like Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul for control of the party, and McCain’s tendency to work with Democrats on a few different issues have made him the right wing’s biggest internal enemy.\n\nEven McCain’s military career has, however cynically, come into question of late. Back in July, Donald Trump insulted John McCain by saying he “liked people who weren’t captured,” a reference to McCain being a prisoner of war for five-and-a-half years in Vietnam. Bill Kristol swore that this would eventually kill Trump’s insurgent campaign, and the political press questioned whether or not Trump had finally gone too far. Five months later, he’s still here, and still dominating in the polls.\n\nNot leading the polling for president, coincidentally, is Senator Lindsey Graham, whom McCain endorsed to run essentially the same campaign he did in 2008. Graham, a foreign policy hawk who has shown a willingness to compromise with Democrats on issues such as climate change and immigration, didn’t participate in a single one of the main GOP debates, and polled with a quarter of the support that Mike Huckabee has before dropping out of the race in mid-December.\n\nGraham, who’s been embraced as One of the Good Republicans in this primary despite his propensity to want perpetual war with multiple countries at a time, took a shot at a few of the frontrunners in the race in his farewell video, claiming his campaign made “enormous progress” in fighting the “isolationist” wing of his party. Given that Graham essentially ran a campaign that was the spiritual successor to McCain’s two runs — he was the only Republican to slam Trump from the start — this is a round rebuke of that brand of conservatism.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://usnewshouse.com/just-john-mccain-no-longer-senator/","1499901160.0"
"NASA Has Just Confirmed Earth Has A New Moon\n26.6k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nIt turns out that our moon isn’t alone out there, orbiting our planet on its own. Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.\n\nAccording to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.\n\nThe new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.\n\nThe smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon’s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet’s ‘original’ moon.\n\nThe ‘new’ moon is tilted at around 8° and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.\n\nThe orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.\n\nEarth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth’s smaller moon for coming centuries.\n\nThe new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.\n\n“Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,” said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “One other asteroid — 2003 YN107 — followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.\n\nThis new asteroid is much more locked onto us.

"Late Night Raid On Michigan Mosque Nets 11 ISIS Terrorists and More Than 40 Vests\nA mosque in a small town outside of Dearborn, Michigan has been raided by a joint task force from the FBI, Homeland Security and the ATF. According to preliminary reports from the scene, which is closed off for more than a mile, 11 “very dangerous men” who aren’t supposed to be in America at all have been apprehended plotting what would have been our next 9-11.\n\nAgent Nesmith Variacles of the FBI explains:\n\n“We found more than 40 suicide vests that would have killed anyone in a 300 foot radius. That’s basically a football field. These bombs were high-tech, plastic and non-detectable. They could have blown up 40 malls, sports venues, buildings…whatever they wanted. The good news is, they were a week out and we caught them.”\n\nThe mosque was actively recruiting American teenage Muslims to help carry out its plan to murder “as many as 100K infidels.” That number means either a mass attack spread across the country or a major sports venue going down with all 40 vests going off in tandem. The Department of Refugee Affairs seems to think it would have been the latter:\n\n“We believe they would have hit a football game next weekend, probably the Patriots in Foxboro. A liberal state is more likely to overlook a bunch of brown-skinned guys in overstuffed coats on a frigid Massachusetts night than they are to gove them a hard time. Especially if the vests don’t set off metal detectors.

People With Money reports on Thursday (August 17) that Obama is the highest-paid heir in the world, pulling in an astonishing $96 million between July 2016 and July 2017, a nearly $60 million lead over her closest competition.\n\nPeople With Money’s factors\n\nIn compiling this yearly list, the magazine considers factors such as upfront pay, profit participation, residuals, endorsements and advertising work.\n\nThe American heir has an estimated net worth of $275 million.

"UPDATED: Seattle Police Begin NAZI STYLE Gun Confiscation: No Laws Broken, No Warrant, No Charges\nEditor’s note: Upon further investigation, we have discovered that some of the information in this article is incorrect. We apologize for the errors.\n\nA Seattle man did have his pistol confiscated by police this month through an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO). That order IS a warrant, reports The Weekly Standard.\n\nHere’s more information, from KOMO News:\n\nThe incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side. Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him. The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or “erpo” – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. In this case, the man refused to comply. Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.\n\nOriginal article\n\nA man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws. The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil.\n\nThis sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.\n\nThe new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they’ve just begun the confiscation. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges. The man was not identified by authorities.\n\nNeighbors complained that the man had been “staring” at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. He was not brandishing his weapon by any account, and open carrying is legal in the area, so he was abiding by the law. Other residents also complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe.”\n\n“He was roaming the hallways with a .25 caliber automatic,” said Tony Montana, a man who lives in the same apartment complex as the gun owner and a person without any reasonable gun knowledge. Handguns are semi-automatic.\n\nThese lousy complaints from neighbors allowed police to use the newly passed state law to confiscate the man’s firearm because the man apparently stared at others. Maybe there’s a ban on staring at others in Washington we are unaware of. Under the extreme risk protection orders — also referred to as “erpos” or “red flag laws” — police (government officials) are now allowed to violate a person’s Second and Fourth Amendment rights (which are basic fundamental human rights) and take their legally acquired personal property if they are tattled on by offended liberals.\n\nTyranny has now taken hold on American soil.","http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/seattle-police-begin-nazi-style-gun-confiscation-no-laws-broken-no-warrant-no-charges_03062018/","1520355633.0"
"Mohammed Is Most Popular Name For Newborn Boys . . . In The Netherlands\nThe mainstream media in the Netherlands reported last week that 'Noah' was the most popular baby name for boys in the small European nation.\n\n'Noah and Emma were the most popular children's names in the past year,' reported Nos.nl. 'This is evident from the annual list of names of the Social Insurance Bank, which pays out the child benefit. Boys were named Noah 635 times, while 755 girls went through life as Emma since last year.' The year before, 'Daan' and 'Anna' were the most popular names, the site said.\n\nBut a journalist at Powned.tv did a little research on the report and found something completely different. Checking for 'Mohammed' — and all its alternative spellings — the writer found that 636 babies had been given that name last year.\n\n'Mohammed (221 times) and all possible conjugations like Mohamed (211 times), Muhammed (110 times), Mohammad (51 times), Muhammad (43 times), Mohamad (unknown), Muhamed (unknown), Muhammet (not known), Mouhamed (not known), Muhamad (not known), Mahamuud (not known),' wrote the reporter.\n\nThe 636 variants of the name put it one ahead of 'Noah.' That makes 'Mohammed' and its alternate spellings the most popular name in the Netherlands for the second straight year. In 2016, '724 boys received the name (or one of the conjugations) from their parents,' the site reported.\n\nAnd then there was this:\n\n'By the way, how do you think about the statistics in Great Britain and Wales? The British claim that Oliver is the name given most to newborn boys . In reality, this is ... Right, Mohammed or one of his conjugations,' the reporter wrote, citing this article.\n\nThe UK’s national statistics office recently released the latest data on baby names in England and Wales. It says the following: “Oliver remains as the most popular first name given to baby boys in England and Wales in 2016.” But that’s not really true. In fact, the most common name by far is Muhammad.\n\nSo apparently you can't trust the mainstream media in the Netherlands, either.","https://www.dailywire.com/news/25875/mohammed-most-popular-name-newborn-boys-joseph-curl?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=062316-news&amp;utm_campaign=benshapiro/","1516034340.0"

"Remains of Nazi Officer Discovered inside 100-Year Old Giant Catfish\nKrosno Odrzańskie| A pair of Polish fisherman made an amazing discovery when they opened the belly of the 410-pound catfish they had just caught in the Oder river.\n\nThe stomach of the monstrous fish contained fragments of human bones, as well as German military artifacts dating back to the Second World War.\n\nAlfons Brzozowski and Marek Zdanowicz were fishing near the Oder’s confluence with the Bóbr river on April 6, when they made an astonishing catch: a gigantic Wels catfish, measuring 12 feet (3.68 meters) and weighing 413 pounds (187.5 kg).\n\nTheir celebration was rapidly transformed into interrogation, and then disgust, when they opened the animal’s belly. Among a large quantity of half-digested fish, they discovered an old metal insignia dating back to Nazi Germany, as well dozens of human bone fragments.\n\nThe two fishermen rapidly contacted the police, who opened an investigation to determine the origin of the remains.\n\nThe examination of the bones enabled the authorities to determine that they belonged to a Caucasian man in his early twenties, who died many decades ago.\n\nThe biologists who examined the fish, for their part, confirmed that the enormous specimen was probably aged between 90 and 110 years old, making it one of the oldest catfish specimens ever found.\n\nFurther analysis of the artifacts and the bones have revealed that they had indeed been ingested by the fish during the 1940s, and were very likely the remains of a German SS officer, killed during the occupation of Poland.\n\nThe team of forensic experts who proceeded to the tests, could not determine, however, if the man was actually killed by the catfish or if he was already dead when he was eaten by the animal.\n\n“We have only a few fragments of bones, and much of the skeleton is missing” says Dr. Patek Lojko. “We don’t have enough evidence to determine the cause of death, but we are almost certain that the bones are those of a German SS officer. We found a SS hat eagle, as well as two buttons and a cufflink from the same uniform. Unfortunately, many bones and artifacts seem to have been “evacuated” naturally by the fish over the years and the DNA in the bones was damaged by the gastric juices, so a formal identification is impossible for the moment.”\n\nThe Wels catfish is a large fish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe.\n\nWith a possible total length up to 4 m (13 ft) and a maximum weight of over 400 kg (880 lb), it is the second largest freshwater fish in the region after the beluga sturgeon.\n\nIndividuals of this species have been observed lunging out of the water to grab pigeons, ducks, rats, cats and even dogs, on land.\n\nExceptionally large specimens have even been rumored to attack humans in rare instances, but this is the first time that human remains are actually found inside one of these fishes.\n\nA report in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard on 5 August 2009, mentions such a catfish dragging a fisherman near Győr, in Hungary, under water.\n\nThe fish allegedly caught the man by his right leg after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold. The man barely escaped with his life, from a fish which must have weighed over 100 kg (220 lb), according to the fisherman.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/remains-of-nazi-officer-discovered-inside-100-year-old-giant-catfish/","1428677861.0"

"A Russian Writer Claiming To Be Putin’s Lover Found Dead In His Swiss Apartment\nWriter, Louri Michaelevitch, a former personnal assistant of the Russian President, was found dead last monday in his swiss appartment after some of the neighbors complained about the smell emanating from the residence.\n\nAccording to the city’s police departmnent, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot.\n\n“The police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination team” explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department.”We can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.”\n\nThe victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “Я был любовник Путина” (“I was Putin’s Lover“), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand of political asylum from the helvetic state.\n\nMany sources also claim that Mr Michaelevitch had dinner with an attaché of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999.","http://howafrica.com/a-russian-writer-claiming-to-be-putins-lover-found-dead-in-his-swiss-apartment/","1492507677.0"
"Naked Malia Obama And Boyfriend BUSTED While Streaking On Harvard Campus\nMalia Obama has gotten herself into trouble yet again after a stupid “Thirsty Thursday” night stunt. Every week, college students drink themselves into oblivion the day before the last day of classes for the week, and Malia Obama — who is under the legal drinking age of 21 — is no different.\n\nApparently, the elder Obama daughter had a bit too much to drink and, according to Harvard Campus Safety, took a “dare” from her friends to streak across a parking lot with her boyfriend.

Malia Obama, 19, and Dmitri Noonan, 24, were seen holding hands and running through the parking lot while yelling what appeared to be “how you like me now [expletive deleted].” The pair will be charged with public indecency, fined $500 each by the school, and placed on academic probation for the remainder of the semester. Another offense could lead to expulsion.\n\nThis is not Malia Obama’s first time embarrassing her embarrassment of a family this year. Earlier in the school year, she was caught smoking pot in her dorm and was busted at a party that was broken up by the police just two weeks ago.\n\nMalia Obama is a trainwreck of a human being, and she should be ashamed for acting like such an uncivilized tramp.\n\nThey should throw her in jail where her whole family belongs.

While everyone thought terrorism was to blame, we correctly pointed out that large power failures in major US cities was due to an intense geomagnetic storm registering 8-10 on K-Planetary Index.\n\nEarthsky.org provides an easy understanding of what is a cornoal mass ejection…\n\nBack to the exercise on November 04-06, the US Department of Defense headquarters entity will work with the US Army and US Air-Force MARS organizations and the Amateur Radio community to request status reports for 3,143 US counties.

President Donald Trump had the ideal answer for the issue forced by outsiders, however Democrats didn’t bolster him. You won’t think about what occurred next…\n\nBarack Obama urged Muslims to request their rights. Muslims were informed that America is an astonishing nation loaded with potential outcomes. All things considered, it wasn’t some time before settlers set particular prerequisites. Some of these individuals do have issues, and need genuine help. Be that as it may, the vast majority of them are simply crossing the US outskirt to appreciate greatest advantages.\n\nPresident Trump realized this would transform into a difficult issue, and recommended that our nation bars foreigners from a few Muslim dominant part nations. Tragically, the travel boycott was blocked comfortable start, and Muslim outsiders attacked the nation.\n\nAmerica resembles a strong and minding host, however some of its guests are accompanying lethal thoughts in their psyche. They are continually requesting more. This time Muslim settlers made a particular request, and it includes sustenance served in schools.\n\nMuslim outsiders in Chevigny-Saint-Sauveur are attempting to adjust the lunch menu in schools. Their arrangement didn’t work, so now they are proposing that schools offer “option lunch menus” that wo exclude any pork. Be that as it may, Mayor Michel Rotger stood up to them.\n\nThe leader prohibited such menus to spare nearby government cash. As indicated by Rotger, elective menus dependably prompt waste. “We are setting up an operation so the youngsters eat everything and their eating regimens are adjusted. There is excessively squander so we will show them to eat meat, be it poultry or pork,” clarified Mayor Rotger.\n\nLiberals didn’t reconsider before assaulting the leader. Paul Garrigue disliked Rotger’s choice. Garrigue is the leader of a gathering comprised of Amnesty International, the League of Human Rights, and different affiliations.\n\n“Today, we are discussing secularism in a by and large hostile to Muslim way. We consider secularism to be a device of resilience and living respectively and not rejection,” Garrigue said.\n\nWhat do you think about making elective menus? Will Muslims continue with their requests?","http://allnews4us.com/politics/muslims-demand-pork-free-menus/","1498868807.0"
"CIA Agent Confesses On Deathbed: 'We Blew Up WTC 7 On 9\n79-year-old retired CIA agent, Malcom Howard, has made a series of astonishing claims since being released from hospital in New Jersey on Friday and told he has weeks to live. Mr. Howard claims he was involved in the “controlled demolition” of World Trade Center 7, the third building that was destroyed on 9/11.\n\nMr. Howard, who worked for the CIA for 36 years as an operative, claims he was tapped by senior CIA agents to work on the project due to his engineering background, and early career in the demolition business.\n\nTrained as a civil engineer, Mr. Howard became an explosives expert after being headhunted by the CIA in early 1980s. Mr. Howard says has extensive experience in planting explosives in items as small as cigarette lighters and as large as “80 floor buildings.”\n\nThe 79-year-old New Jersey native says he worked on the CIA operation they dubbed “New Century” between May 1997 and September 2001, during a time he says the CIA “was still taking orders from the top.” Mr. Howard says he was part of a cell of 4 operatives tasked with ensuring the demolition was successful.\n\nMr. Howard says the World Trade Center 7 operation is unique among his demolitions, as it is the only demolition that “we had to pretend wasn’t a demolition job”. He claims he had no problem going through with the deception at the time, because “when you are a patriot, you don’t question the motivation of the CIA or the White House. You assume the bigger purpose is for a greater good. They pick good, loyal people like me, and it breaks my heart to hear the shit talk.”\n\n[John Kerry Admits WTC 7 Was Brought Down By Controlled Demolition]\n\nBut even he admits that now, looking back, “Something wasn’t right.”\n\n“No good has come from this. This isn’t the America we envisioned.”\n\nExplaining how the building was bought down, Mr. Howard says, “It was a classic controlled demolition with explosives. We used super-fine military grade nanothermite composite materials as explosives. The hard part was getting thousands of pounds of explosives, fuses and ignition mechanisms into the building without causing too much concern. But almost every single office in the Building 7 was rented by the CIA, the Secret Service, or the military, which made it easier.”\n\nMr. Howard explains that WTC 7 was “loaded with explosives in strategic places” in the month leading up to the day that changed the course of American history. On September 11th, while the North and South towers burned, fuses were ignited in World Trade Center 7, and nanothermite explosions hollowed out the building, destroying the steel structure, removing the reinforcements, and allowing the office fires to tear through the rest of the building, hollowing it out like a shell.\n\nWorld Trade Center 7 collapsed into its own footprint at 5:20pm, seven hours after the destruction of WTC 1 and 2. The building shocked witnesses by coming down at the speed of freefall, indicating that it encountered zero resistance on the way down.\n\nMr. Howard and his colleagues had done their job.\n\n“When the building came down, it was such a rush. Everything went exactly to plan. It was so smooth. Everybody was evacuated. Nobody was hurt in WTC 7. We were celebrating. We kept watching replays of the demolition, we had the whiskey and cigars out, and then all of a sudden the strangest thing happened. We all started to worry that it looked a bit too smooth. We watched the tape again and again and again and we started to get paranoid. It looked like a controlled demolition. We thought shit, people are going to question this. And then we heard that people from the street were reporting that they heard the explosions during the afternoon. When we were told that the BBC botched their report and announced to the world that the building collapsed 20 minutes before it actually did… At that point we really thought the gig was up.”\n\nAccording to the official 9/11 report issued by the government, WTC 7 collapsed due to “uncontrolled fires” that were caused by debris that floated over from WTC 1 and 2, which had been hit by passenger planes. If the official narrative was true, WTC 7 would be the first tall building in the world to ever collapse due to uncontrolled fires, and the only steel skyscraper in the world to have collapsed into itself, due to “office fires.”\n\nMr. Howard and his colleagues feared the public would see through the official narrative and rise up against the government, demanding to be told the truth.\n\n“There were so many loose ends, so much evidence left behind. We thought the public would be all over it. We thought there would be a public uprising that the media couldn’t ignore. They’d be funding investigations and demanding to know why they were being lied to. We thought they’d find chemical composites in the area that would prove Building 7 was blown up.\n\n“We thought there would be a revolution. It would go all the way to the top, to President Bush. He’d be dragged out of the White House.\n\n“But none of that happened. Almost nobody questioned anything. The media shot down anyone who dared question anything they were told.”\n\nFollow the money\n\nMr. Howard claims he has “no direct knowledge” about the destruction of North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, explaining that “CIA operations are very specific” and that it is common to be working on a larger project while only understanding a small piece of the puzzle.\n\n[9/11: Larry Silverstein Designed New WTC-7 One Year Before Attacks]\n\nBut he has advice for investigators seeking to understand the entire puzzle and work out who was behind the most devastating attack on American soil in history.\n\n“Follow the money.”\n\n“When you want to find out who is behind something, just follow the money. Look at the trades made just before 9/11. These are the guys that knew what was coming. The sons of CIA agents, government officials. Close relatives of the most powerful men in America. Cheney, Rumsfeld. They all got rich. It wasn’t just the contracts awarded to their friends in the construction business and the wars and the kickbacks.”\n\n“It was insider trading.”\n\nMany countries including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Monaco launched insider trading investigations in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, believing that if they could prove Al-Qaeda operatives profited on the stock market then they could prove the terror organization was behind the attacks.\n\nAnd all the evidence pointed to heavy insider trading around 9/11.\n\nItaly’s foreign minister, Antonio Martino, said: “I think that there are terrorist states and organizations behind speculation on the international markets.” German central bank president, Ernst Welteke, said his researchers had found “almost irrefutable proof of insider trading.”\n\nEven CNN reported that regulators were seeing “ever-clearer signs” that someone “manipulated financial markets ahead of the terror attack in the hope of profiting from it.”\n\nMr. Howard says that a serious study of who profited on the stock market from 9/11 would “tear the heart out of the oligarchy in America.”\n\n“There is only one organization that spans the entire world, and let me tell you now, it isn’t and it never was al-Qaeda.”\n\nIt’s the CIA.\n\n“There could never be a real investigation. The entire shadow government, as you call them now, are implicated.”\n\nThe 79-year-old, spending his final weeks at home, said he doesn’t expect to be taken into custody following his confession because “then they’d have to go after everyone else. They will just use the media to attack me. They are all on the payroll to suppress everything around 9/11.”","http://yournewswire.com/cia-911-wtc7/","1499960135.0"
"Playing Christmas Music Before Thanksgiving Now A Federal Crime\nU.S.—It’s easy to focus on everything going wrong with our country, so much so that we often don’t stop to take a minute and be thankful for the good things our leaders accomplish from time to time.\n\nTake the most recent legislation passed by Congress, for instance: as of Tuesday, it is now a federal crime to play Christmas music before Thanksgiving.\n\nAny storefront, home, or radio station playing songs like “Baby It’s Cold Outside,” “Rockin Around the Christmas Tree,” or “Last Christmas” is subject to immediate search by federal authorities, who have been instructed to arrest the perpetrator onsite and bring him or her to a secret CIA facility for questioning. Upon conviction, the suspect is subject to up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nThe move passed the House with a historic unanimous vote of 435-0, skated through the Senate with another unprecedented vote of 100-0, and finally was signed into law in the very same day by President Trump.\n\n“At long last, we can all unite around our hatred for being forced to listen to sappy Christmas standards months before December 25,” a Congressional representative said. “While we may all disagree on just about every other social issue of our day, at least we can come together on this.”\n\nIt’s great that our country can finally agree on something during these tumultuous times!","http://babylonbee.com/news/playing-christmas-music-thanksgiving-now-federal-crime/","1510072110.0"
"Trump Just Told George Soros To ‘Go To Hell’ Right To His Face\nDuring this photo-op at Davos, Switzerland, where the world’s financial elite were meeting to thrash out plans for the future, President Trump couldn’t help letting slip his real feelings about billionaire George Soros.\n\nA female reporter with a German accent asked President Trump, who had just taken his seat, “Why are you smiling so broadly, like the cat that got the cream?“\n\nBefore President Trump could answer, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, seated on the far left in the photo, said, “He is smiling because he just told George Soros to go to hell.”\n\nMainstream media from around the world reported on George Soros’ speech at Davos, which he dedicated entirely to criticizing President Trump. Attempting to convince the world that Trump’s presidency is “a danger to the world.“\n\nAccording to the notorious globalist billionaire, the survival of humanity depends on Trump being impeached in the next twelve months. “Not only the survival of Open Society but the survival of our entire civilization is at stake,” said Soros.\n\nGeorge Soros says the Trump administration is a “danger to the world” https://t.co/27DgMD3HX7 pic.twitter.com/h5zqn3xC6B — Bloomberg (@business) January 25, 2018\n\nBut Soros’s speech didn’t go down well at Davos. Expecting the audience to be on his side, Soros was dismayed when he was ignored and President Trump received something close to a hero’s welcome, according to the New York Post. Even the Washington Post was unable to spin the event into a negative Trump story, admitting that the president managed to “win” at Davos.\n\nAnd the reason is simple: It’s hard to argue with success.\n\nSustained economic growth (a much improved 2.6 percent GDP for the fourth quarter — and that’s before the epic tax cuts kick in), signs of higher wage growth (many companies are now handing out bonus checks to workers for the first time since 2007) and a roaring stock market (with the Dow heading close to 30,000) are cold, hard facts that cannot be argued with.\n\nEven people who claim to despise Trump are finding a silver lining in the orange-tinted cloud.\n\nThis is all bad news for Soros, the octogenarian billionaire who recently pumped $18 billion into leftist causes around the world. While much of the money Soros spends through his Open Society Foundation has gone to destabilizing democracy in Eastern Europe and more recently to crashing economies and devastating developing nations around the globe, he has now shifted his focus, he said, and will spend much of his money taking on President Trump directly in America.\n\nWas Soros surprised by the muted response to his speech at Davos?\n\nThe fact Soros attempted to gain a coveted one-on-one meeting with Trump after delivering such a negative speech should come as no surprise. This is the man who claims he is a God, and that “normal rules do not apply” to him.\n\nPresident Trump’s sharp words to George Soros were all that he deserved.\n\nIn contrast to Soros’s dismal speech, Trump’s speech went down a storm. Informing the audience that Washington “will no longer turn a blind eye” to predatory trade policies of other countries, he also made a point to note, “America first does not mean America alone. When the United States grows, so does the world.”\n\nBesides George Soros, who could possibly argue with that?","http://yournewswire.com/trump-george-soros-hell/","1517244497.0"
"Trump Organization Wins Lucrative Contract To Rebuild Syrian Airport\nDonald Trump Jr, eldest son of the President and trustee of his business empire, has announced that the Trump Organization has won a lucrative contract to refurbish an airport in the Middle East. He was quick to emphasize this was done without the involvement of the White House.\n\n“I can state with one-hundred percent certainty that my father played no role in the negotiation of this contract which was conducted solely by me over the past 24 hours.”\n\nThe airport, called the Shayrat airbase near the Syrian city of Homs, primarily plays host to a domestic carrier called the 50th Air Brigade. Though still a functioning airport, a number of buildings had fallen into disrepair over the course of the past 72 hours.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. said there were a number of other developers bidding on the project, but he managed to persuade client Bashar al-Assad to pick him by promising to stand behind his work.\n\n“I told him if I rebuild it I can guarantee it will be quality that will stand the test of time. But if it’s someone other than the Trump Organization, who knows? I couldn’t say what might happen to it.”\n\nThough building airports is a new departure for the Trump Organization – which is more known for hotels and casinos – fellow Trustee Eric Trump sees a lot more variety in the company’s future.\n\n\n\n“I see us rebuilding many more airports, as well as heavy manufacturing facilities, power stations, and maybe even ship-building yards.

"Justin Bieber: Pedophiles Run The ‘Evil’ Music Industry\nJustin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has “woken up” to the “evils of the music industry” and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is “controlled by the absolute worst kind of people – pedophiles.”\n\nBieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a “horrific story” with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour.\n\nDescribing a party on tour – attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers – Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite.\n\n“I didn’t want to do this. I really didn’t. They said this kid was drugged, it was horrible,” Bieber said, explaining that it was made clear to him that he would gain entry to the “business side of the industry” if he “joined the club” by passing the initiation rites.\n\n“I wouldn’t just be a performer, I’d be a mogul. That path would open up for me, like it did for Jay-Z.”\n\n“It’s the difference between being a millionaire and being a billionaire.”\n\nBut Bieber told the congregation that he couldn’t do it.\n\n“To join the club I’d have to do bad things to this poor kid. But then I realized that even that wasn’t enough for them. I’d also have to kill this little child.”\n\nBieber said he had heard rumors about this type of initiation in the music industry, but he had not been confronted with it before.\n\n“I got told they secretly film these parties. Once they’ve got you on video doing something like that, they own you.”\n\nBieber said his conscience is clear because he didn’t participate, but the fate of the drugged child is haunting him.\n\n“They said this kid was raped by a few different guys. They said he was bleeding. I got out of there but I heard he died and that haunts me.”\n\nThis allegation from Justin Bieber adds to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.\n\nAccording to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”\n\nIf you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood and music industry system.\n\nIn recent months Nicole Kidman and Lindsay Lohan also spoke out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.\n\nJustin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry.

"QUEEN ELIZABETH REMOVES OBAMAS FROM ROYAL WEDDING GUEST LIST\nQueen Elizabeth has personally removed Michelle and Barack Obama from the guest list for Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, according to British reports.\n\nInvitations to Royal weddings in England have traditionally been extended to the sitting President of the United States and the current First Lady, so when Queen Elizabeth saw what Michelle Obama was up to – trying to sneak a spot at the wedding at the expense of the real POTUS and FLOTUS – she delivered Michelle a well-deserved and humiliating beatdown.\n\nWhile Barack Obama has been traveling around the world, operating as some kind of shadow president and attempting to undermine the real POTUS, Michelle has been trying to push her way into every major social event where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.\n\nWhen Michelle Obama heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her rightful place to be on that guest list. Michelle made a desperate move to sneak a spot on the guest list, but unfortunately for the former First Lady, the guest list has to be approved by the Queen of England herself.\n\nTimeline of Queen Elizabeth’s brutal Obama smackdown\n\nAs soon as Buckingham Palace announced the news that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were officially engaged, the opportunistic Obamas saw their chance to edge their way into the elites, like a couple of desperate kids trying to hang with the popular crowd at school. Barack immediately got on social media to beat President Trump to the congratulatory punch. Barack has a lot more time on his hands than the current POTUS who is cleaning up the mess he left behind.\n\nBarack, who had been practically stalking Prince Harry on Twitter in recent weeks, made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which served the purpose of letting the Royals know that he and Michelle were angling for an invitation to the wedding of the year.\n\nThe Obamas are experts at playing the crowd for fools, and Barack’s sycophantic post got a whopping one million likes. The Obamas were likely over the moon about this return on their cynical investment, because it meant Prince Harry and the Royal Family were likely to see it and a seat at the high table was surely theirs for the taking.\n\nThe exposure of Barack’s post sparked rumors that the Obamas would likely be added to the guest list at the expense of the current president and first lady, London’s Independent reported. But while Barack was busy sending desperate tweets and DMs to secretly get on the coveted guest list, Michelle was doing something worse to shove the Trumps aside and ensure her spot, even though the honor is traditionally reserved for the current president and first lady.\n\nMichelle has been doing the rounds on the speaking tour lately, trying to rack in hundreds of thousands of dollars and trash Trump at the same time. Her recent trip to Canada was no exception. She combined her usual trash talk with the hidden goal of getting to the historic royal wedding.\n\nAddressing the “Economic Club of Toronto,” Michelle deviated from her usual Trump bashing shtick and went into overdrive, kissing up to the Queen of England at every opportunity, and criticizing POTUS Trump whenever possible. Michelle really wanted that wedding invite.\n\nAccording to Page Six, Michelle took the opportunity to make fun of President Trump then immediately gushed over the queen. Both conversation deviations had no place in an event like this, but for calculated Michelle, it has a passive-aggressive purpose of saying that Trump wasn’t fit for her guest list, but since she loves the Queen so much, she should get a spot.\n\n“After being introduced by Canada’s first lady, Sophie Trudeau, Obama told the crowd that it is ‘never a good idea’ to put your first thought in the morning on social media, and never a good idea to ‘tweet from bed,’ which appears to be one of the president’s favorite pastimes, presuming that he is actually in bed when he tweets at 3 a.m,” Page Six reported.\n\n“Going on about effective communication, and the importance of doing drafts, Obama went on, ‘Then you need to edit and spell-check it.’ The 45-minute conversation, hosted by the Economic Club of Toronto, flowed into a bunch of amusing side stories, including her memories of being awestruck when meeting Queen Elizabeth of England.”\n\n“’What do you do with the Queen? I touched her. She touched me first,’ she said, adding that her dream dinner guest would be Jesus, whom she’d serve pizza.”\n\nIt’s well known that the respect, proper etiquette, and holding a high-level of decorum is important to the Royal Family and by painting a picture that Trump is an impetuous buffoon who can’t control himself, Michelle thought she was making him look like a bad person to have at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the bigger motive in her comments was to cover up her actual faux-pas with the Queen when, not surprisingly, brash Michelle showed a complete lack of respect and protocol when she got a little too touchy.\n\nThe moment she bullied her way into a hug and pushed the Queen toward a chair was the moment Queen Elizabeth decided there was to be no place for Michelle or Barack Obama at the wedding, The Guardian previously reported.\n\nThe Queen felt so grossly disrespected by Michelle that she royally snubbed the former first lady after the touchy-feely offense.\n\nWhen she flew into London with her mother and daughters in tow, expecting an audience with Queen Elizabeth, she received a big slap-in-the-face instead, the Globe reported. Instead of spending the day with Michelle and her family who flew in to meet with her, the Queen ditched her and went off the horse races instead.\n\nMichelle may think she’s royalty and even try to act like it, but she’s got nothing on the actual Queen of England who is the real deal and put her in her place. The Queen does what she wants and by kicking desperate Michelle Obama off the guest list, and extending an invitation to the real POTUS and FLOTUS instead, she showed she is no-one’s fool.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...","https://web.archive.org/web/http://america2day.info/2017/12/10/queen-elizabeth-removes-obamas-from-royal-wedding-guest-list/","1512882000.0"
"Fox News Sandra Smith: “Everybody Could See From The United Airlines Passenger’s Behavior That He Was Not A Genuine American”\nFox News host Sandra Smith on Wednesday linked a customer who was dragged off a United Airlines flight to government “overregulation” of the airline industry. During a Fox News discussion about the recent United Airlines public relations debacle, Smith noted that lawmakers were calling for an investigation and that the airline lost millions in stock value. “Airlines disgust me,” Fox News contributor Geraldo Rivera told Smith. “They do everything to maximize profit.” “There’s nothing wrong with maximizing profit,” Smith insisted. “That’s what they’re supposed to do as a publicly traded airline.” “But when you book and overbook,” Rivera replied, “paid passengers have to give up their seats. This is not business. This is reckless, foolhardy imposition of your own personal convenience – what happened to ‘the customer is always right’?”\n\nSmith continued, “But look, I get where you’re coming from with this, but at the end of the day, we’re talking here about an airline, a company that exists solely for the purpose of transporting passengers from one place in the country to another. If you just consider the fact that 15 or so years ago we had two airplanes crash into the World Trade Center in New York City, I think you’ll understand that they were right to be edgy. And that goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American. As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the video of what happened on the plane, it’s obvious that his behavior suggests that he’s from another part of the world, and that’s that.”\n\nRivera asked, “You can’t possibly be serious, Sandra? Are you actually saying that the company was right to, first, overbook the flight, and then secondly, call security to beat up the man simple because his behavior suggested he wasn’t a true American? And what does that even mean?” Again, Smith wouldn’t be confused. “Look Geraldo, at the end of the day, you have to understand the fact that the moment Americans see a non-white person sitting next to them on a plane, they get chills. Some of them get outright angry as well, and while that’s not ideal, it’s certainly understandable. We can’t blame people for fearing for their lives because of the terrible tragedy this country endured during 9/11.”\n\n“What’s more, I would even go so far as to say that the man had it coming for one simple reason. If that had been a white person, they would have likely stepped out of the plane and waited for the next flight, not to mention that they would probably also have been compensated for the inconvenience in some way or another. Instead, since this guy wasn’t white, his reaction was also different from that of a white person, which is why he refused to give up his seat. If he’d done that, everything would have gone more smoothly and without incident. This way, because he was stubborn, he ended up getting the short end of the stick. That’s just not how white people behave, and non-whites in this country need to learn that. We’re more civilized than the rest, which is why we’re at the top of the food chain. The guy had it coming, end of story,” she concluded.\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/04/14/fox-news-sandra-smith-everybody-see-united-airlines-passengers-behavior-not-genuine-american/","1492142400.0"

"Portland to Allow Furries to Defecate, Mate in City Dog Parks\nPORTLAND, Or. – Portland’s city council on Wednesday voted 3 to 1 in favor of the Equal Use Act, a new resolution granting individuals who identify as furries the same rights afforded to dogs and their respective owners who frequent popular off-leash areas and dog parks in the greater Portland area.\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of a four-day sit-in organized by PDX Furs, a regional furry community based in the Portland metro area, which staged the protest at Portland’s city council offices on Milwaukie Avenue last weekend. “This is a huge victory,” said Bo Kirkman. “Not just for furries here in Portland but furries living all across the United States.”\n\nBo, a former kindergarten teacher and self-described furry rights advocate, told the Portland Tribune that he identifies as a dog. “It’s one thing to say you can’t bring your cat or your ferret or whatever to the off-leash areas because obviously they’re not dogs. But if I want to go to the park and play with my owner, well as a canine, that should be my right.”\n\nNow, thanks to the City of Portland, Bo and his fellow furries can take advantage of the city’s designated off-leash areas. “Provided they respect and adhere to the posted rules and regulations at our city parks,” said Public Affairs commissioner Dan Saltzman who sits on the city council and voted in favor of the resolution.\n\nAccording to the City of Portland’s official website, dog park visitors are expected to pick up and dispose of their pet’s waste and are advised to leave sick animals at home. “In an effort to prevent the spread of disease, we ask that owners refrain from allowing their dogs – or furries – drink from standing water,” Saltzman said.\n\nHowever, not everyone is celebrating the new resolution.. “I think it’s rediculous,” said council-member Amanda Fritz who sits on the Portland Parks Board and voted against the proposal. “We’re allowing people in costumes to frolic about and fornicate to their heart’s content in our public parks.”\n\nMrs. Fritz may be alone in her sentiments. Portland mayor Charlie Hales told the Daily Journal of Commerce that the Equal Use Act is synonymous with Portland’s unofficial slogan. “Keep Portland weird,” quoted Mayor Hales before adding, “That is precisely what we intend to do.”","http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/05/portland-city-council-votes-to-allow-furries-to-defecate-mate-in-dog-parks/","1462370560.0"
"UN Official Found Dead After He Was Set To Testify In Clinton Corruption Case !\n33.2k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nOh the ‘coincidence!’ A former United Nations official has been found dead, assumed to have died due to a weight-lifting accident. All that sound’s perfectly fine, except with one little detail that makes the death a little suspicious: the official was linked to a corruption scandal that involved former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe U.N. official, John Ashe, has allegedly died from a barbell, but the timing of the ‘accident’ couldn’t be more perfect for conspiracy theorists to allege that this was no mere accident.\n\nAshe’s body was discovered on Wednesday in his house in Westchester county. The police reported that his suffered heavy injury on his throat, presumably by the barbell while he was working out.\n\nAshe was scheduled to appear in court on Monday with Chinese billionaire and Ashe’s co-defendant, David Ng Lap Seng, who is suspected of smiling $4.5 million in the United States as of 2013 and lied that the money would be used to buy art pieces and casino chips.\n\nReports say that the Chinese businessman was channeling money using a restaurant owner of Arkansas named Charlie Trie, to the Democratic National Committee during the Clinton administration, but he has never been prosecuted, till now.\n\nOne source said, “During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman David Ng Lap Seng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed.”\n\nSpot on comment. The timing of this influential official’s death couldn’t be more convenient for the Democrats. I guess we can say that we’ve found the secret the Clinton family has had for being able to escape prison for a long time: getting rid of all the suspects before any of them could reveal incriminating information about the god-knows-how-many criminal activities they’ve been involved in.\n\nWhat do you think about this?

"THIS ARTICLE RETRACTED: Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syria’s Douma\nUpdate:\n\nThe Syrian Arab Red Crescent statement was reported, and at the time we had no reason to believe it was not true. Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.\n\n—\n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.\n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.\n\n(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)\n\nChemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these “real” patients to confirm an attack.\n\nLast 5 posts by Jason Ditz","https://news.antiwar.com/2018/04/09/red-crescent-says-no-evidence-of-chemical-attack-in-syrias-douma/","1523246400.0"
"California Gov. Jerry Brown To Allow HIV Positive People To Donate Blood\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown is expected to give a green light to a bill allowing HIV positive people to knowingly expose their blood to others.\n\nThe bill, SB 239, will reduce the penalties for knowingly exposing someone to HIV without telling them, allowing HIV positive people to donate their blood to others. Lawmakers claim the current felony charge for the crime is ‘discriminatory.’\n\nFoxnews.com reports: State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who introduced the bill, said the current law discriminates against people with HIV because people who expose others with different viruses get only a misdemeanor rather than a felony.\n\n“Right now HIV is singled out for uniquely harsh treatment as a felony,” Wiener said during the floor debate, according to the L.A. Times. He added that modern drugs allow someone with HIV to be noninfectious to others, while the felony charge may discourage some from getting tested.\n\n“These laws do not prevent HIV infections. All they do is stigmatize people living with HIV and reduce access to testing and care.”\n\n“These laws do not prevent HIV infections.

"BREAKING: San Diego Declares EMERGENCY… 15 DEAD, 400 HOSPITALIZED\nDean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS–\n\nThe ultra liberal city of San Diego, California which incidentally is inundated with illegal aliens is facing a health crisis and authorities have declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.\n\nA public health emergency was declared Friday over an outbreak of ‘hepatitis A’ that has been linked to at least 15 deaths and 400 hospitalizations.\n\nThe liver disease outbreak started last November, with the homeless population affected most. The emergency declaration will help the city access state funds and provide legal protection for new sanitation measures, the Union-Tribune reported.\n\nAreas with high concentrations of homeless people will receive roughly 40 portable hand-washing stations to help combat the disease, which can spread through fecal matter when people fail to thoroughly clean their hands after using the restroom.\n\nCrews also plan to use bleach-spiked water for high-pressure washing to remove “all feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces,” according to a sanitation plan outlined in a letter Thursday.\n\nOther cities in the region can expect to see similar hand-washing and street-sanitizing efforts, said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the region’s public health officer, FOX News reported.\n\nAfter previous vaccination and educational programs failed to significantly reduce the infection rate, and with death reports spiking in recent weeks, San Diego decided to mimic a campaign used in Los Angeles, which is home to tens of thousands of homeless, in an attempt to curb the outbreak.\n\n“We know that L.A. has had no local cases of hepatitis A related to the strain that we’re seeing here in San Diego,” Wooten said. “If they’re doing it there and they haven’t had any cases, it could be beneficial here as well.”\n\nThe moves in San Diego follow finger-pointing between city and county officials, with both sides insisting they were doing the best they could under tough circumstances, the newspaper said.\n\n“There is no precedent for this,” Wooten said. “We will definitely have a playbook for if we have something like this in the future.

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.\n\nAccording to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.\n\nU.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.\n\nIn 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.","https://notallowedto.com/great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/","1466516497.0"
"BREAKING: Obama Divorce Rumor CONFIRMED–Here’s What We Know\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 4.5k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nLate last week, a rumor began circulating in Washington social circles that there was trouble in paradise for Barack and Michelle Obama. While there was no confirmation, it was being tossed around that it was Barack looking to dump Michelle. This morning, a filing in the District Court of Cook County, Illinois confirmed that the couple is seeking divorce and that Barack is, in fact, the plaintiff.\n\nAccording to county docket D4610968L86, Barack Hussein Obama seeks dissolution of marriage from Michelle Obama on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable differences. The infidelity, according to the Obama’s longtime housekeeper, Analita Consuelo Gonsales, isn’t recent but rather the revelation through a recent DNA test that Obama isn’t the biological father of Sasha or Malia.\n\nGonsales said that it wasn’t really a surprise, because during an argument in 2003 Barack admitted to Michelle that he had faked all of his orgasms. Michelle, in turn, admitted that she had an affair with a biolab and that the children were actually the product of advanced genetic engineering. Apparently, Malia is secretly one of the most talented dulcimer musicians in the world and Sasha’s IQ is so high she’s a single lab accident away from being a supervillain and taking over the world.\n\nObama, who suddenly feels like an outcast in a family of such amazing people, will step aside and even back Michelle’s 2020 run for president, but he will not agree to paying any form of support for Sasha, who is still a minor, mostly because she makes more money playing Texas Hold ’em in a month than he makes in a year.\n\nIt’s lucky for us that we don’t have to have this kind of craziness in our White House anymore.

"MUSLIM NURSES REFUSE TO WASH HANDS BEFORE OPERATIONS, THE REASON WHY IS INSANE – HARDCORENEWS\nMuslim nurses in the UK have now been granted the option of participating in medical operations without washing their hands. If this gives you the willies and makes you feel a bit icky inside, it should. Washing hands is a basic tenet of good hygiene and helps prevent the spread of diseases and infections, especially to those most susceptible to them, such as individuals receiving an operation. Check out the reason given by these nurses to justify this insanity.The demand first derived from Islamic Sharia Law. Muslim nurses feared that washing their hands in the operating room, “compromises their modesty.” Of course, medical experts argued that not practicing proper sanitation before a procedure compromises the safety of patients instead.\n\nStill, Muslim nurses now have the option to wear disposable plastic over-sleeves, rather than scrubbing their hands. The Department of Health in the UK addressed concerns about the solution by stating that “the guidance is intended to balance infection control measures with cultural beliefs.” So it’s true. Sharia law is actually hazardous to your health. Wonder if it would be possible to get a Surgeon General’s warning slapped on every Koran sold in the U.S.?\n\nWhile UK medical officials are taking a few steps to limit the nurse’s exposure to patients, this is still gross and shouldn’t be allowed. If washing their hands in public violates their religion, they have the freedom to pursue a different career path.\n\nTo allow this type of egregious neglect of basic hygiene puts people unnecessarily at risk for developing an infection. Hopefully common sense will prevail and this allowance will be overturned. One more reason to be thankful we don’t have a healthcare system like Britain’s.","http://www.hardcoreusanews.com/2018/03/12/muslim-nurses-refuse-to-wash-hands-before-operations-the-reason-why-is-insane/","1520827200.0"
"Report: Puerto Rico Truckers Union, “Frente Amplio”, Refuse to Deliver Supplies – Use Hurricane Maria as Contract Leverage…\nPuerto Rican born and raised, Colonel Michael A. Valle (”Torch”), Commander, 101st Air and Space Operations Group, and Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, 1st Air Force, responsible for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, has the following comment:\n\n…They have the generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel on the ground, yet the supplies are not moving across the island as quickly as they’re needed.\n\n“It’s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government”.. (link)\n\nThe ports are so full of relief supplies they can’t fit any more on the available space. CNBC ground report confirms Colonel Valle’s ground report. WATCH:\n\n.\n\nThe reason for truck drivers not showing up? The Puerto Rican Truckers Union, Frente Amplio, is refusing to move the product.\n\nThe older man in this video (below) is the boss of a very sketchy (corrupt and violent) Puerto Rico trucker’s union called Fente Amplio. The Union Leader’s name is Victor Rodriguez. The reporter is pleading with Rodriquez to set aside his political grievances with the Puerto Rican governor. Mr. Rodriquez (toothless) angrily shouts NO, and states the truck drivers have a right to be mad and will punish Puerto Rico to prove their union’s strength.\n\nLabor union head Victor Rodriquez is complaining about a law that the governor passed three weeks ago. The reporter CONFIRMS that the truck drivers are refusing to work in order to get revenge on the governor. Rodriguez says that the governor’s policies have impacted truckers, so now truckers will show the country THEIR OWN suffering. The reporters says, “But all this stuff is in the past. In the present, it’s an emergency.” Rodriguez guy says that the country can now experience what the truckers experience due to the governor’s policies. Rodriquez says the truckers are not responsible for helping the country. That’s the governor’s job. Three weeks earlier, nobody cared about the plight of the truckers, so now the truckers don’t care about the country. This is all the governor’s fault, Rodriguez says. He passed a law, and now he has to live with it. The governor didn’t understand the suffering of the working man, so now the truckers will show the country what suffering is. Since the country doesn’t care about truckers, the truckers won’t help. (link)\n\nHere’s another report with three independent sources confirming the work stoppage:\n\nWAPA Television confirmed that the strike is related to a recently passed law known as “The Senate Project 525 meant to Administratively Transform the Public Service Commission.” The law covers the recognition of UBER and other transportation methods but Rodriguez refuses to listen to reason or hear related facts. The law is more commonly known as “The Senate’s 525 Project.” This video should dispel the rumors as to whether or not the supplies are sitting in the port because there isn’t fuel or because the drivers have been instructed NOT to drive.\n\nThere is no question that drivers were ordered NOT TO TOUCH THE TRUCKS as a retaliatory measure against the Governor of Puerto Rico. The Mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin decided to keep her mouth shut about the strike and insult President Trump instead. It was a foolish and unfortunate choice considering Puerto Rico is out in the middle of the ocean. President Trump doubled down his efforts and was preparing for the tragedy “even before” the hurricanes hit Puerto Rico.\n\nBeing a builder by profession and knowing what construction can handle (or not) Pres. Trump took tremendous measures and made extraordinary attempts to get goods to Puerto Rico and succeeded. The last thing he expected was that the local drivers would refuse to drive the trucks. When the statement of a rumor came up, we confirmed with three (3) independent and directly involved sources within media on the island as well as with Victor Rodriguez whether the “strike rumor” was true or not. Rodriguez stated that he would not change his position.

"BREAKING: Trump HUMILIATES Obama After White House Cleaning Staff Finds Secret Stash Of THIS\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 22.3k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nThe White House cleaning staff that served under Obama was removed and replaced this week with people more familiar and trusted by the Trumps. Their new head of housekeeping, Carmen Ortiz Santiago Delouise, was the head of housekeeping at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach Florida, having worked her way up from the laundry room.\n\nDelouise, who has worked for the Trumps for nearly 25 years, was tasked with a super-cleaning of the residence, as the Trumps tend to not feel at home until everything around them has been cleaned, sterilized and scented with the family pheromones. During the cleaning, Delouise and her staff came across a small compartment under a carpet in the master bedroom walk-in closet the Obamas must have forgotten they left there.\n\nInside they found a box containing 2 marijuana joints, a Zippo lighter and a gram of aged hashish. It seems the Obamas decided they’d use the White House as their own little drug den. Delouise gave her statement to a translator since she still speaks very little English:\n\n“The box was under the board in the closet. It looked very old and had strange letters engraved on it. You could clearly make out a backwards B, an M and what looked like some kind of Muslim symbol.”\n\nSince marijuana in small amounts is legal in DC, President Trump decided he would rather use the find to humiliate Obama and instead took out a full-page ad in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of the box and an offer to return Barry’s stash. The new White House Head of Housekeeping was also pushed through and given legal resident status, along with her family, as a reward for her hard work.\n\nIn the picture of the box, you can clearly see that a backwards B, which is the Muslim symbol for Barack, an M and a symbol experts believe to be an ancient Muslim emblem meaning “hungry” were painted on years ago. The contents of the box, of course, are indicative of the Obamas and their love for the thug life, gang symbols, Beyonce and Snoop Dogg:\n\nYet more proof that Obama spent his time in the White House wasting taxpayer money for his salary while he and his wife sat around getting stoned.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-trump-humiliates-obama-after-white-house-cleaning-staff-finds-secret-stash-of-this/","1486074926.0"

We will update you as more information becomes available.\n\n67) May 29, 2017 – Dr. Christopher King, 49, a famous holistic MD, was shot to death on Memorial day, a little after midnight, while eating at a popular organic restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. Louis Joseph Sebastian, whom he’d never met, gunned him down. A woman he’d dated said she accidentally texted him and invited him. Some state there was an argument that ensued before the death over the woman. A representative of the restaurant disputed this account, saying there was no evidence the two guests argued before walking out of the establishment. It was also mentioned that the shooter bragged about mob connections a lot that evening.\n\n68) July 1, 2017 – Holistic Dr. Scott Mieras was killed when the bus he was driving crashed in North Canterbury, New Zealand when his bus crashed through the railings of a bridge, landing in a shallow area of the Waiau River. He was the sole driver of the vehicle. No other vehicles were involved. He is survived by his two daughters.\n\n69) July 15, 2017 – Holistic Healer and Dr. Justine Damond was shot and killed by police. She had called officers to report a possible assault outside her house when she heard a woman screaming. She was shot by an officer as she approached the police vehicle in her pajamas. He shot past his partner in the closed vehicle and killed her, nearly killing others in the process.\n\n70) July 20, 2017 – Holistic MD Ron Schmid was found dead. He campaigned against the use of fermented cod liver oil, which had previously damaged his heart, he claimed.\n\n71) July 28, 2017 – Dr. Glen Scarpelli. Dr. Scarpelli and his wife both allegedly jumped out of window of their holistic clinic (located on Madison Avenue in Manhattan), leaving behind neatly typed and packaged suicide notes in plastic baggies. They jumped off the side street on 33rd street. The husband and wife said in the notes that they had a wonderful life but had some debt so they had to kill themselves. They said the kids were upstairs and to please take care of them. Their own colleagues (fellow doctors) said they don’t believe for a minute they took their own lives.\n\n72) July 29, 2017 – Dr. Andy Cutler part of the autism world and overall health community, died of an apparent heart attack.

According to the coroner’s report, she was found in her garage. Her family had previously stated it was a sudden natural death. Then the autopsy came out and her entire Facebook page was taken down. Our hearts are broken.\n\n74) August 4, 2017 -Dr. Gabriel Goodwin committed suicide by jumping from an NYC highrise. This happened not long after the similar death of Glen Scarpelli and wife (also in NYC) (#71). Goodwin had a history of mental health problems.\n\n75) August 7, 2017 – John Michael (Dr. Mike) Lonergam died of an apparent heart attack. His girlfriend was out of town, and he was alone at the time of death. His staff reported that he was healthy. He had a shot he gave that allegedly included vitamins called the Jesus shot. We will keep you posted as we receive more information.\n\n76) August 17, 2017 – Holistic Dr. Thomas Fay died of unknown causes and his family has called his death “unexpected and a bit surreal”. We know that Dr. Fay was outspoken about chemtrails, Sandy Hook, gun control and much more. We wish we had more information to share with you.\n\n77) September 13, 2017 – Dr. Achutha Reddy, a self described holistic psychiatrist, was stabbed to death countless times at his clinic and then allegedly outside the clinic as well. A patient was arrested and we’ll keep you updated on a convictions, trial etc.\n\n78) Friday, November 11, 2017 – Self described holistic Dr. Annie Fairbanks, 38, was found shot dead in her home along with her husband Jason Fairbanks, late 30s, and their 3 year old daughter and nine month old son. Police initially told neighbors to go inside and lock their doors (so neighbors reported live on TV). Authorities stated it might take some time to solve, but mere hours later stated it was a murder suicide with Jason Fairbanks murdering his entire family. From what we can see, he has zero criminal background, and friends of Annie write they are in absolute shock. A coworker said there were no cameras or security footage.\n\n79) Sunday, November 26, 2017- Dr Miguel Crespo, 40, stem cell and cancer researcher, was found dead in the bathroom on the 8th floor at the famous Weill Cornell Medical Center Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. (This is the SAME Weill Cornell where Dr Lorich #81 worked, who was also found dead in a bathroom just days later). Initially, authorities didn’t say what they thought the cause of death was but then said they were investigating a possible overdose. Even though the doctor didn’t have drugs with him on the scene, says the mainstream media. We have several prominent doctors who were studying stem cells for cancer, one of whom was the head of the entire Stem Cell Clinic of the UK.\n\n80) Saturday, December 3, 2017 – Dr. James Winer, the outspoken, controversial, prominent, self-described holistic doctor (and radio show host in several states) allegedly died on or around December 3rd. He was a well known alternative doctor out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We are told Dr Winer was found on the sidewalk unconscious and with no ID or wallet. He was brought in as a John Doe and missing for days to his staff and relatives. His family allegedly doesn’t know if there were others around or not, when he was found. He had no wife and kids. An autopsy was not done we are told so we aren’t certain of the cause of death, but we are told he died of a heart attack. Our heart goes out to his family, friends, and office staff. We have found in the past the best way to be is transparent or else they’ll be inundated for months with calls asking for the full story of this suspicious sudden death.\n\n81) Sunday, December 10, 2017- Dr Dean Lorich (MD) 54, was found dead in his Park Avenue home bathroom by his 11-year-old around 1 PM on Sunday, December 10th on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His wife and other daughters were out. Police almost immediately called it a suicide. Dr Lorich was one of the most skilled surgeons on the planet, operating on celebrities like Bono of U2, after a severe accident on his bike in Central Park. Despite Dr Lorich’s world-renowned surgical skills, authorities say he missed his heart and instead stabbed himself in the torso (close but not quite close enough). I had no idea when I broke this news that he had been on PBS’ Charlie Rose (before he was fired from his job recently) and penned an Op-Ed piece still on CNN about the “shameful” conditions in Haiti where he’d volunteered. He even wrote a letter that was forwarded to Hillary Clinton, which she did receive, and is on Wikileaks. You can read all about that here.\n\n82) Friday, December 15, 2017- Dr Barry Sherman 75, was found dead with his wife Honey 70, in their Toronto mansion on Friday, December 15th. Police said they suspect a murder-suicide but the grown children almost immediately released a statement about how shocked they were that the authorities would say something of that nature. They said there was no way it was murder or suicide as their parents were full of life and joy and that their family, friends, and even colleagues do NOT believe it. CBC said that Barry Sherman (who was not holistic but was always battling with “Big Pharma”) was one of the worlds largest generic drug manufacturers though reports say he actually started with nutraceuticals. Even his colleagues stated that pharma didn’t like him so much. You can read that and watch the new CBC tv video here.\n\n83) Saturday, December 16, 2017- Dr Tony Starr, an Osteopath, aged 52, was found dead at his residence by friends after failing to respond to text and telephone messages. Amongst many other qualifications, Dr Starr earned National Board Certification from the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians. Coroner Dr. Alan Spencer ordered his autopsy which could could take six to eight weeks to receive, hopefully we will know more then. He leaves behind his wife and children.\n\n84) Thursday, January 11, 2018- Dr Clive Bridgham, of East Providence, Rhode Island, was found dead in his home. At the time of his death the police believed he had been murdered but declined to provide any additional information. Bridgham had recently retired due to health reasons. He was a past president of the Chiropractic Society of Rhode Island and selected by the Rio Olympic Sports Medicine Committee to assist the health services team during the 2016 Summer Games.\n\n85) Friday, February 23, 2018- Dr. Mark Flanagan, age 62 of Seguin, Texas died after allegedly hanging himself. Friends were shocked as Flanagan was fit, healthy and fun loving, not plagued by depression or fear. In fact, one mutual friend, a medical doctor whose name will not be shared, said Mark would not do this. It’s just not how Mark would have behaved.\n\n86) Thursday, April 5, 2018- Dr. Timothy Cunningham, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s chronic disease unit, left work on Monday, February 12th because he wasn’t feeling well and wasn’t heard from again. The 35-year-old Morehouse and Harvard alumni was found on April 5 in a river near his home, with his favorite running shoes on. The police do not suspect foul play and yet, when someone leaves work sick, they do not tend to go home and either leave everything they love behind- including their car- or go out running- something they always do- and suddenly drown in the same river they have run near so often. Police had searched the area multiple times before suddently stumbling upon his body yesterday.\n\n87) Thursday, April 5, 2018- Dr. Norman Valdes Cotten Jr., 54, lived in Howell, MI and practiced in Fowlerville and Commerce Township. Police were called just before 10 a.m. on April 2nd, about a burning car parked at the closed Webster Elementary School. Once firefighters put out the blaze, they found Cotten’s badly burned body. (While the dates may seem off, the news was only reported to the public on April 5.) The preliminary cause of death was ruled as thermal burns and smoke and soot inhalation, beyond that the police have not said whether it was a homicide or suicide. The results of toxicology are pending.\n\n88) Thursday, April 19, 2018- World-famous traditional healer and elder Olivia Arévalo Lomas of the Shipibo Konibo Indigenous people of Peru was assassinated by five shots to the heart. “The unknown assailants killed her at her home in the community of Victoria Gracia located 20 minutes from the town of Yarinacocha, in front of her family and in the presence of children.” It is believed that she was assassinated because of her work to protect and preserve the people and environment. But Peru’s Ministry of Culture is working with the police and the prosecutor’s office to conduct a thorough investigation and have asked authorities for protection for her family. It seems other healers in the area have been threatened as well. We will update you as more information comes to light.\n\n89) Friday, April 20, 2018- Dr. Richard Caskey of Connecticut was found in the bathroom by his sons, who we are told are also chiropractors. We were contacted by some of his patients who said that office staff told them he (allegedly) had food poisoning at a conference just days before. As soon as we have more information we will update you.","http://www.healthnutnews.com/recap-on-my-unintended-series-the-holistic-doctor-deaths/","1457742792.0"
"Donald Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Ghana\nThe United States President, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow all Ghana nationals travel to the United States without visas.\n\nThe new order, serving as a change in visa policy for Ghanaians traveling to the United States, would permit them stay in the U.S for a maximum period of 180 days for Tourism or Business purposes only. Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa.\n\nTrump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Ghana.\n\nHowever, Ghanaians who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — the seven Muslim-majority countries “of concern”.\n\nIt has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Ghanaian Diplomats in the States.\n\nA source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australia’s opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country.\n\nAllowing Ghanaians to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office. He has signed five new executive orders – including one to expedite environmental review and approval of high-priority infrastructure projects.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed executive orders to advance the construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines.\n\nHe also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal funds from organizations that promote abortion around the world, including the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in what activists say is the president’s first major pro-life action while in office.\n\nThe policy, known as the Mexico City Policy or the Global Gag Rule, was first ushered in under Ronald Reagan and bars federal funds from going to foreign organizations that perform abortions overseas or lobby for the practice’s legalization in other countries.\n\nHe has formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, distancing America from its Asian allies as China’s influence in the region rises.\n\nFulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact, Trump signed an executive order in the Oval Office pulling the United States from the 12-nation TPP.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://usa-television.com/donald-trump-signs-a-visa-free-travel-policy-for-ghana/","1454148605.0"

"Man Arrested After Going On Murder Spree, Killing Over 30 Registered Sex Offenders\n0\n\nOMAHA, Nebraska –\n\nA Nebraska man was arrested after he was caught in the act of strangling someone to death in an alley outside of a Omaha McDonald’s, police say. According to reports, Joel Miller, 42, was arrested for assault and attempted murder, and during questioning admitted that he had killed more than 30 people already, all of them registered sex offenders.\n\n“I’ve been killing pedos and perverts for, damn, close to 15 years now,” said Miller. “Started when I was 26 or so, after a girl I was dating was raped and murdered. I tracked the guy down myself, slit his throat. I realized I had a real knack for it after that, so I kept going.”\n\nMiller says that he wishes he hadn’t gotten caught, because he has a list of at least 3 more local “perverts” that he wanted to “knock off.”\n\n“A friend of mine – we go way back – his daughter was molested by his babysitter’s boyfriend. Everyone knew he did it. The police couldn’t prove it. The girl, she’s only 7, she clammed right up. Barely spoken since, and she won’t admit it. Well, I did the world a favor when I cut his dick off and rammed it down his throat.”\n\nPolice say that, despite the “positive” nature of the crimes, Miller will still be more than likely sentenced to death for his crimes.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments","http://empirenews.net/man-arrested-after-going-on-murder-spree-killing-over-30-registered-sex-offenders/","None"
"Concerned, But Not Wanting To Offend, Canada Quietly Plants Privacy Hedge Along Entire U.S. Border.\n\n\n“And we’re happy to pay for it,” say a united front of Canadian premiers, national leaders, mayors, citizens, and casual acquaintances, of the newly planted hedge that has sprung up seemingly overnight, running unbroken for 6,416 kilometers, along the world’s longest undefended border.\n\n“Sometimes the best way for neighbours to get along, is a little bit of privacy. Even in the winter. Even when you have to break frozen ground to get it. Even when your neighbour has spy satellites and a penchant for caching electronic communications. Even then, a hedge can’t hurt.”\n\nA continuous growth of Cherry Laurel, the overnight hedge stands an average of two meters high, and is expected to grow to be at least double that by the end of Donald Trump’s first term, when a review of the green screen is planned. At that time the hedge will either be topped with barbed wire, or made into a tourist attraction by being trimmed to form a living storyboard of the Disney franchise.\n\n“What we do with the hedge will depend entirely on what’s happening to the south,” says one hedge-funder, Jim Freedman, a pretty nice guy who just wants to be left alone, while giving this reporter a tour of the newly defined perimeter. “If our neighbours opt to renew the presidency of a man who encourages nuclear proliferation, doubts climate change, mocks civil rights leaders – and anyone else who disagrees with him – all via the most reductive social media platform available well,” here Jim pauses and looks skyward, above the flourishing living fence he helped to put in place, “I’m told this thing can reach forty feet within a decade or two.”\n\nFollow The Out And Abouter on Facebook, or @OutandAbouter on Twitter, for the odd chuckle.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n","https://outabouter.com/2017/01/18/concerned-canada-quietly-plants-privacy-hedge-along-entire-u-s-border/","1484715600.0"
"Police: Charlottesville Was ‘Inside Job’ To Ignite Race War\nA Charlottesville police officer has come forward to express his anger at being told to “stand down” by the city mayor during violent clashes between protestors. He also claims the protests, which pitched “white supremacists” against members of Antifa, were “set up” to further the agenda of the elites.\n\n“We [Charlotesville police] were ordered to bring the rival groups together. As soon as they were in contact with each other, we were told to stand down. It was outrageous. We weren’t allowed to arrest anyone without asking the mayor first. We weren’t even allowed to stop the driver as he sped away.“\n\n“The event was being set up as far back as at least May and it went like clockwork.”\n\nNEW VIDEO: Car That Plowed Into Charlottesville Crowd Spotted Leaving the Scene pic.twitter.com/AQW6rvCAN8 — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) August 14, 2017\n\nMichael Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, ordered police to stand down during the most chaotic and destructive period of the protests – despite police protests against the orders.\n\n“We wanted to do our job and keep the peace. But these mother******s in charge really want to destroy America.”\n\nFox News reporter Doug McKelway was on the scene in Charlottesville and he backs up the police officer’s claims.\n\n“I can say, havig been in Emancipation Park from early on that morning, that what I saw with my own two eyes confirms what this law enforcement source told us. At least from all visible apearances. We saw people coming out of that park who had headwounds, who were bleeding from the head, people walking into that park with bats, with sticks — you saw what they were wearing — helmets, body armor, they had come — and this pertains to both sides — they had come to do damage.. you cannot help but notice from that video that police had been more pro-active, they could have potentially calmed this thing down to some degree.”\n\nMichael Signer is a Virginia Democratic activist with close ties to Barack Obama and John Podesta. Before landing the Charlottesville mayor job he previously worked closely with Podesta at the Center of American Progress and worked with him again on Barack Obama’s State Department Transition Team.\n\nThe New World Order, led in the United States by elite operatives Obama, Podesta, Soros, Clinton and company, are pulling out all the stops to create division through chaos and destruction. Crowds of paid protestors and useful psychopaths are being sent into pitched battle against one another to sour the mood of the nation and further divide us all.\n\nThey are manipulating and controlling newsworthy events in order to maintain power and control over the public, and to swing public opinion.\n\nDeep state operatives\n\nThe man accused of being a neo-Nazi and murdering a woman by deliberately driving into her during protests in Charlottesville is in reality a supporter of Hillary Clinton and member of Antifa in receipt of funding by George Soros.\n\nWhite supremacist and ‘Unite the Right’ leader, Jason Kessler, has been exposed as a supporter of former President Obama and the a hardline member of far-left Occupy movement.\n\nWhen did he change his political leaning? According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (an organization that is certainly no friend to Conservatives), Kessler revealed his political transformation around November 2016, the same month Donald Trump won the presidential election.\n\nIf you think that is suspicious, wait until you learn about the other actors in this enormous set-up event.\n\nFirst man on the scene\n\nBrennan Gilmore was “on the scene” and was the author of the first viral tweet about Charlottesville. He was later interviewed by MSNBC. He was presented as an accidental witness. But who is he really?\n\nGilmore worked in Africa as a State Department foreign officer under Hillary Clinton. The New York Times mentioned this “coincidence” – and then later deleted it. Brennan Gilmore was also involved with the Kony hoax in 2012, and he is currently Chief of Staff for Tom Perrielo, who is running for Governor of Virginia and received $380k from George Soros.\n\nSo the first man on the scene, whose tweet went viral, and who was later interviewed on mainstream news as a witness, just happened to be a State Department insider with a long history of involvement in psy-ops? If you think this isn’t fishy, how about this – since the Charlottesville protests and his appearance in the media, his information was suddenly removed from State Department websites.\n\nThe elites know we are onto them, and they are trying to cover their tracks. They can censor Google and social media and close down accounts, but they will never be able to stop us sharing information and speaking to each other.","http://yournewswire.com/charlottesville-inside-job/","1502813511.0"

But not for this Tennessee couple who had been “living in the lap of luxury” above a Tennessee Walmart store. The ‘homeless’ man, 48-year-old Wilbert Thomas, admitted to police that he and his girlfriend 54-year-old Ingrid Malone, had been living above the store for over two years. What they did to the attic, baffled police and store employees.\n\n“I don’t mean to laugh, but these people really got one over on Walmart,” said Lieut. Marshall Weiss. “In the attic, we recovered 2 pounds of meth they had somehow produced on a hot plate. They also managed to get food, drinks, mini refrigerator, a big screen TV, surround sound system, bedroom set, hangers, clothes… I mean, if Walmart sells it they had it. These people were living good. They even managed to splice into the satellite TV wire and ordered NFL Sunday ticket!”\n\nHomeless Couple Found Living In Walmart Attic With Hot Plate, Meth Lab, And 42″ LED TV\n\nThe couple was discovered when employees in the break room heard banging from above. Apparently the couple was engaging in intercourse when the new headboard to their queen sized bed, which they also took from the store, was banging against one of the attic dividers. During Thomas’s confession, he also admitted stealing K-Y Jelly Yours+Mine which he says “screwed up everything and got us busted.”","http://now8news.com/homeless-couple-found-living-in-walmart-attic/","1490862673.0"
"Meet 'next Obama' groomed to make political history\nThe Democratic Party may have found its next Barack Obama.\n\nHis name is Dr. Abdul el-Sayed, he’s a 32-year-old medical doctor and he recently launched his campaign for governor of Michigan, the election for which is in November 2018. If he wins he would be America’s first Muslim governor.\n\nHe speaks articulately, without an accent, inserts humor into his speeches at seemingly just the right moments, and he has the full backing of America’s powerful Muslim Brotherhood-linked network of Islamic organizations.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, El-Sayed said Michigan voters are having “buyer’s remorse,” and that President Trump’s decisions “are at odds with deeply held American values, and distractions from real issues.”\n\nSayed served as the executive director of the Detroit Health Department and Health Officer for the City of Detroit, appointed by Mayor Mike Duggan. At 30 years old, he was at the time of his appointment in 2015 the youngest health director in a major U.S. city.\n\nAccording to El-Sayed, his decision to run for governor was influenced by concerns over state leadership following the lead-tainted water crisis in Flint, as well as policies being implemented in Washington, D.C., under President Trump.\n\nDick Manasseri, spokesman for Secure Michigan, a group that educates Michiganders about the threat of Shariah law, predicts that Sayed will at least win the Democratic nomination for governor.\n\nAmerica is headed down a suicidal path – but it’s a subtle invasion. Get all the details in the brand-new book “Stealth Invasion: Muslim Conquest Through Immigration and Resettlement Jihad,” available now at the WND Superstore.\n\n“It is the exact same thing as Barack Obama in Chicago in the early 2000s,” said Manasseri. “He’s young, attractive, he does not give out a lot of information, he speaks in platitudes about celebrating inclusiveness and diversity.”\n\nSayed is known as a warrior for environmental justice. He talks about “standing up to corporate polluters,” and how, in his family, he was taught that having “love and compassion” for the vulnerable are “more important than where you’re from.”\n\n“How could any good progressive Democrat vote against that in good conscience?” asks Manasseri.\n\nSayed is highly educated, a Rhodes scholar who attended Oxford University in 2009 and became a practicing epidemiologist.\n\n“He’s very well packaged,” Manasseri said. “He’s far more accomplished than Barack Obama. Obama was not this accomplished, they connected him to certain foundations and his candidacy took off.”\n\nSayed is the recipient of several research awards, including being named one of the Carnegie Council’s Policy Innovators. He created and taught the Mailman School’s first-ever course on systems science and population health. He co-edited a textbook on the topic published in 2017 by Oxford University Press entitled “Systems Science and Population Health.”\n\nIn his new video ad Sayed says that as Detroit’s health director one of the first big things he did was come up with a government program to purchase eyeglasses for every kid that needed a pair. “Why? Because every child deserves the right to see what’s on the blackboard,” he said in his campaign launch speech.\n\nHe pointed to his hand as the map of Michigan [a very folksy thing to do] to locate Gratiot County, “in the heartland of Michigan,” the place where he was born to Egyptian-immigrant parents and raised by his dad, Muhammad, and his stepmother Jacqueline, a native Michigander.\n\nWatch Sayed’s 2-minute campaign ad for governor of Michigan:\n\nIn his campaign launch on Feb. 25 at Detroit’s Eastern Market, Sayed talked about his dad growing up one of six kids in a one-bedroom apartment in Egypt and coming to America and bringing his diversity of culture to Michigan. It’s all about celebrating multiculturalism, he said, standing at a podium in the market amid supporters holding signs that read “Abdul for Michigan.”\n\n“He would come to this market to buy the foods to make the dishes that would make him feel at home. You see this market for him brought him home, from Alexandria right here in Detroit. Some of my most wholesome memories took place right here,” Sayed said. “And I remember buying those foods… but not only that I remember the diversity of faces that I would experience here, black and white, Asian, Latino. People who are coming together to celebrate something, together. Farmers and truckers and factory workers. Families from up north doing business with families from right here in Detroit. Each of them Buying and selling the same exact ingredients that they would take home to turn into the dishes that celebrated their families’ history.”\n\nSayed promotes what he calls his “rather unusual American story.”\n\nWatch Abdul Sayed’s full campaign-launch speech.\n\nHe said his proud Egyptian parents, Fattah and Muhammad, emigrated to the U.S. “in search of a better life.” Muhammad came originally on a student visa to attend Wayne State University.\n\n“When they came here they took a bet on an America that was big enough for them, too. They believed in a country that would give them dignified well-paying jobs, that would educate their children. Where they could pray however they wanted to pray.”\n\nSayed said his “diverse if highly unlikely family” taught him that “what you believe and stand for is more important than where you come from, to have compassion and care and respect for those more vulnerable.” He said he was taught that “real leaders are those that can stand firm against the powerful, stand strong with the weak, and stand humbly before God.”\n\nAt the Thanksgiving dinner table, “which is a very diverse dinner table,” hosted by he and his wife Sarah, he said his family includes a Presbyterian deacon from Flint, an imam from Egypt and an atheist-Polish uncle who is a professor at Michigan.\n\n“And they share hard conversations about life in American and they don’t always agree, but they respect and love each other…they share a common future that brings them together. And as Michiganders, so do we.”\n\nManaserri says the Muslim Brotherhood would never support a candidate that didn’t have tons of money behind him and that they did not believe “has a real chance of winning.”\n\n“Any Republican would be afraid to confront him on his Muslim Brotherhood connections or his views on Shariah,” Manasseri said. “He is a devout Shariah-compliant guy, and I would predict that he will be endorsed by the Catholic Church, which is very powerful in Michigan.”\n\nManasseri points out that a bill supporting American Law for American Courts, widely regarded as an anti-Shariah law, was defeated in the Michigan Legislature when two powerful lobbies – the Michigan Catholic Conference and the Council on American-Islamic Relations or CAIR – teamed up to kill it. He expects the same coalition to form behind a candidate who would make history as America’s first Muslim governor.\n\n“So if this guy rises in the polls, I would predict the Catholic Church will support his candidacy,” he said. “Just like with Obama, because we gotta make history.”\n\n“It’s Obama II,” Manasseri said. “Elizabeth Warren will be coming to campaign for him, the Democrats in other states will be raising money for him. The DNC number-two man [Keith Ellison] will be raising money for him. Of course this guy is going to be on the Sunday morning talk shows. He’ll be everywhere. A candidate for governor who is Muslim Brotherhood …if that doesn’t tell you there’s a Shariah swamp in Michigan I don’t know what does.”","http://www.wnd.com/2017/04/meet-the-next-obama-groomed-to-make-political-history/","None"
"FBI RAIDS OBAMA – Find Massive Secret That Was Hidden For YEARS\nWhen Barack Obama was in office, he and his fellow Democrats were able to get away with absolutely anything. Now that Donald Trump is in office, however, he’s blowing the lid open on the nation’s sleaziest scandals, and anything with Obama’s name on it is being looked at.\n\nRecently, a long overdue raid was conducted in South Carolina, and what was discovered is worse than we initially thought.\n\nFreedom Daily reported that the owner of a Columbia, South Carolina gas station named after Obama has been arrested and charged with tax evasion. The Department of Revenue confirmed that Murad A. Alhanik, owner of the Obama Mart on North Main Street, has been charged with four counts of sales tax evasion.\n\nOfficials say Alhanik did not pay more than $136,000 in sales taxes over four years, and that he evaded taxes by underreporting sales from 2013 to 2016.\n\n“Alhanik filed monthly sales tax returns reporting a total of $971,935 in gross sales. However, the DOR investigation revealed actual sales to be $2,688,533. Due to the underreported sales, the defendant evaded paying $136,753 in sales taxes due to the state of South Carolina,” the DOR said in a statement.\n\nClearly, just like his idol Obama, Alhanik thought he was above the law.\n\nAlhanik is facing up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each count.\n\nAlhanik bought the South Carolina gas station in 2011 and made headlines when he named it after Trump. He claimed that the rebranding resulted in an uptick of business.\n\n“I see more people come in,” Alhanik said. “Excited with the name.”\n\nIn January of 2017, Alhanik boasted that he would not be changing the name of the store despite Obama not being president anymore because “it’s still history.”\n\nWe’re glad to see that Alhanik has finally been brought to justice. Hopefully, his idol Obama can join him in prison soon as well!","http://maxipolitics.com/fbi-raids-obama-find-massive-secret-that-was-hidden-for-years/","1517992490.0"
"Melania Trump Bans White House Staff From Taking Flu Shot\nFirst Lady Melania Trump has banned White House staff from receiving the flu shot after learning of the adverse health effects associated with the controversial vaccine, according to reports.\n\nWhile public debate rages about the safety of this season’s flu shot, Melania Trump says that as far as she is concerned, she won’t have people endangering her son with their “dangerous” flu shot diseases.\n\n“I will not allow incubators of dangerous viruses to come anywhere near my son,” the First Lady said.\n\nAfter researching the ingredients used in making the flu shot, and becoming concerned about potential negative health effects, including death, Melania Trump said she was “amazed that it [flu shot] is being pushed so hard by the media this year.“\n\nThe First Lady, who proudly describes herself as a “full-time mom”, then realized that this year’s flu shot is only 10% effective – and the flu strains contained in the vaccine may be responsible for spreading serious cases of influenza.\n\nMany of the victims of this year’s deadly flu epidemic – including many of the dead – received a flu shot shortly before they came down with the virus.\n\nIn Santa Barbara eight people had died of the flu this month. Seven of them had the flu shot. This deadly pattern is replicating itself across the country, yet health officials are still telling people to get the flu shot, even though it does not work this season.\n\nIn the interests of her son Barron’s health – as well as her own – Melania decided to avoid the flu shot this year. She also decided to clean up the White House, encouraging staffers against taking the flu shot.\n\nBut as Melania explained, this wasn’t as easy as it sounds. Every year the pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media work hard to convince us to get vaccinated against the flu. 2018 is no different.\n\nBut, as usual, we’re not being told the whole story.\n\nPharmaceutical companies provide mainstream media outlets with a huge percentage of their advertising revenue. Big pharmaceutical companies actually spend far more on advertising than research. We are talking hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nBig Pharma’s dollars effectively purchase the obedience of mainstream media. You can no longer believe anything they say about pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines.\n\nIt is clear Big Pharma is desperate to ensure mainstream media outlets never tell us about adverse reactions or the toxic chemicals being injected into us in the flu shot.\n\nWhile the CDC attempts to convince us that the flu shot is safe, doctors working for the agency have warned us that the opposite is true.\n\nThe sad fact is that we cannot rely on the CDC and mainstream media to protect us. We must do our own research and educate ourselves.\n\nIn the First Lady’s case, her self-education led to her total ban on the flu shot among White House staffers, encouraging the use of natural immunity-boosters, instead of the ineffective and dangerous vaccine.\n\nMelania said that in order to justify the ban to the staffers, she had to provide “plenty of scientific evidence.“\n\n“I have a friend who is a holistic doctor, she provides me with most of my dietary advice and nutritional supplements. She provided me with a wealth of information about the reality of vaccines in 2018,” the First Lady said.\n\n“I spent a lot of time researching, reading, really studying the subject. I had to feel totally confident I was making the right decision for my son.”\n\n“It took a few months but I finally felt totally confident with my decision.”\n\n[RELATED: Trump Lays Groundwork To Ban Mandatory Vaccinations Across U.S.]\n\nThe influence that Big Pharma has over the U.S. population is profound, and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking, you realize that Big Pharma is everywhere. And, unfortunately, they are more interested in profits than public health.\n\nBut as Melania Trump says, once you educate yourself and make the effort to avoid their unnecessary products, you will find peace of mind, and the health of your family will improve.","http://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-white-house-flu-shot/","1516643943.0"

"Palin Blames Florida Shooting On “Obama’s Policy Of Allowing Mexican Muslims To Walk Freely On Our Streets”\nFive people have been shot dead by a gunman at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida, say officials. It happened at the baggage claim area in Terminal 2, just before 1300 local time (1800 GMT), the airport confirmed. Five people were killed, eight injured and one person was unharmed in custody, said police and local officials. Hundreds of people were standing on the tarmac outside the terminal as dozens of police cars and ambulances rushed to the scene. A witness told MSNBC that the gunman was a “slender man” who was wearing a Star Wars T-shirt. Florida Senator Bill Nelson told media that the gunman has been identified as Esteban Santiago, but that has not been confirmed by law enforcement.\n\nFormer half-term governor of Alaska Sarah Palin took to the press to offer her thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims, but also used the opportunity to once again criticize former President Barack Obama’s policy on illegal immigration. “First of all, I’d like to offer my condolences to the families of the victims of the Fort Lauderdale terrorist attack, as well as my support to those who have been injured in the incident,” she said. “Make no mistake – this was a full-on terrorist attack, the likes of which we’ve had several in the past months and years. These lone-wolf terrorist attacks have today become a danger far greater than any terrorist cell that might be planning an attack on U.S. soil. It is terrible that we are faced with such an unpredictable network of individuals who will stop at nothing in order to harm innocent civilians.”\n\nShe added, “However, don’t be fooled by the idea that there was no stopping this sort of escalation of terrorist violence. We could have prevented all of this 8 years ago, but unfortunately, the citizens of this country – more specifically, true, conservative Americans were outvoted by those who believed Barack Obama was the right choice for president. Eight years later, I’m sad to say America is choking on terrorism, racial issues and gender catastrophes the likes of which are unknown in its recent history. Not only were the liberals not right; they have single-handedly surrendered this country into the hands of a man who’s done more damage to it than any Bush, Reagan or Stalin, for that matter, ever could.”\n\n“It is Barack Obama’s policy of allowing Mexican Muslims to walk freely on our streets that has caused so much death and destruction recently, including this latest incident which has taken 5 innocent lives,” she continued. “Think about that for a second. Why were Mexican Muslims even allowed to walk our streets in the first place, I ask you? They’re, like, double the threat – they’re half Muslim, which means that they hate all of America by default, and the other half is Mexican, which means they can be very hard-working, but at the same time, they’re also very jealous of white people. And if, by some miracle, you were to add just an ounce of Germanic heritage to that, you’d have Hitler in the mix as well. That means they’d be the ultimate killing machine. They should have been incarcerated from the beginning. Instead, we’re left with this situation.”\n\n“I guarantee you no potential gunman would have ever seen the light of day other than through prison bars if anyone other than Barack Obama had been president. All Muslim Mexicans would be scrutinized several times, compared to normal Muslims and Mexicans, the majority of whom would only be subjected to one scrutinization process yearly. Instead, they were left to their own twisted behavior under the excuse of civil liberties, and what happened? We had the Orlando gay club massacre, and now Fort Lauderdale. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out there’s a pretty obvious pattern here. And you better believe there’s more of them coming. So, when the next one happens, I’m not even going to look into who or what the shooter was. I’m directly going after Obama for carelessness on the job and dereliction of duty. Because, he was many things as president, but a patriot was not one of them,” Palin concluded.","http://politicono.com/palin-blames-florida-shooting-obamas-policy-allowing-mexican-muslims-walk-freely-streets/","1483731191.0"

"Feces Found in Starbucks Drinks\nDear Starbucks fans of the world,\n\nI deeply regret what I'm about to tell you. I don't want to deliver this news, but as a fellow Starbucks enthusiast, I feel it's my coffee-lover's duty to do so. An investigation has revealed the discovery of feces in iced drinks from Starbucks in the UK. As in, fecal bacteria. In multiple samples of Starbucks iced beverages.\n\nBBC's investigative television series Watchdog conducted an investigation of the ice from three of the UK's biggest coffee chains, which include Starbucks, Costa Coffee, and Caffe Nero. The results found levels of fecal bacteria in the iced drinks from all three places. WTF.\n\nBBC's Tony Lewis said, 'These should not be present at any level — never mind the significant numbers found.' We'd have to agree, Tony.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt Starbucks specifically, three out of 10 samples tested by BBC contained fecal bacteria. Starbucks is reportedly looking into the claim and will hopefully update its guidelines on the protocol for cleaning its ice machines — the likely culprit of the bacteria-filled ice.

"Colorado: Hunter claims he was sexually assaulted by a sasquatch\nDarrel Whitaker from Glenwood Springs in Colorado claims a sasquatch attacked him and attempted to rape him while he was walking in the woods.\n\nThe 57-year-old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter.\n\nAll of a sudden, a large “gorilla-like” creature dropped from a tree in front of him and punched him in the face.\n\n“It was at least 8-foot tall and its punches hurt like hell! I was knocked right out at the first blow!”\n\nWhile Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.\n\n“When I regained consciousness, he had already torn my pants and was tearing through my underwear. I stabbed him in the shoulder with my hunting knife, and that made him run away.”\n\nMr. Whitaker immediately reported the attack to both the Glenwood Springs Police Department (GSPD) and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency and a joint investigation has been launched.\n\nDarrel Whitaker is convinced that the creature who attacked him was a sasquatch, but the GSPD investigators say it’s more probable that the attacker is simply a particularly large and hairy man.\n\nThey are currently interrogating nearby residents to see if anyone noticed an individual corresponding to the description of the suspect.\n\nAccording to the victim, the attacker measure around 8-foot tall and is extremely hairy. He has brown hair, dark brown eyes, and extremely large feet.\n\nIf you possess any information concerning the suspect, please contact the Glenwood Springs Police Department or the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency.","http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/colorado-hunter-claims-he-was-sexually-assaulted-by-a-sasquatch/","1494532481.0"
"Australia To Forcibly Vaccinate Citizens Via Chemtrails\nAustralia have approved the license application from Big Pharma company PaxVax that will allow them to intentionally release a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into Queensland, via chemtrails.\n\nThe Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) says that the vaccine qualifies as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000.\n\nPreventdisease.com reports:\n\nPaxVax is seeking approval to conduct the clinical trial of a genetically modified live bacterial vaccine against cholera.\n\nOnce underway the trial is expected to be completed within one year, with trial sites selected from local government areas (LGAs) in Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. PaxVax has proposed a number of control measures they say will restrict the spread and persistence of the GM vaccine and its introduced genetic material, however there is always a possiblity of these restrictions failing and infecting wildlife and ecosystems.\n\nAerial vaccines have used in the United States directed towards animals by the use of plastic packets dropped by planes or helicopters.Sanofi (who is one of the largest vaccine manufacturers in the world) has subsidiary companies such as Merial Limited who manufacture Raboral, an oral live-virus poisonous to humans yet distributed wildlife in the masses.\n\nWEST NILE VIRUS SPRAYING\n\nIn 2006 Michael Greenwood wrote an article for the Yale School of Public Health entitled, “Aerial Spraying Effectively Reduces Incidence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Humans.” The article stated that the incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through large scale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes, according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health.\n\nUnder the mandate for aerial spraying for specific vectors that pose a threat to human health, aerial vaccines known as DNA Vaccine Enhancements and Recombinant Vaccine against WNV may be tested or used to “protect” the people from vector infection exposures. DNA vaccine enhancements specifically use Epstein-Barr viral capside’s with multi human complement class II activators to neutralize antibodies. The recombinant vaccines against WNV use Rabbit Beta-globulin or the poly (A) signal of the SV40 virus. In early studies of DNA vaccines it was found that the negative result studies would go into the category of future developmental research projects in gene therapy. During the studies of poly (A) signaling of the SV40 for WNV vaccines, it was observed that WNV will lie dormant in individuals who were exposed to chicken pox, thus upon exposure to WNV aerial vaccines the potential for the release of chicken pox virus would cause a greater risk to having adult onset Shingles.\n\nCALIFORNIA AERIAL SPRAYING for WNV and SV40\n\nIn February 2009 to present date, aerial spraying for the WNV occurred in major cities within the State of California. During spraying of Anaheim, CA a Caucasian female (age 50) was exposed to heavy spraying, while doing her daily exercise of walking several miles. Heavy helicopter activity occurred for several days in this area. After spraying, she experienced light headedness, nausea, muscle aches and increased low back pain. She was evaluated for toxicological mechanisms that were associated with pesticide exposure due to aerial spraying utilizing advanced biological monitoring testing. The test results which included protein band testing utilizing Protein Coupled Response (PCR) methods were positive for KD-45. KD-45 is the protein band for SV-40 Simian Green Monkey virus. Additional tests were performed for Epstein-Barr virus capside and Cytomeglia virus which are used in bioengineering for gene delivery systems through viral protein envelope and adenoviral protein envelope technology. The individual was positive for both; indicating a highly probable exposure to a DNA vaccination delivery system through nasal inhalation.\n\nPentagon Document Revealed Aerial Vaccination Plans\n\nIn the Quarterly FunVax Review in June, 2007, the report lists the objective of a project listed as ID: 149AZ2 as a preparation of a viral vector that will inhibit/decrease the expression of a specific disruption gene (VMAT2) within a human population. It further indicates in the abstract that six method of virus dispersal were tested including high altitude release, water supply release, insect transmission, and various methods of diffusion.\n\nThis article was originally published in 2016 and is updated regularly","http://yournewswire.com/australia-to-forcibly-vaccinate-citizens-via-chemtrails/","1457050469.0"

"Elijah Wood Claims Hollywood Is Gripped By A Powerful Paedophile Ring\nElijah Wood has claimed that Hollywood is in the grip of a child sexual abuse scandal.\n\nThe actor who played Frodo Baggins in the lord of the rings said that Hollywood has been been gripped by cases of sexual abuse similar to the Jimmy Savile scandal in Britain — and that the child abuse is ‘probably still happening’.\n\nHe told the Sunday Times that there were “a lot of vipers in this industry…there is darkness in the underbelly”.\n\nHe also said that his mother had protected him from abuse when he became an actor at the age of eight years old but said other young actors had been “preyed upon”.\n\nThe Mail Online reports:\n\nShocking allegations that top Hollywood figures have been protecting child abusers have circulated widely in recent years.\n\nSeveral industry figures have been convicted following claims of sex abuse and former child actors – including The Goonies actor Corey Feldman, 44 – claimed he was ‘surrounded’ by molesters when he was a teenager.\n\nAnne Henry, co-founder of Bizparentz – a group to help young actors – said that Tinseltown is currently sheltering around ‘100 active abusers’.\n\nWood, who stars in his new film The Trust told The Sunday Times that his mother had protected him from abuse when he first arrived in Hollywood aged eight.\n\nBut he said: ‘I’ve been led down dark paths to realise that these things are probably still happening.’\n\nThe actor, who played Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings, believes that other actors remain in danger.\n\nHe added: ‘If you’re innocent, you have very little knowledge of the world and you want to succeed.\n\n‘People with parasitic interests will see you as their prey. What upsets me about these situations is that the victims can’t speak as loudly as the people in power.’\n\nWood was talking to the Sunday Times about Jimmy Savile, a British entertainer who sexually abused dozens of victims over five decades.\n\nHe was knighted by the Queen and his crimes were only revealed after his death, despite years of rumor and innuendo and led to allegations of a cover-up by government figures and broadcasting chiefs.\n\nHenry believes that around three quarters of child actors that ‘went off the rails’ later in their life had been abused in Hollywood.\n\nShe said: ‘This problem has been endemic in Hollywood for a long time and it’s finally coming to light.\n\n‘Very bad people are still working here, protected by their friends.’\n\nIn the last 10 years, several wealthy and significant people involved in the industry have been convicted.\n\nSome have left prison and returned to Hollywood and continued to work with children.\n\nWood, who now knows he was lucky to avoid being abused, compared the allegations in Hollywood to the claims linked to Savile following his death in October 2011.\n\nWood said: ‘You all grew up with Savile – Jesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organised.\n\n‘There are a lot of vipers in this industry.

"A Female-Led Construction Company Built The Florida Bridge That Collapsed – Minuteman Militia\nFlorida has been having its bad stroke of luck as of late. First the horrible tragedy in Parkland, and now this; Florida International University’s “instant bridge,” spontaneously collapsing earlier on Thursday. The two companies responsible for the poorly constructed bridge were MCM and Figg, both have a sketchy history when it comes to construction, but for today’s purposes, we’re going to focus on MCM, because there’s a valuable lesson that can be learned here.\n\nThat lesson is this; there are some things that women shouldn’t do. There are some things women can’t do. One of these is construction.\n\nThough MCM is owned by five brothers, a lot of people one rung down the ladder from them are women. Some of the construction workers are even women. How ironic is it then, that earlier this month, MCM was slapped with a lawsuit for hiring “incompetent, inexperienced, unskilled or careless employees.” Fox reports:\n\nThe company is building an expansion to Fort Lauderdale International Airport and a worker there was injured when a makeshift bridge collapsed under his weight, the lawsuit says, according to the Winston Salem-Journal.\n\nLeonor Flores, FIU alumna, and MCM project exec says her number one priority when building bridges is to make sure they look pretty. Nothing else matters:\n\n“It’s very important for me as a woman and an engineer to be able to promote that to my daughter because I think women have a different perspective. We’re able to put in an artistic touch and we’re able to build too.”\n\nNo. You can’t build things. The bridge collapsed for no other reason than terrible structure. Though the death toll is currently at six, police say that the number is likely to rise. But no, let’s talk about how strong and powerful these women are. This company prides itself on how many women they hire, saying that it’s a big step towards gender equality. That’s not working out so far, is it? There’s a reason you don’t hear about women in construction; they’re not very good at it, and quite frankly, they don’t want to be. Women in MCM promote feminism when it’s convenient; when everybody’s looking tough and ready to conquer the world in their construction hat. But when their projects fail, and lives are lost, everyone wants to focus on all the men in the company. Nobody, not them or the mainstream media is talking about all these women and how they dropped the ball. None of them want to take responsibility, and that makes both the media and these women spineless cowards.\n\nSOURCE\n\nShare this: Print\n\n","https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.minuteman-militia.com/2018/03/19/female-led-construction-company-built-florida-bridge-collapsed/","1521432000.0"

"BREAKING: Federal Judge Grants Permission To Subpoena Trump\nFederal Judge Peter J. Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.\n\nD.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can now subpoena the Trump organization, thereby forcing them to preserve documents in relation to President Trump’s alleged indiscretions.\n\nThe case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court’s ruling.\n\n“This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments,” Racine said in a statement.\n\nPer the Post:\n\nBecause Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties — in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments — Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed “unprecedented constitutional violations.” State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president “shall not receive” any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from “the United States, or any of them.”\n\nThe Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasn’t convinced with their argument.\n\nPresident Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion.","http://news.groopspeak.com/breaking-federal-judge-grants-permission-to-subpoena-trump/","1511992336.0"

"Facebook Secrets: Want to See Who’s Monitoring Your Facebook?\nFacebook monitoring and censorship is at an all time high. With so many attacks on Independent and Citizen Journalism as of late, wouldn’t it be nice to know who is monitoring your page? With these Facebook secrets, now you can!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: 01/3/2017 –\n\nWith the help of the most amazing readers and truth seekers on the planet, we have received so much feedback on this article! To update, Facebook’s algorithms prevent malicious blocking attempts on an account, which explains why some accounts cannot be blocked (as noted toward the end of this article).\n\nWe reached out to Facebook through official channels, and received a message that we would be contacted about our inquiry. We have not been contacted. (We asked about profiles that say “Facebook security.”)\n\nAs was noted originally, it isn’t clear, nor is there a way to know for sure who those people are, but what we do know is that the feature to prevent blocking is built in to Facebook, and their search feature brings up a relevant list of names.\n\nCitizen journalism and research is a powerful tool, and this proves it. Nothing is more exciting than when people are active in making sure their rights and privacy is protected!\n\nIn a world of universal deceit – telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\n\n\n\nThat is one of my favorite quotes. It applies to this post, because social media has become home to the worlds largest platform’s for news and information. If you write articles, have a blog, and/or otherwise use some sort of mechanism to disseminate information, you are probably on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIn recent times, we have seen a huge increase in attempts to silence dissent, censor independent and alternative news sources, and redirect the public back to the mainstream. This inorganic attempt to steer the public away from posts or news sources that don’t fit the mainstream narrative or status quo is failing. Miserably.\n\nThe truth is, people want real news and information, and real news and information, is always much more intense. Reality and truth itself is always much stranger than fiction, as the saying goes. Of course, social media censors and the media will say independent media uses “dangerous tactics” that they call “click bait” to grab their viewers.\n\nWhile it is certainly true some websites are known for this, overall, it may just appear that way more or less due to the fact that as stated earlier, the truth is raw and to those who are asleep, it really is fantastic.\n\nWith these recent attempts to censor anyone who doesn’t fit the status quo, Facebook announced it will employ new methods to combat so-called “fake news.” As one may predict, the “sources” who will have the power to “review” posts for “authenticity,” have an obvious conflict of interest.\n\nIn addition, did you know there are people literally watching your Facebook account? Yes. There are people who have a specific duty to monitor your posts and activity. While there are many Facebook secrets, for those who enjoy privacy, this one is for you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Secrets: So, what can you do?\n\nFirst of all, we must tell you there is no way to know for sure who these people are. Also, you may not be able to remove or block every account that monitors your activity, although when I did it on my account, I was able to get rid of most.\n\nHere is what you need to do to block the majority of the accounts that monitor your Facebook:\n\n1. > Log into Facebook\n\n2. > Account Settings\n\n3. > Click on blocking\n\n4. > In the search field where it says “Block Users” type in: “Facebook Security”\n\n5. > A new window will pop up.

"BREAKING: Obama PERSONALLY Called Harvard And Ordered Them To Reverse Malia’s Suspension\nIf you haven’t heard, Malia Obama was recently arrested in Chicago after purchasing a whopping six pounds of marijuana (a seller’s quantity according to police) from a drug lord her father had released from prison in 2015.\n\nThe teenage Obama faces a good bit of time in prison and has even been suspended from Harvard until the conclusion of the trial, but the regular course of justice is not acceptable to the Obama family.\n\nAccording to sources within Harvard, Barack Obama called school president Harmon Finklestein and angrily demanded that his daughter be allowed to attend the university. Of course, he caved.\n\n“It has been brought to our attention that the young Miss Obama has not been found guilty of a crime and therefore we acted hastily in suspending her,” Finklestein said in a statement late Sunday night. “We sincerely apologize to the Obama family and specifically to Malia for any harm we caused.”\n\nThe lifting of Obama’s suspension means she can move into the dorms with other students, perhaps with drugs she obtained elsewhere.\n\nThere is no justice when the Obamas are involved.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/08/breaking-obama-personally-called-harvard-and-ordered-them-to-reverse-malias-suspension/","1502701298.0"
"Mueller Will Be Forced To Resign Over Pelosi Affair\nRobert Mueller’s steamy, 13-year affair with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is going to cost him more than a little bit of embarrassment and his marriage, according to a trusted source inside the Department of Justice. Mueller will also be forced to resign from his position as Special Prosecutor for the FBI, nullifying everything that investigator has uncovered as fruit of the poisonous tree.\n\nPelosi, who says her husband was well-aware of the affair, swears that Mueller was just a friend whose company she enjoyed on long, lonely working nights and weekends in Washington. The California “progressive” says her husband was afforded the same freedom to explore “pleasures of the flesh.” :\n\n“We’re not interested in defending our actions or our values as human beings.

She’ll hold that seat until she dies.\n\nMueller, on the other hand, is looking at a messy divorce, a public humiliation and the loss of his job. He’ll also go down in history as the man who had solid evidence against several Trump surrogates and allowed their cases to all be dismissed on a technicality.

"Trump Accuser Psychiatrist has NO LICENSE to Practice!\nU.S. National News\n\nDetails Category: U.S. National News Wednesday, 10 January 2018 10:11\n\nFor months, a woman purporting to be an expert in Psychiatry, has been unethically remotely diagnosing President Donald Trump, and has also been unethically publicly claiming he is emotionally unstable and thus unfit to be President. But a quick look into Dr. Bandy Lee shows she doesn't have a License to practice!\n\nAccording the http://psychiatry.yale.edu/people/bandy_lee.profile, this person\n\ntrained in medicine and psychiatry at Yale and Harvard Universities, and in medical anthropology as a fellow of the National Institute of Mental Health, she is currently on the faculty of Yale School of Medicine’s Law and Psychiatry Division. She served as Director of Research for the Center for the Study of Violence (Harvard, U. Penn., N.Y.U., and Yale), co-founded Yale’s Violence and Health Study Group (MacMillan Center for International Studies), and leads a project group for the World Health Organization’s Violence Prevention Alliance. She has consulted with the governments of Ireland and France, as well as California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York on violence prevention programming in prisons and in the community. She played a key role in initiating reforms at Rikers Island, New York City’s correctional facility known for extreme levels of violence.

"The Eclipse Is Racist Suggests The Atlantic\nThe Atlantic, a once-great magazine, has determined that Monday’s total eclipse of the sun fails to affect enough black people.\n\nThe Atlantic’s very lengthy essay on the failure of the eclipse to occur where a sufficient number of black people reside is entitled “American Blackout.” It clocks in at a remarkable 4,544 words and does not appear to be satire.\n\nConcerning “the Great American Eclipse,” Brooklyn Law School professor Alice Ristroph writes in the rapidly deteriorating magazine, “there live almost no black people” “along most of its path.”\n\nThe Atlantic’s longwinded law professor assures readers that “implicit bias of the solar system” is “presumably” not the cause of eclipse’s failure to affect enough black people.\n\n“Still, an eclipse chaser is always tempted to believe that the skies are relaying a message.”\n\nOregon, where the eclipse will first appear in the continental United States, “is almost entirely white.” “There are very few black Oregonians, and this is not an accident.” It’s totally on purpose in 2017, The Atlantic claims, because the Pacific Northwest state had a “racial exclusion” clause in its original 1857 constitution.\n\nThe Atlantic notes that the eclipse will then move toward Wyoming and Idaho, which also have very low populations of black people. (RELATED: Now America’s National Parks Are Racist)\n\nAfter an extensive discourse criticizing the U.S. Census, The Atlantic tells readers that the eclipse will travel through Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. In this section of its essay, The Atlantic manages to drop the names of Bruce Springsteen, Jesse James, Eminem, Chelsea Manning, Michael Brown and Howard Zinn (a shallow socialist writer panned even by most serious socialists).\n\n“There are too many damn facts,” The Atlantic also complains.\n\nAfter considerable whining about the Electoral College and the way Congress is organized, The Atlantic moves on to southern Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee. There’s substantial discussion of the Ku Klux Klan in this section — and, of course, slavery. (RELATED: New York Is Named After A Horrendous Slave Trader)\n\nHere, The Atlantic criticizes Abraham Lincoln for being too cautious with the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nNext, The Atlantic traces the path of the eclipse to “overwhelmingly white rural areas” in the Deep South. There’s much discussion of the Civil War and much talk about “the glib view” America’s commoners have concerning Civil War history. Dylann Roof, who murdered nine people in the name of white supremacy, rates a mention.\n\nIn its final paragraph, The Atlantic concludes that the United States is “still segregated” and has “debts that no honest man can pay.” Cryptically, the magazine suggests, “the strange path of the eclipse suggests a need for reorganization” of the entire American political system.\n\nThe Atlantic classifies its article about the path of the eclipse in the category of “science” even though nothing remotely approaching science appears in any of the 4,544 words.\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter.

"Rogue Amazon Drone Attempts To Deliver BOMB To White House\nSpecial Delivery: yet another reason not to trust the impending takeover of drones.\n\nAs drones have rose to prominence in the past several decades, they have been responsible for killing babies, drug trafficking, and tariff circumvention, to name a few.\n\nBut this time, drones–and Amazon–may have gone too far.\n\nAt approximately 3:30am on October 25th, 2017, a drone arrived at the White House loading dock bearing what appeared to be gifts. Though the Secret Service had been fast asleep at that point, President Donald J. Trump–known to eschew sleep in order to get more work, deals, and negotiations done with foreign entities.\n\nTrump approached the package skeptically, but tactfully. He had a feeling something was up–and he was right. Once the package was dropped off by the drone, an NFC chip hardwired into the bomb decoupled from the Amazon drone, effectively beginning a countdown of just five minutes. As soon as Trump realized what was in the package, he knew exactly what to do.\n\nKeeping his former military experience and general intelligence in mind, Trump is no stranger to disarming bombs. Sources close to Trump estimate between one and four seconds remaining on the bomb. In the nick of time, Trump was able to save both himself, as well as over two centuries of American history in one fell swoop.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of America? Naturally, our skepticism towards drones now has a more established provenance. Perhaps Trump will enact more policies and strip more regulations to ensure that drones have no place in our society, or maybe he’ll even go for Amazon and fine them. After all, if products aren’t made and sold in America, what’s the point?\n\nThis story will be updated as it develops.\n\nPlease follow and like us:","http://www.thedailychronicle.co.uk/2017/10/25/rogue-amazon-drone-attempts-deliver-bomb-white-house/","1508904000.0"
"7 Las Vegas Shooting Witnesses Now Dead Within 1 Month of Attack\n7 Las Vegas Shooting Witnesses Now Dead Within 1 Month of Attack\n\nOne month on from massacre and seven key eyewitnesses have been killed\n\n© Neon Nettle / Press 7 key witnesses from the Las Vegas shooting have been killed\n\nOne month on from the Las Vegas shooting massacre on October 1st, and we still have no satisfactory answers for horrific events that took place at the Route 91 Harvest music festival. The mainstream media has all but given up on reporting on the attacks, now that it seems as though the public has swallowed the 'lone wolf' shooter narrative, that claims Stephen Paddock acted alone in killing 59 people and injuring hundreds more. In the month that followed the incident, a staggering seven key witnesses have died in very suspicious circumstances. Of all of those seven people, every single one of them had something in common, other than being there during the shooting: They all had information on the attack that contradicted the 'official' narrative. What's even more suspicious is that four of those seven eyewitnesses had given accounts that stated there was more than one shooter, and others died before they had a chance to speak.\n\nAs the MSM and sits back, safe in the knowledge it pushed the failing 'lone wolf' shooter narrative onto the public, people who hold vital information about the actual events that took place are being silenced. One common thread between these seven people is that their version of events offers fresh insight into what really happened, and some of them were giving eyewitness statements that directly conflicted with the story being pushed by the mainstream media and law enforcement officials. Let's take a look at each of the dead witnesses one by one and examine their conflicting perspectives.\n\n© Facebook Dennis and Lorraine Carver died when they car veered off the road and exploded\n\nThe latest eyewitnesses to die was a married couple from California called Dennis and Lorraine Carver, whose car suddenly veered off the road outside their home and crashed into a gate. Their car exploded on impact and killed both of them instantly. READ MORE: Couple Who Witnessed Las Vegas Shooting Killed in Car Explosion After escaping from the Las Vegas attacks unharmed, they later told how they were lucky to be alive. Mrs. Carver described how her husband protected her from the 'shooters' by shielding them inside a beer refrigerator until it was safe to run. After they managed to escape successfully, Lorraine posted updates on Facebook to let friends and family know they made it out ok, saying: 'I think the shooters have gone' Other than saying there were 'shooters' during the attack, the Carvers weren't perhaps as vocal as some other witnesses, and you may just write their deaths off as a bizarre coincidence if it wasn't for the loss of Mr. Carver's phone...\n\nSuspicions were raised much further, when a week after the fatal crash, the couple's eldest daughter, Brooke Carver, received an item carrying memories of her 52-year-old father through the post. During the confusion of the shooting, he had lost his phone that was full of photos and videos from the night of the attack. His phone had somehow ended up in the FBI's possession, but a Las Vegas agent promised to ship the phone back to him. 'When we turned it on, all his photos and messages were still there,' Brooke said The question is though, why did the FBI take three weeks to return the phone? It has been widely reported that the phones and laptops of eyewitnesses were confiscated and wiped by the FBI, so why was Mr. Carver's phone returned seemingly intact? Brooke Carver says 'all his photos and messages were still there,' but how would she know if anything had been deleted, as she wouldn't have seen what was on the phone before the FBI had it. Could the Carver's have captured something they shouldn't have? Perhaps unknowingly? Remember, Dennis Carver lost his phone during the chaos of the massacre, so it's unlikely he would've reviewed his images and videos from the night as his phone was only returned a week after he was killed.\n\n© Neon Nettle 35-year-old Danny Contreras was killed after reporting he was chased by 2 gunmen\n\nIn the same week, the Carvers were killed, 35-year-old Danny Contreras was brutally executed in an abandoned house in Las Vegas. His body was found in a vacant home in the northeastern valley after a woman heard a man groaning from inside the building and raised the alarm. Police say Contreras was dead when they arrived to investigate at the 5800 block of East Carey Avenue, near North Nellis Boulevard, and had died as the result of several gunshot wounds. Mr. Contreras tweeted the day after the attacks saying he was 'lucky to be alive' after he was 'chased by two gunmen.' READ MORE: Las Vegas Shooting Witness Who Reported Being 'Chased by 2 Gunmen', Found Dead His social media post from his Twitter account, which has since been suspended by Twitter, that was shared several times said: 'Feeling lcky to be alive. cant beleive i got out of concert alive! 2 men chasing me with guns. not evry 1 so lcky.'\n\n© Twitter Danny Contreras said he was lucky to be alive after being chased by 2 gunmen\n\n© Neon Nettle Chad Nishimura was shot dead outside church after going missing for 2 weeks\n\nChad Nishimura was a valet worker from the Mandalay Bay hotel, who parked the suspected Las Vegas shooting gunman's car, and gave an interview saying Stephen Paddock was a 'normal guy' who 'didn't have many bags'. Nishimura gave a statement to ABC affiliate, KITV4 News, but the article was later pulled from the network's website. After his account was published, Nishimura disappeared and all of his social media accounts were deleted with his friends and coworkers saying he was 'totally unreachable'. After finally resurfacing two weeks after he vanished, the young hotel worker was shot dead outside a church in, what police claim looks like, a 'botched robbery.' READ MORE: Missing Las Vegas Shooting Witness Shot Dead Outside Church At the scene, churchgoers told police when they rushed outside after hearing the gunshot, they didn’t see any suspects or cars leaving the area.\n\n\n\nChad Nishimura's account seems to prove that Paddock didn't carry bags of heavy machine guns and other deadly weapons up to his room. One of the biggest gaps in the official story is how he couldn've taken all those weapons up to his room and remain completely undetected. Nishimura's report of 'normal guy' Paddock arriving at the hotel without much luggage totally scratches that theory.\n\n\n\n© Facebook 28-year-old Kymberley Suchomel gave a detailed statement that multiple shooters were firing weapons\n\n28-year-old Kymberley Suchomel is perhaps the most well-publicized death following the massacre. Suchomel managed to escape the massacre, at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, uninjured but made a public statement describing the attacks and how they were carried out by multiple gunmen that were firing weapons into the crowd. Her post on Facebook quickly went viral as it confirmed what many had already suspected: The mainstream media 'official' narrative that Stephen Paddock was a 'lone wolf' gunman was false. She said multiple gunmen were not only firing weapons in the crowd but chasing people and gunning them down. READ MORE: Las Vegas Shooting Witness Who Identified Multiple Shooters Found Dead About a week after she gave this account, she was found dead at her Apple Valley home. According to her grandmother Julie Norton, Mrs. Suchomel had died in her sleep, saying: 'I believe the stress from the shooting took her life.' Shortly after news of her death broke, evidence emerged that Kymberley Suchomel had been in touch with other Las Vegas survivors who had also witnessed multiple shooters. READ MORE: Las Vegas Shooting Witness Was Forming Group to Expose Cover Up When She Died She had been collaborating with other eyewitnesses with the intention of exposing the truth behind the shooting and shining a light on the mainstream media's cover-up of the events.\n\n© Neon Nettle John Beilman shot himself and his disabled daughter shortly after the FBI raided his home\n\nJohn Beilman was one of the first vital witnesses to die, in relation to the Las Vegas shooting, when he killed himself and his disabled daughter in a horrific murder-suicide. John Beilman was wanted for questioning by federal agents in connection with a communications device discovered in suspected shooter Stephen Paddock's hotel room. READ MORE: Key Witness in Las Vegas Shooting Kills Self and Daughter Following FBI Raid Investigators searched Beilman's Fairport home the day before he shot his severely disabled daughter and himself, according to sources close to the investigation.

"BREAKING: Hulu Cancels Michelle Wolf’s Standup Special After Disgustisting Attacks\nMichelle Wolf was hoping to use the White House Correspondents’ Dinner to promote her sure-to-be-terrible standup special due to be released on Hulu soon, but her plan backfired magnificently when she attacked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ looks.\n\nWolf compared Sanders to the monstrously ugly Aunt Lydia on the anti-Christian show The Handmaid’s Tale and said that the Press Secretary’s eyes were “smoky” in appearance — a reference to liberals’ claim that her face is (as Bill Maher put it) “as lopsided as a half-weighted fishing lure.”\n\nA statement put out by Hulu President Irwin R. Fletcher explains that “in light of recent remarks made by Michelle Wolf, we have elected to cancel the standup special” — a huge blow to the former Daily Show writer’s ego and income.\n\nWolf has been defending her disgusting remarks, but has not yet commented on the cancellation of the show she has spent so much time promoting.\n\nUnfortunately for her, her hatred of President Trump and the strong women who stand behind him clouded her vision of her goals and she has now ruined her career with pointless and stupid attacks that completely failed to earn her applause or laughter at the Trump hatefest the Correspondents’ Dinner has become.\n\nPerhaps now the #MeToo liberals will learn that hating President Trump and his allies is not only stupid, but it is costly.","https://dailyworldupdate.us/2018/04/29/breaking-hulu-cancels-michelle-wolfs-standup-special-after-disgustisting-attacks/","1524974400.0"

"Maine: House Democrats vote to allow female genital mutilation\n“By a final vote of 77-70, the House killed the FGM ban in a mostly party-line vote…Last week House Democrats passed a toothless bill that wouldn’t actually ban FGM.”\n\nWhy did they do this? Flagrant Islamopandering, trying to get the votes of Maine’s growing Somali Muslim community. FGM is mandated in Islamic law: “Circumcision is obligatory (for every male and female) (by cutting off the piece of skin on the glans of the penis of the male, but circumcision of the female is by cutting out the bazr ‘clitoris’ [this is called khufaadh ‘female circumcision’]).” — ‘Umdat al-Salik e4.3, translated by Mark Durie, The Third Choice, p. 64\n\nWhy is it obligatory? Because Muhammad is held to have said so: “Abu al- Malih ibn Usama’s father relates that the Prophet said: ‘Circumcision is a law for men and a preservation of honour for women.’” — Ahmad Ibn Hanbal 5:75\n\n“Narrated Umm Atiyyah al-Ansariyyah: A woman used to perform circumcision in Medina. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to her: ‘Do not cut severely as that is better for a woman and more desirable for a husband.’” — Abu Dawud 41:5251\n\nUnless and until its Islamic justifications, which everyone seems to want to cover up and deny, are addressed, FGM will never be eradicated. Anti-FGM movements will tell Muslim women (and men) about the health risks of FGM, and about how barbaric it is to work to deny women sexual pleasure and try to control them, and none of it will stop FGM. All that will wash over believers and what will be left will be the fact that it is justified in Islam — and that is the one thing the anti-FGM campaigners refuse to address. So they will, unfortunately, never succeed.\n\n“Maine House Democrats Vote to Allow Female Genital Mutilation,” Maine First Media, April 19, 2018 (thanks to Creeping Sharia):","https://www.jihadwatch.org/2018/04/maine-house-democrats-vote-to-allow-female-genital-mutilation/","1524506408.0"
"BREAKING: Hillary Clinton Killed Filming A Documentary In Missouri\nHillary Clinton was killed this afternoon when she attempted to “do her own stunt” while shooting a documentary about the 2016 election.

"Retired MI5 Agent Confesses On Deathbed: ‘I Killed Princess Diana’\nAn 80-year-old retired MI5 agent, John Hopkins, has made a series of astonishing confessions since he was released from hospital in London on Wednesday and told he has weeks to live. Hopkins claims to have been involved in 23 assassinations for the British intelligence agency between 1973 and 1999, including Princess Diana.\n\nMr. Hopkins, who worked for M15 for 38 years as an operative, claims he was often used as an hitman by the agency, to discreetly assassinate individuals considered a threat to the domestic security of the United Kingdom.\n\nTrained as both a mechanical engineer and munitions expert, Mr. Hopkins claims he also has extensive experience of less conventional methods of inflicting death and destruction, including chemicals and poisons.\n\nThe 80-year-old British man claims he was involved with MI5 assassinations between June 1973 and December 1999, during a period he says “the MI5 operated with less external oversight.” Hopkins says he was part of a cell of seven operatives who were trusted to carry out political assassinations across the UK. Most victims were politicians, activists, journalists and union leaders.\n\nMr. Hopkins says Princess Diana is unique among his victims, as she is the only female he ever assassinated, as well as the only Royal. She is also the only victim that the Royal Family themselves ordered to be taken out.\n\n[Banned Worldwide: Princess Diana Documentary ‘Unlawful Killing’. Must See.]\n\nHe claims to feel “ambivalent” about Princess Diana’s death. On the one hand, Diana was “a beautiful, kind-hearted woman” who did not deserve to have her life cut short. But according to Mr. Hopkins, she was also placing the British Crown at risk:\n\n“She knew too many Royal secrets. She had a huge grudge and she was going to go public with all sorts of wild claims. My boss told me she had to die – he’d received orders directly from Prince Philip – and we had to make it look like an accident. I’d never killed a woman before, much less a princess, but I obeyed orders. I did it for Queen and country.”\n\nThe next stage of the high-level conspiracy involved the media, under tight Palace control, talking to each other to “square their stories, make sure everybody was on the same page. It was a well run operation.”\n\n“British journalists all answer to editors who answer to oligarchs who all want knighthoods from the crime family at Buckingham Palace. There is no free press in Britain,” said Mr. Hopkins.\n\n“We got away with murder.”\n\nThe 80-year-old, spending his final weeks at home, said he expects to be taken into custody following his admissions, but says “I can’t say that I care an awful lot.” Hopkins explained that any investigation into the affair would “take forever” and be “very complicated” because there are few written records around secret MI5 activities and “most of my colleagues are already dead“.\n\nThe most important witness in the case, Mr. Hopkin’s boss, died of a heart attack in “the early 2000s” and the alleged ringleader, Prince Philip, “will never be charged with anything, of course“\n\n[Queen Elizabeth Ordered Princess Diana Murder Says Diana’s Best Friend]\n\n“If Prince Philip ever let himself be analyzed by a psychiatrist I’m sure he’d be diagnosed a psychopath.

"Saudi Arabia: Panel of Scientists admits Women are Mammals, yet ‘Not Human’\nRiyadh | In an unprecedented ruling, a panel of Saudi scientists has concluded that women are actually mammals, granting them the same rights as other mammal species such as camels, dromedaries and even goats.\n\nThe verdict, which fell just hours before the International Women’s Day, is considered “historic” by some experts and advocacy groups for women’s rights.\n\n“It may seem too little, too late, but it is truly a milestone event for all women in the region,” explains Jane Austin, visibly excited.\n\n“This is a great leap forward for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia” – Jane Austin, Women’s Liberation Action Network\n\n“From now on, women will be considered as members of the mammal class, whereas before women shared the legal status of an object, similar to that of a home appliance,” she admits.\n\n“Soulless objects”\n\nThe recent verdict could completely upset all laws currently enforced in Saudi Arabia believes Jillian Birch, a spokeswoman at Amnesty International.\n\n“This verdict shows the incredible progress the women’s rights movement has made in the past 50 years,” she admitted in a press conference this morning.\n\n“Finally, women will no longer be simply considered as objects without souls, but as full-fledged mammals, with the same rights as other animals of their species such as camels and goats,” she said, visibly emotional.\n\n“Women are still far from being considered 100% human, but their condition will improve drastically with this decision,” she firmly believes.\n\nAn unprecedented verdict\n\nThe verdict, which fell like a ton of bricks on the Saudi state, has clearly not found unanimous support amongst religious authorities and the political elite, concede experts.\n\n“It could create significant turmoil in the current legal state of affairs and the judiciary system of Saudi Arabia,” says political analyst specialized in the Middle East, Anthony Bochstein.\n\n“If women previously had the same rights as a chair or a table and were seen more as individual property, they now have an equivalent status to certain animal species, and thus must receive, at the very least, feeding, watering and be conferred a minimum of attention and respect, which was not the case previously,” he explains.\n\nAccording to the expert panel that ruled on the matter, women are still devoid of a soul but have been shown to possess qualities common to the mammal species, which would explain their ability to procreate and breastfeed, as well as why they are equipped with seven cervical vertebrae, a characteristic unique to the mammal species.","https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/saudi-arabia-panel-of-scientists-admits-women-are-mammals-yet-not-human/","1457446830.0"

"BREAKING: Sasha Obama Just Crashed Her Expensive New Car Into A Lake\nWhen Barack Obama bought his daughter Sasha a used Bugatti Veyron for Christmas, she apparently loved the new car so much that she immediately took it for a spin. Unfortunately, that car didn’t last long.\n\nThe former President* put his “hard-earned” speaking fees to work getting the car for his daughter, but it quickly became a $1.1 million piece of fish food when she picked up her friends and promptly crashed it into a lake. The Washington Times-Heraldreports:\n\nThe younger Obama daughter frantically called police after she apparently went too fast around a turn and drove her car off the road and into Lake Hope, about 32 miles outside of Washington, D.C. Officers noted a “strong smell of marijuana” in the crashed vehicle, but no drugs were found as the wreckage was searched. Sasha Obama was cited for reckless driving and released into her parents’ custody. Her three passengers, ages 15, 17, and 16, were also released into their parents’ custody. One was treated for “minor injuries” according to Washington Sheriff Donald Harland.\n\nForgetting for a moment how ironic an Obamacar sinking into Lake Hope is, why would any parent spend more than a million dollars on a car for a child who has just turned 16? Why was she allowed to drive it unsupervised. What if someone had been seriously hurt?\n\nAccording to police, Sasha Obama admits she was driving “more than 90 mph down Lake Hope Rd.” where the speed limit is 35.\n\nThe Obamas have no respect for America, but hopefully Sasha has learned a (expensive) lesson about speeding.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://defenseusa.site/2017/12/21/breaking-sasha-obama-just-crashed-her-expensive-new-car-into-a-lake/","1513832400.0"
"Information for the Nation\nHaven’t you noticed how cranky or irritable you are when you haven’t had a decent night’s sleep after a long time? Yes, sleep can brighten your mood and more. However, it doesn’t only do wonders for your emotional health—it also does great things for your overall well-being.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet are part of the process of getting to your ideal health, but it all starts with sleep. Here’s why you should change your opinion of sleeping as just resting a tired body.\n\nSleeping helps with Memory\n\nThose who lost a lot of time not sleeping in their childhood may suffer loss of memory in their old age. That’s because when we sleep, our minds become like computers; while we aren’t aware of it, it processes things we’ve done during the day when we awake. It’s how we master some things.\n\nSleep gives you ‘Immortality’\n\nWell, we do fall asleep when we die, but sleeping—or getting the required amount of sleep—helps us live longer. A study done on people between the ages of 50 and 80 revealed that six hours or more of sleep helps people live longer. Obviously, we also are more active and alert when we’ve gotten our required hours of sleep.\n\nSleep helps your Body heal\n\nWhen we get our required several hours sleeping, our body slows down and gets more rest. This also helps in curbing certain diseases. Problems with the heart, results like stroke, arthritis, and diabetes are only some of the possible problems the body faces when it lacks sleep over a long time.\n\nIdeally Creating Ideas\n\nWhen we get a good night’s rest, we become more alert. Our minds are more creative as well. Studies have pointed to sleep as an aid to repurposing your memories. Hence, when we get more sleep, we get more ideas as well, leading to more creativity in our activities.\n\n﻿\n\nWhen we get more sleep, we also get less cranky. This is better for all the people around us and for us, as we win more friends by sleeping—it’s like hitting two birds with one stone.","http://theseattletribune.com/6-dead-after-truck-collides-with-anti-trump-protesters-on-freeway/","None"
"BOOM: Roy Moore Takes The Military Vote, Pulls Ahead By 5K Votes\nThe Alabama Secretary of State’s Division Of Electoral Balloting Integrity has begun sending emails to media outlets regarding the military vote count in the Roy Moore vs. Doug Jones Senatorial race. RWR obtained a copy of the email sent to Breitbart, confirming that Roy Moore is in the lead:\n\nDear Ferdinand, In response to your question on the final count of provisional military ballots, the Secretary has instructed the Division of Electoral Balloting Integrity to inform you that with 97 percent of that vote counted, Justice Roy Moore now leads the race by 5014 votes. Please feel free to inquire about the final 3 percent, which is fewer than 400 votes and can’t possibly change the outcome at this point. Warmest regards, Bethany Marie Palmaranian\n\nWhat that means for the Jones campaign is that it will now be on them to ask for a recount and since the margin is more than .01573, he’ll have to pay for it himself. That could be a costly effort, estimated at nearly $213 million.\n\nThe Secretary of State’s office has already announced that the election won’t be certified until after the first of the year, so the Democrat loser will have plenty of time to decide if he’ll waste the taxpayers’ time and money with a fruitless recount.\n\nThey can never just admit when they lost.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://defense-usa.xyz/2017/12/15/boom-roy-moore-takes-the-military-vote-pulls-ahead-by-5k-votes/","1513314000.0"
"Pat Robertson: “Just Staring At Our First Lady Can Heal Gays”\nWhen Christian Conservative leader Pat Robertson discussed the RNC convention in his TV show “The 700 Club” last July, he managed once again to turn the topic to controversy surrounding Melania Trump’s speech. Robertson had agreed with many people when he said, “Trump’s speechwriter should be fired for doing – or borrowing a few lines from Mrs. Obama.” But then the televangelist got creepy when he started discussing Mrs. Trump’s appearance, when he said, “We mentioned the language in that speech, although she was absolutely gorgeous and I think that’s why they wanted to put her on. She had a beautiful dress and she’s a lovely lady. Trump knows when he’s got a winner.”\n\nLately, he’s been at it again. On the most recent episode of his show, the televangelist argued that the sole reason the mainstream media is targeting President Donald Trump is, once again, his wife. Robertson opined that the beauty of First Lady Melania Trump is so incredible that “just by staring at her for a period of time, one can rid themselves of the plague of homosexualism.” “You know how there used to be this urban myth that men can prolong their natural lives just by staring at naked female breasts for 10 minutes a day? Well, this is sort of something similar to that, with one crucial difference: it’s not an urban myth,” Robertson said. “She’s an actual gay whisperer, that one.”\n\nThe conservative TV host went on to say that that’s one of the main reasons why the mainstream media seems to have been targeting Donald Trump for the entire duration of his presidential campaign, as well as since he’s won the election. “Most of them are either on the Democrats’ payroll or they’re flat out owned by them,” he said. “And that’s why it comes as no surprise that 99 percent of the media powerhouses that are purporting to be democratic and for-the-people are actually the opposite. They’ve got their crosshairs on our president, and all because he’s scary good at picking out the women in his life. I’ve always said that gays are nothing more than straight people gone astray, and Melania Trump has the gift of steering them back on the path of righteousness.\n\n“Many people might be surprised by this, but I’m not saying all this simply because I choose to believe it; as a matter of fact, I speak from personal experience,” the host continued. “I was never gay, nor have I ever craved the companionship of another man for purposes other than camaraderie, but I’ve been keeping tabs of what the First Lady has been up to since she assumed office, and let me tell you – boy, there’s just something about that woman that could make a rich man weep and a heathen pray. Her aura is simply astonishing and there’s really no other way to put it that I know of. In fact, I would even go so far as to argue that she’s probably a significant part of the reason why Donald Trump won the presidential election. She’s managed to appeal to the men in America in a way that no other First Lady ever has.”\n\n“And for that reason and that reason alone, I would advise her to forget about doing her part in stopping Internet bullying of children or whatever her plan was upon assuming office. Instead, we need to build a rehab clinic or something and name it after her, something like, ‘Melania Trump’s Gay Rehab for American Boys and Men’ or something. And before anyone says anything – I’m well aware the abbreviation for that would be ‘Melania Trump’s GRABM.’ After all, it’s only fitting, since her husband has had his fair share of ‘grab ‘em’ incidents. But anyway, I mean, if Betty Ford got to have one, why shouldn’t another woman – one that’s, by all accounts, far more important for the survival of American men – be given the same privilege? And the best part would be the prescribed therapy: staring at naked pictures of the First Lady of the United States all day long. Heck – even I’d kiss a man just to be sentenced to that treatment,” Robertson concluded.","http://politicops.com/pat-robertson-media-trump-just-staring-first-lady-can-heal-gays/","1487356126.0"

"Denzel Washington: Trump’s Election Saved Us From ‘Orwellian Police State’\nDonald Trump’s election victory saved the United States from the establishment of an “Orwellian police state” in the hands of Democrats who would have used the same authoritarian tactics “over and over again” to “circumvent the will of the people in future elections,” according to Denzel Washington.\n\n“If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this.

"UPDATE: CBS News Video Misrepresents Florida School Shooting Timeline – Poor Editing Blamed (VIDEO)\nEditor’s Note: In an update to our original story, it appears a poor editing job by CBS News misrepresented comments made by Marjory Stoneman Douglas student David Hogg, making it appear as if he made contradictory statements about the mass shooting on February 14.\n\nOur initial story, included below, pointed out a major contradiction in statements made by Hogg to Time Magazine and CBS News. Although CBS has yet to comment, Redstate is reporting that CBS clipped video of a statement Hogg made of his actions on the day of the shooting. The edit made it appear as if Hogg was at home during the shooting, not at school, as he has repeatedly claimed.\n\nHogg has seen a number of outlandish conspiracy theories thrown his way, accusing him of not being a student and being a crisis actor. Those accusations have been discredited, but this error by CBS News will likely ignite a new series of conspiracy theories surrounding Hogg and the tragedy.\n\nThe video clip released by CBS News apparently failed to include Hogg’s statement that he had gone home after the shooting and returned later that evening, to interview students who had gathered outside of the school. Their edit made it appear as if Hogg was never at the school to begin with.\n\nFollowing is the original story:\n\nA new documentary by CBS News reveals that Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg, who has become the face of the student body’s push for gun control, was not at the school at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe bombshell comes from David Hogg himself, who made the admission to a CBS News interviewer as part of the documentary “39 Days.” The program chronicles the birth of the student-led “Never Again” movement that culminated in the “March for our Lives” in Washington D.C. on Saturday.\n\n“39 Days” has not yet aired, but an excerpt posted online by CBS News (and included below) includes interviews with the students leading the gun control movement, including Hogg, Delaney Tarr, Cameron Kasky, and Emma Gonzalez. Hogg, who describes himself as a “student journalist,” admits he was at home at the time of the shooting, but rode his bike to school to “get as many interviews as I could.”\n\nThat directly contradicts statements he gave to Time Magazine (included below) where he claims to have been in class at the time of the shooting.\n\nDAVID HOGG: On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.\n\nHogg does not elaborate as to why he was not at school at the time of the shooting.\n\nHe also admits that he did not know most of the students who were killed.\n\nDAVID HOGG: I didn’t know most of these people at a very personal level, but I wanted to make their voices heard and that’s what I’m really trying to do.\n\nThe new claim that he was at home contradicts his interview with Time Magazine just days after the shooting, in which Hogg said he was in class.\n\nWhen Hogg heard a “pop” while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a “Code Red” exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned. And then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitor—Hogg doesn’t know his name but calls him an angel—knew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hogg—who’s an editor at the school’s TV station—found the news that the shooting was real and ongoing. The shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day. “While I was in there, I thought, ‘What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here?’” Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. “And the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, that’s all I could think: Get other people’s stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and that’s how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about.”\n\nCBS News did not challenge Hogg on his contradictory statements, and Hogg himself has not explained the contradiction.\n\nHogg’s statement can be seen just past the 4:30 mark of the video clip below.\n\nPost your thoughts in the comments section below on the admission by David Hogg. In addition, share this on social media.","https://silenceisconsent.net/cbs-news-bombshell-marjory-douglas-student-leader-wasnt-at-school-on-day-of-the-mass-shooting-video/","1522060281.0"
"CIA Agent Confesses On Deathbed: ‘I Killed Bob Marley’\nA 79-year-old retired officer of the CIA, Bill Oxley, has made a series of stunning confessions since he was admitted to the Mercy Hospital in Maine on Monday and told he has weeks to live. He claims he committed 17 assassinations for the American government between 1974 and 1985, including the music icon Bob Marley.\n\nMr. Oxley, who worked for the CIA for 29 years as an operative with top-level security clearances, claims he was often used as a hitman by the organization, to assassinate individuals who could represent a threat to the goals of the agency.\n\nTrained as a sniper and marksman, Mr. Oxley also has significant experience with more unconventional methods of inflicting harm upon others, like poisons, explosives, induced heart attacks and cancer.\n\nThe 79-year-old operative claims he committed the assassinations between March 1974 and August 1985, at a time when he says the CIA “was a law unto itself.” He says he was part of an operative cell of three members which carried out political assassinations across the country and occasionally in foreign countries.\n\nMost of their victims were political activists, journalists, and union leaders, but he also confesses to assassinating a few scientists, medical researchers, artists and musicians whose ideas and influence “represented a threat to the interests of the United States.”\n\nHe claims he had no problem with going through with the assassination of Bob Marley, because “I was a patriot, I believed in the CIA, and I didn’t question the motivation of the agency. I’ve always understood that sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good.”\n\nBut Mr. Oxley confesses that Bob Marley remains unique among his victims, as he was the only victim he “felt anything for.”\n\n“The others were assholes. Bob Marley was Bob Marley. I was no closer to being a long-haired hippy back then than I am now, but I must admit Bob’s music did move me. It held some power over me.”\n\nHe claims to have “mixed feelings” about Bob Marley’s death. On the one hand, Marley was “a good man, a beautiful soul” with “profound artistic gifts” who did not deserve to have his life cut short. But according to Mr. Oxley, Bob Marley was also placing the goals of the CIA in jeopardy and threatening the existence of the United States:\n\n“He was succeeding in creating a revolution that used music as a more powerful tool than bullets and bombs. Bob Marley in 1976 was a very serious threat to the global status quo and to the hidden power brokers implementing their plan for a new world order. As far as the agency was concerned, Bob Marley was too successful, too famous, too influential… A Jamaican Rastaman who started using his funds and fame to support causes around the world that were in direct conflict with the CIA… To be honest, he signed his own death warrant.”\n\n“It’s not like we didn’t warn him. We sent a few guys to shoot up his house in Kingston,” Mr Oxley says, referring to a shooting in the Marley residence that left the singer with an injured arm and chest. “We had a message for him. We impressed upon him the gravity of the situation he found himself in. He didn’t listen.”\n\n“Two days later, in the mountains, I stuck him with the pin.“\n\nHow Bob Marley was murdered by the CIA\n\nTwo days after Bob Marley was shot in the left arm by one of three gunmen who ambushed the singer and some of his crew in his house in Kingston, and after a brief stint in hospital, Bob Marley travelled to the protective hills of the Blue Mountains and spent time at the highest point in Jamaica, rehearsing for an upcoming concert.\n\nAccording to Mr. Oxley, he used press credentials to gain access to Bob Marley during his Blue Mountains retreat. He introduced himself as a famous photographer working for the New York Times, and gave Bob Marley a gift.\n\n“I gave him a pair of Converse All Stars. Size 10. When he tried on the right shoe, he screamed out ‘OUUUCH.‘\n\n“That was it. His life was over right there and then. The nail in the shoe was tainted with cancer viruses and bacteria. If it pierced his skin, which it did, it was goodnight nurse.”\n\n“There had been a series of high-profile assassinations of counter-culture figures in the United States in the late sixties, early seventies. By the time Bob Marley’s time came around, we thought subtlety was the order of the day. No more bullets and splattered brains.”\n\nMr. Oxley says he kept close contact with Marley during the final years of his life, ensuring the medical advice he received in Paris, London and the United States “would hasten his demise rather than cure him.” He died from cancer in May 1981. He was just 36 years old.\n\n“The last time I saw Bob before he died he had removed the dreadlocks, and his weight was dropping like a stone,” he says.\n\n“He was very withdrawn, unbelievably small. He was shrinking in front of us. The cancer had done it’s job.”\n\n“The day he died in Miami was definitely one of the most difficult moments in my career. I felt real bad. For a long time I wasn’t comfortable with my part in his death. But eventually I came to realize it had to be done, for America.”","http://yournewswire.com/cia-agent-deathbed-bob-marley/","1512060960.0"
"Pastor Scarborough: “God Would Cure Breast Cancer If Our Women Stopped Having Dirty Fantasies”\nIn yet another example of what the Religious Right’s recent focus on “religious liberty” is really about, five Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to speak at a “religious freedom” event hosted by a conservative pastor who has repeatedly declared that AIDS is God’s punishment for gay people’s “immoral act” and has called for a “class action lawsuit” against homosexuality.\n\nJust last year, Vision America’s Rick Scarborough repeated his belief that AIDS is “God’s judgment on a sinful generation,” adding that “God would probably give us the cure for AIDS today” if the U.S. stopped supporting gay rights.\n\nCommenting on the preparations for the event, Scarborough used the same pitch, only this time to refer to the fact that “U.S. women seem to be having a lot of dirty fantasies and that’s why God has also decided it would be a good idea to give them breast cancer so they could learn from their sins.” “You know, we’ve seen this happen before, and I’ve said it right from the start – He is watching everything and He sees everything, you just can’t hide anything from Him,” he added.\n\nScarborough opined: “You’re going to have people who say, ‘God works in mysterious ways.’ Well, I have to say, to me, the Big Guy’s M.O. is pretty straightforward. It’s all about cause and consequence. First we had gays running rampant on Earth, so He took a look at that and decided we should have AIDS. Then, he saw some other abomination walking on the very planet that he built, so again he decided it was time for some punishment. And now, we have this – a situation where American women can’t get enough of dirty fantasies. You’ve got rape, kidnapping, incarceration, BDSM, anal, masturbation, you name it and our women are fantasizing about it. And sure enough, He’s watching closely. Why do you think we have breast cancer? Because He’s sick of what he’s seeing.”\n\n“But the best part about it, and the thing that we are obviously too stubborn to realize,” the activist added, “is He is more than willing to forgive. He will always offer you a clean slate and a fresh start, no matter how sinful you’ve become. All we need to do now, all we need to do to help our women be better and more virtuous, is make them stop having dirty fantasies.” As if that wasn’t enough, Scarborough also stated his theory on how the deed should be done: “I can’t say from personal experience, but I’ve heard that talking to women never works because they’re too stubborn. Beating the living daylights out of them is another way to go, and that’s what I’d recommend. I think every single woman who has dirty fantasies should be beaten and beaten well. Then and only then will God even consider giving us the cure for breast cancer.”\n\n“And another thing,” Scarborough added. “I’m pretty sure that therapy by beating might also work on a certain percentage of the gay population. I’m not sure what percentage, since a number of them probably loves to be roughed up during their filthy intercourse anyway, but it might prove to be a positive form of physical therapy after all.”","http://politicops.com/pastor-scarborough-god-would-cure-breast-cancer-if-our-women-stopped-having-dirty-fantasies/","1452960500.0"
"Rubio: “Rape Victims Should Be In Custody If There Is Suspicion That They’re Planning Abortion”\nAt a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with “radical” positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking – I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That’s what I believe,” declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. “I believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that’s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,” Rubio asserted.\n\n\n\nTaking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would “put rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.”\n\n“I’m just totally against the whole shebang, I won’t deny it,” Rubio said. “I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on.”\n\nHe added: “That is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.”\n\nAsked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: “Don’t know yet, first thing’s first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.”/SOURCE\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/05/23/rubio-rape-victims-custody-suspicion-theyre-planning-abortion/","1495512000.0"
"Scientists Miscalculate, Solar Eclipse Actually Next Year\nHOUSTON, TX — After double-checking their math, scientists have announced that the total lunar eclipse predicted for August 21, 2017, will occur August 3, 2018.\n\n“Due to a computational mishap, the eclipse we projected for later this month will actually take place late next year,” stated NASA astrophysicist Dr. Theodore Moneta at a hastily-planned press conference from Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We were a bit off.”\n\nDr. Moneta explained that in calculating the date of the eclipse, scientists utilized a complex formula involving geocentric ephemeris for the Sun and Moon, various parameters, constants, and the Besselian elements, but along the way an error went unnoticed.\n\n“In layman’s terms, we forgot to carry the one,” explained Moneta, a mistake that has plagued 12-year-olds in 7th grade math for centuries.\n\n“This is an embarrassing day for both science and mathematics,” he added.\n\nFor officials in those states situated within the eclipse’s path of totality preparing for an influx of visitors in the next few weeks, the NASA announcement came as a shock.\n\n“It’s disappointing,” stated Matt Mead, governor of Wyoming, upon hearing the news. “Obviously, the NASA nerds really dropped the ball on this one.”\n\nHowever, Mead felt that Wyoming would be less affected by the altered date than other locales due the Cowboy State’s inherent awesomeness.\n\n“A visit to our state is spectacular with or without a once-in-lifetime astronomical occurrence,” said Mead. “Wyoming doesn’t need an eclipse to shine.”\n\nUse ECLIPSE18 for 18% off your order at adventurewyoming.com!\n\nDisclaimer: This article is satirical in nature.

"Illegal Alien Charged With California Wildfire That Killed 40 People\nSONOMA COUNTY, CA (Breitbart) – The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.\n\nBreitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.\n\nSargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years.

"Latest Dead Body Tied To The Clintons Turns Up Valuable Evidence\nAnother body found in a shallow grave in Arkansas has been tied to the Clintons. Marcia Ann Bosley, who was the head housekeeper at the Governor’s Mansion before she was mysteriously let go in 1985, has been positively identified after spending more than 3 decades in the ground.\n\nBosley, who had no family when she was let go, was assumed to have left the area for other opportunities. She was never reported missing. According to the Hamilton County Coroner:\n\n“The body was wrapped so well in plastic thast much of the tissue is still intact. We were able to extract 2 DNA samples. We’ve determined that one was an unborn child.

According to the US Marshal’s Service, Weiner has been taken into protective custody and placed in a safe house until he can testify against Hillary Clinton and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin.\n\nWeiner, whose laptop was seized over a sex scandal last year, was found to be in possession of eleventy thousand top-secret emails that could have brought America to its knees had they fallen into enemy hands. The emails were found to have been copied directly from Hillary Clinton’s private server.\n\nWeiner, in a sworn federal affidavit, claimed that the emails were put there by Abedin to protect Clinton and that if he didn’t keep his mouth shut he would be “joining Vince Foster.” Clinton is expected to be charged with corruption, murder and perjury at some point in 2017. Congressman Trey Gowdy has just ordered another $11 million in investigations to seal the deal.\n\nAfter he testifies, Weiner will enter the witness protection program. Sources inside the Marshal’s service say he has already requested plastic surgery on both his face and his junk so there’s no chance he could be recognized should his texting addiction see a relapse.

"Looks like Sheriff David Clarke’s “army” medals might be B.S.\nDavid Clarke, the controversial sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin and staunch Donald Trump supporter, has reportedly accepted an offer to become the next assistant deputy secretary of Homeland Security. While the DHS itself is casting some doubts on the posting, the reactions to his proposed appointment are, for the most part, negative.\n\nIn the wake of that, an interesting charge against Clarke surfaced in the form of a Twitter rant on Thursday.\n\nAt almost all of his public appearances, Clarke either wears a pristine cowboy hat with a natty suit or, more famously, a uniform festooned with shiny military medals. On Thursday, Twitter user Charles Clymer, an army veteran, pointed out that those military medals might not be all that legit.\n\n'Look at this fucking guy's uniform,' Clymer said, in the second of a long string of tweets on the subject. 'You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket? That's not supposed to be there.'\n\nClymer went on to break down each individual medal, their placement and their apparently spurious provenance. Clymer acknowledged that legitimate medals are earned, and should be worn with pride, but accuses Clarke of 'stolen valor' and calls Clarke's collection, 'a sloppy assortment of badge replicas arranged neatly, [that] looks imposing.'\n\nHe goes on to say that the way Clarke wears his medals seems more like something, 'a fucking 10 year-old does. And I know because I was 10 and did this with a pin collection one day. Stupid fun.'\n\nClymer also tweeted that he reached out to the Milwaukee Police Department, to get a copy of their uniform standards to back up his claims, but has not heard back.\n\nRead the full twitter rant below:\n\n1/ Okay, regarding Sheriff David Clarke, can I be petty for a second about something that's always irritated me?

"Ariana Grande Massacre: Authorities ‘Rehearsed’ Attack Weeks Before\nAuthorities knew about plans for the radical Islamic terror attack at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, UK that targeted young girls and teenagers, according to reports.\n\nBritish intelligence and law enforcement were aware of plans to kill as many people as possible at the O2 Arena in Manchester, but rather than apprehend the terrorist, they let him kill 19 people, and the death toll may yet rise.\n\nBritain’s open borders have provided the elite with the useful terrorists necessary to do their dirty work for them. British intelligence and law enforcement ‘allowed’ this attack to happen in order to justify cracking down on the innocent population even further, taking away more and more civil liberties, until we are living in a police state.\n\nThe terrified public will allow this to happen. They will choose “safety” over liberty.\n\nThe fact is, the ISIS death cult is funded and supported by the United States and its western allies. This is not a wild conspiracy theory. It is admitted by Democrat and Republican members of Congress in the United States.\n\nJust as ISIS cause death and destruction in Syria, Iraq and Libya on the US and European dime, they also cause chaos in large European cities. This is all part of the plan to destabilize Europe and take away civil liberties, privacy and the right to a decent life.\n\nThe Manchester attack has eery similarities to the Paris attacks of November 2015. Paris and Manchester are both dominoes that fell, as orchestrated by the New World Order, as part of a masterplan that aims to destroy Europe as we know it.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility immediately after the attack, just as they did after the Paris attacks, warning that it is “just the beginning.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StockMonsterUSA/status/866814657943674880\n\nTwitter needs to be working with police to identify this ISIS goat fucker – who reportedly was tweeting about the attack hours before. pic.twitter.com/KplZaYqE94 — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) May 23, 2017\n\nLess than two weeks after RT posted footage of crisis actors preparing for a terrorist attack in Manchester, a radical Islamic terrorist carried out a bloody attack on young girls, and it was allowed to happen.\n\nTerrorists are walking freely into our countries and being allowed to perform barbaric acts that terrorize good, law-abiding citizens.

Lambert, 54, of Maryland, was charged with 'one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering,' the DOJ said in a statement.\n\nThe charges are connected to the alleged bribery scheme that involves 'Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.'\n\nTENEX is the commercial sales arm for Russia's Rosatom, which took full control of Uranium One in 2013.\n\nA report from October revealed that federal agents started collecting evidence in 2009 about Russian officials that were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering connected to the Uranium One deal:\n\nFederal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.

Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin’s commercial nuclear ambitions.\n\nIn December, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that prosecutors at the DOJ start 'interviewing FBI agents about evidence they uncovered in a criminal investigation into a highly-controversial uranium deal that involves Bill and Hillary Clinton.'","https://www.dailywire.com/news/25828/breaking-indictment-handed-out-russian-bribery-ryan-saavedra#/","1515819060.0"

Nearly hunted to extinction by 1950, alligators were one of the first protected species in 1962. They helped usher in the creation of the Endangered Species Preservation Act in 1966 and by 1987, the alligator had become a rousing success story, pronounced fully recovered. With healthy levels returned, they demonstrated the program’s effectiveness and future promise.\n\nToday, in some parts of Louisiana, the American alligator’s story is experiencing another plot twist: It’s seeing a revival in upscale restaurants.\n\nChef Nathan Richard of Cavan in New Orleans is both passionate and creative when it comes to cooking alligator — he’s done nose-to-tail preparations and hosted a vanishing wetlands supper series.

Fried alligator tenderloin was slathered in a coconut sauce, made from hot red curry, fish sauce, soy, sliced ginger and gochujang paste. It was fragrant and spicy, bringing both moments of classic Louisiana flavor with intense notes of Southeast Asian cuisine. A perfectly crackled exterior resembled fried chicken, but the meat within was more akin in consistency to a super-tender octopus.\n\nThe interior at Cavan Sara Essex Bradley\n\nWhile Richard is not the only man cooking gator in New Orleans, he’s likely one of the few chefs of his caliber with such a hands-on approach to the animal in the wild.\n\nBoating through the bayou in Louisiana Jenny Adams/Mic\n\n“I’ve been hunting alligator since I was a kid growing up in Thibodaux, Louisiana,” he said. “Alligator is not only high-protein and low-fat, it’s also able to be sustainably sourced. The way we trap them, there’s no pain or stress until the moment it’s killed. If you do it right, it’s very, very fast.”\n\n“And if you do it wrong?” I asked.\n\n“If you hunt alligator wrong, you’re in big trouble,” he said with a laugh. The sound fits his massive frame — when he’s not hunting gator, Richards is a volunteer fireman.\n\nA photo posted by (@) on\n\nHis exploration of new ways to cook alligator continues to excite guests who’ve come to love the meat. It’s far beyond fried alligator bites in a basket — a common sight in the city.\n\n“I learned from Australian crocodile recipes that you can do a baby-back ribs,” he said. “When I worked at Kingfish, I hosted nose-to-tail dinners. For those, I broke down an entire alligator and prepared each part differently. The cheek is delicious, but the liver is totally inedible.” His grits and alligator grillades arrived on the Cavan menu this winter, with pan-fried cutlets cooked in bacon fat and braised in a reduction of celery, onions, bell pepper and garlic — served over stone-ground, mascarpone and edam cheese grits.\n\nChef Nathan Richard at Cavan Cavan\n\nI was eager to get a more up-close-and-personal look at the wetlands, and, admittedly, at the alligators. It turns out a lot of people are similarly inclined and hunting (with professionals) is now a tourism activity.\n\nRichard has become friends with a biologist and conservationist, Ray J. Matherne, the owner of Cypress Point — 1,700 acres of wetland about 30 minutes from New Orleans in Bayou Des Allemands. Matherne has a Masters in environmental science from Loyola University and a doctorate in science education from the University of Southern Mississippi. Today he takes guests on tours and crawfish harvests. In September — the only month alligator hunting is legal — he’ll even take guests on two-day alligator hunts. There’s no place to stay directly on his property, but the drive isn’t too long from New Orleans. Matherne said he believes Cypress Point is over-populated by alligators, and he believes hunting the animals is necessary to control population.\n\nBut according to the National Wildlife Federation, alligator over-population is not a problem. “The rebound of the alligator populations is a conservation success story,” Samantha Carter, the senior outreach coordinator for the National Wildlife Federation, said in an email. “I am not sure anyone would say that they are overabundant or over-populated.”\n\nFor Carter, coastal restoration is the priority “because it will protect the freshwater habitat that alligators live in.” Bringing exposure to the issues of the wetlands through the return of the American alligator as a normalized protein, as well as tourism activities and wetland-focused dinners, could help.\n\nThe wetlands at Cypress Point Jenny Adams/Mic\n\nMatherne’s preserve has Spanish moss dripping dreamily off cypress, gum and oak trees. It’s easy to forget we are here for a hunt, as the first day is rather relaxing. We set traps using 12-foot long willow poles with a long, nylon rope tied to both ends. The poles are planted at a 45-degree angle deep into the mud. On the top of each pole, a piece of raw chicken hangs from a massive, metal hook dangling about a foot off the water.\n\nThe alligators begin their own hunt at dusk. Sniffing the rotten meat, they burst from the water to swallow the it whole, settling on the mud below to digest — without noticing that they’ve swallowed a hook and line, too.\n\nThe alligators from the hunt before they are processed Jenny Adams/Mic\n\n“Let’s say we never came back,” said Matherne on the second day of our hunt. “It would do them no harm. An alligator’s digestive system is so acidic, it’s strong enough to dissolve a hubcap. In a matter of days, it would all dissolve, and the alligator would swim away.”\n\nA missing chicken alerts us we might have a gator. Richard stands in the boat, hauling the pole and line upward. Another hunter stands alongside him with a rifle pointed at the water. It’s mere seconds before an 11-foot alligator rises to the surface, suddenly furious and thrashing. The water is boiling and the boats are rocking with considerable force. Birds go screaming from the tree canopy. If you need anything to hunt an alligator, I realize, it’s an incredible trifecta of balance, bravery and marksmanship, since falling in would likely mean death. A quick bullet is fired into the center of alligator’s the head, and just like that, the swamp goes quiet again.\n\nAfter hunting, we drive the gators in trucks to a licensed processor in Des Allemands. “I’m certainly not the only chef working with it in New Orleans,” said Richard. “I’d suggest dining at Pêche, where chef Ryan Prewitt uses alligator from time to time. I’d really love to see alligator go from being something people feel adventurous eating to something they feel normal eating again.”\n\nJan. 23, 2018, 5:22 p.m.: This article has been updated to remove inaccurate information regarding the population of alligator in the Louisiana wetlands. As Snopes and others pointed out after this article’s publication, the state of Louisiana does not currently consider the alligator to be over-populated.

"Canada Legalizes Euthanasia For Parents To Kill Their Disabled Kids\nDoctors in Canada have been given the green-light to euthanise disabled, sick or dying children under a controversial new law.\n\nThe legislation extends existing ‘assisted suicide’ laws that have been legal in Canada over a year now, in which adults can legally volunteer to end their own life.\n\nThe new legislation passes the responsibility of consensual death for minors over to the parents.\n\nLiftsitenews.com reports: American anti-euthanasia activist Wesley Smith said the results of the survey prove the morally slippery slope that a nation slides down when it agrees that “killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering.”\n\n“Once euthanasia consciousness is unleashed, it never stops expanding,” he wrote in the National Review.\n\n“I guess Robert Latimer–a Canadian farmer who murdered his daughter because she had cerebral palsy–was a visionary,” he added.\n\nThe CPS surveyed its members in light of the possibility Canada will expand euthanasia to children.\n\nIndeed, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government wrote that possibility into the law it passed in June 2016.\n\nBill C-14 permits voluntary euthanasia for individuals of at least 18 years of age assessed to be suffering intolerably from a grievous and irremediable medical condition, and with natural death reasonably foreseeable.\n\nBut the Commons Justice Committee added an amendment to the bill directing the federal government to review expanding euthanasia on three further grounds: for children, or “mature” minors; solely for mental illness; and allowing advance directives in the case of those with degenerative diseases such as dementia.\n\nThe Liberals have asked the Council of Canadian Academics to research these questions, and report to Parliament by the end of 2018.\n\nThe CPS surveyed 1050 pediatricians on their experiences with “medical aid in dying” or MAID, and released a report at the end of October.\n\nForty-five doctors reported receiving explicit requests from parents to euthanize 91 children, it said. More than half of these requests were for “neonates or infants under a year old.”\n\nA further 118 pediatricians had “exploratory” discussions about euthanasia with parents of 419 children.\n\nAs for requests from the children themselves, 35 paediatricians reported discussing euthanasia with 60 minors. Nine reported receiving direct requests for euthanasia from 17 minors.\n\nWhile “such consultations may be rare, minors in Canada are contemplating MAID-related concepts and approaching health care providers with MAID-related questions,” noted the CPS survey.\n\n“Given the evolving legislative landscape, it is reasonable to anticipate that such questions will increase in the near future.”\n\nThe CPS also conducted an attitude survey on euthanasia, with 574 of a possible 1,979 members, or 29 percent, responding.\n\nOf these, 46 percent supported euthanizing mature minors who have “progressive or terminal illness or intractable pain.”\n\nThirty-three percent opposed euthanizing mature minors for any reason.\n\nMature minors are children who are allegedly capable of understanding the nature and consequences of treatment, and so judged competent to request death by lethal injection.\n\nThe CPS study suggested non-voluntary euthanasia for non-competent dying “and/or severely disabled” children is not far off.\n\nCanada’s federal law, and Quebec’s law currently prohibit involuntary euthanasia for anyone, it said, adding:\n\nHowever, given the human rights framework advanced in Carter v. Canada, the parents of a dying and/or severely disabled child who is deemed to be suffering may, in the near future, be looking to the courts to support a right to end their child’s life. Decision-making for treatment of never-competent children is based on the “best interest standard”: choosing among options that reasonable persons, acting in good faith on another’s behalf, would consider acceptable in similar circumstances.\n\n“All this is very problematic,” says Alex Schadenberg, executive director of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition.\n\nEuthanasia lobbyists shift the argument for legalizing the killing of children by lethal injection from the autonomy of the individual to “why do you want to allow them to suffer,” he told LifeSiteNews.\n\n“So the idea is, well, this isn’t fair, the law has an inequality because you’re allowing adults who are capable of requesting this, but not children or mature minors.”\n\nParents and guardians in Canada currently can authorize no treatment or the withdrawal of treatment for non-competent minors, Schadenberg added.\n\n“If you had a child with a significant disability, then the question at birth would be, do you want that child to receive treatment or not, and you would have the right to say yes or no,” he said.\n\n“So the argument is well, because we already have that, therefore, what’s the difference between that” and euthanasia.\n\nSchadenberg echoed Smith’s warning that once euthanasia is allowed, the grounds for legally killing people keep expanding, as has been demonstrated in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe Netherlands adopted the Groningen Protocol in 2004, he pointed out.\n\nIt gives doctors impunity to lethally inject disabled infants, such as those spinal bifida or hydrocephalus.\n\nThe CPS study “shows us that the parents were the ones to ask about euthanasia. Rarely did the mature minor or child consider euthanasia,” Schadenberg said.\n\n“The concept of euthanasia for children should be simply rejected based on the fact that children cannot consent.”","http://yournewswire.com/canada-euthanasia-disabled-kids/","1511371218.0"
"Queen Elizabeth Suspends Wedding After Meghan Markle Calls Herself ‘Liberal Activist’\nMeghan Markle’s “game-playing and histrionics” over the Christmas weekend left such a bad taste in Queen Elizabeth’s mouth that she has forced the future princess to sign a prenuptial agreement with Prince Harry – or else the wedding is off.\n\nThe problem with Meghan Markle is that she still insists on calling herself an “activist” on her Twitter page, and she is a noted hater of the President of the United States. That could be overlooked if she would “stop spreading divisive ideology” on her Twitter page and instead “keep a dignified silence on political matters“, but her “unsuitable” behavior over the Christmas weekend has left Buckingham Palace “concerned.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s eyebrows were first raised after Meghan Markle created a “fake racism scandal” by having a member of her increasingly sizable entourage leak a story to the press about Queen Elizabeth’s first cousin.\n\nAs previously reported, “The Hollywood celebrity gossip outlet, Page Six, has decided Queen Elizabeth’s cousin, Princess Michael of Kent, intentionally wore a ‘horrendously racist brooch’ to meet Prince Harry’s finance, Meghan Markle. There is no doubt this story was leaked by Markle’s ‘people,’ thus she approved it.”\n\nThe claim that the brooch was racist was a completely bogus accusation, concocted by Meghan Markle to mark her territory in the Royal Family and create a scandal in order force the British Royal Family to change their Christmas traditions.\n\nIn fact, Blackamoor art is not racist, and the brooch in question depicts a black king or royalty. Unconfirmed reports say the brooch represents the Blackmoor “Wise Man” who visited the Christ child, and Princess Michael noted she has worn the exact brooch at Christmas time on many times without incident.\n\nMad World reports: Regardless, the entire episode turned into a nightmare for the Queen, who as head of the British royal family and, as the monarch, was pressured by the mainstream media in America and England to “apologize.” She refused, which was met with cheers by the public, who saw through the whole fake “racism” claim concocted by the Meghan Markle camp.\n\nThis left the Queen, who must personally approve of all royal marriages, “quite upset“. The British monarch has lived through her share of royal divorces, and this “racism” claim left a bad taste in her mouth. It also set off “warning bells” about Markle’s behavior, so she told her grandson to “either get a prenuptial agreement or no marriage.”\n\nOK! magazine reports that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had their “first fight” after Markle felt “insulted” over a prenup. According to the story and an alleged inside source, the engaged couple is moving ahead with wedding planning, but they hit a major hurdle over the prenup.\n\nReferring to the report in OK!, MSN adds, “The magazine reports that Queen Elizabeth has seen ‘too many royal marriages end in divorce’ and doesn’t want her grandson to ‘take any chances with his reported $40 million fortune.’ That’s led to tension between the spouses-to-be, with a source sharing, ‘Meghan can see where the queen is coming from, but at the same time, she’s insulted that it would even cross the queen’s mind that Meghan would have an ulterior motive for marrying Harry.‘”\n\nAccording to the publication, the insider claims that the actress “loves Harry, and money is the last thing on her mind.” However, it also adds that “Queen Elizabeth is nonetheless pressuring her heir to make sure the family’s money is protected,” and consequently, “that means Prince Harry and Markle are clashing over the situation.”\n\nWhile some question the legitimacy of unnamed “inside sources,” others confirm that Markle, who went on the record calling President Donald Trump a “misogynist,” is livid that she would have to sign a prenup and claim that staffers inside the residence allegedly added that they heard the actress “letting Harry have it.”\n\nMarkle, who enjoyed moderate success on a TV series called “Suits,” is divorced from film producer Trevor Engleson, a marriage that lasted only 48 months, and her maid of honor has since shared some startling information.\n\nDesigner Ninaki Priddy, who was maid of honor at Markle’s wedding in Jamaica to Trevor, revealed how her friendship with Meghan ended. “What came to light after Trevor and I spoke ended my friendship with Meghan. I think everybody who knew them both was in shock,” she said, according to the Sun, adding, “All I can say now is that I think Meghan was calculated, very calculated, in the way she handled people and relationships,” describing Markle as “cold.”\n\nIt looks like the Queen is spot on about requiring a prenup agreement. If Markle cared nothing about money, then there would be no reason to scream at anyone, much less the man who is her future husband and sixth in line to the throne.\n\nThe entire bogus racism episode is looking more like a stunt to show the Queen that Harry’s fiance is willing to play games the British monarch won’t like to see made public. Well, as we said before, Markle and her merry band of leftist snowflakes are in way over their head. Elizabeth II is as astute as President Donald Trump, and these liberal losers are outclassed, outsmarted, and out of their league with this Queen.","http://yournewswire.com/queen-elizabeth-wedding-markle/","1514404328.0"

According to Noonan:\n\n“The three of them sat like old friends and discussed strategies and made treaties. Clinton’s crimes were to be set aside until his wife finished 2 terms of working with Republicans to shore up the base and ‘move away from these Trump loving racists’ as Ryan put it. Lynch would seal the deal by not investigating the Clintons further. Ryan gets to remain Speaker, the Democrats get the Senate and the White House and 2024 is up for grabs.”\n\nObviously there are many more details, many dark secrets and much more story to tell. The entire interview with Noonan will premier on Fox News on July 28th.\n\nNoonan will undoubtedly spend a good chunk of his money making sure the Clintons can never find him so he doesn’t end up just another name on their list of shattered lives and families.

"Sean Spicer Handed Mid-Briefing Note Saying, “You Just Committed A Felony”\nWASHINGTON – White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was in the middle of his daily press briefing Thursday when an aide handed him a note that said, “You just committed a felony,” according to a senior White House official with knowledge of the note’s contents.\n\nSpicer paused briefly after reading the note, then cleared his throat and continued with the briefing, taking a question from Jonathan Karl of ABC News.\n\nThe alleged felony the note referred to apparently centers around Spicer’s remarks during the briefing about an alleged Justice Department investigation into ties between President Trump, his campaign team and officials representing the Russian government. Spicer said the investigators have, “no evidence, zero.”\n\n“I’m telling you they have nothing,” Spicer said in response to a question from Hallie Jackson of NBC News. The briefing was recorded and broadcast on several different networks and news sites. “I’ve seen what they have, I got hold of it, and they have nothing. They should quit while they’re ahead.”\n\nIt is illegal for a White House official to try to influence an investigation by the FBI or the Justice Department itself. It is unclear whether the investigation Spicer was referring to is happening on behalf of the FBI or the Justice Department itself, which has jurisdiction over the FBI.\n\nNo matter the specific agency in charge of the investigation, any investigation of the type that Spicer was apparently referring to is supposed to be conducted free of any White House influence. If Spicer did, in fact, ask for, and ultimately procure any information on an investigation into President Trump, he may well have broken the law simply by doing so. On top of that issue, there is the fact that he publicized the investigation, which is also against the law, as any such investigation is considered classified.\n\nIt is unclear which Spicer aide handed him the note, but according to the White House official we spoke to, the entire White House communications team was in shock when they heard Spicer admit communicating with the Justice Department official from the podium in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House.\n\n“They were all blown away,” the official said. “I mean, they know he’s not the brightest bulb, but they didn’t think he was quite that dumb.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: This article is a work of satire and is completely fictional.","http://itsthebulletin.com/spicer-felony/","1489099407.0"

"Seattle Police Begin Gun Confiscations: No Laws Broken, No Warrant, No Charges\nSome residents also complained that a man open carrying a handgun made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe…”\n\n(Zero Hedge) A man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws. The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil.\n\nThis sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government.\n\nThe new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they’ve just begun the confiscation. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges. The man was not identified by authorities.\n\n** MORE GUN CONFISCATION COVERAGE at Liberty Headlines **\n\nNeighbors complained that the man had been “staring” at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm.

"BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT\nBREAKING!\n\nLiberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA “confirming” Russian interference in the presidential election.\n\nThey’re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!\n\nScary!\n\nFrom HuffPo:\n\nA 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.\n\nIn light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump’s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.\n\nAt 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://usasnich.com/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president/","1481483004.0"
"Information for the Nation\nHaven’t you noticed how cranky or irritable you are when you haven’t had a decent night’s sleep after a long time? Yes, sleep can brighten your mood and more. However, it doesn’t only do wonders for your emotional health—it also does great things for your overall well-being.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet are part of the process of getting to your ideal health, but it all starts with sleep. Here’s why you should change your opinion of sleeping as just resting a tired body.\n\nSleeping helps with Memory\n\nThose who lost a lot of time not sleeping in their childhood may suffer loss of memory in their old age. That’s because when we sleep, our minds become like computers; while we aren’t aware of it, it processes things we’ve done during the day when we awake. It’s how we master some things.\n\nSleep gives you ‘Immortality’\n\nWell, we do fall asleep when we die, but sleeping—or getting the required amount of sleep—helps us live longer. A study done on people between the ages of 50 and 80 revealed that six hours or more of sleep helps people live longer. Obviously, we also are more active and alert when we’ve gotten our required hours of sleep.\n\nSleep helps your Body heal\n\nWhen we get our required several hours sleeping, our body slows down and gets more rest. This also helps in curbing certain diseases. Problems with the heart, results like stroke, arthritis, and diabetes are only some of the possible problems the body faces when it lacks sleep over a long time.\n\nIdeally Creating Ideas\n\nWhen we get a good night’s rest, we become more alert. Our minds are more creative as well. Studies have pointed to sleep as an aid to repurposing your memories. Hence, when we get more sleep, we get more ideas as well, leading to more creativity in our activities.\n\n﻿\n\nWhen we get more sleep, we also get less cranky. This is better for all the people around us and for us, as we win more friends by sleeping—it’s like hitting two birds with one stone.","http://theseattletribune.com/trumps-unsecured-android-device-believed-to-be-source-of-recent-white-house-leaks/","None"
"UPDATE: Charles Schumer Received $500k Donation From Pro-Illegal Alien Group Just Before Vote\nDemocrat Senator Charles Schumer was willing to shut down the government and hurt millions of people while causing billions in economic damage over his desire to remove penalties for illegal aliens and open the borders, but have you wondered why?\n\nAn explosive report by The Gateway Pundit reveals that there may be a reason for his support beyond Schumer’s purported love of Mexican criminals above our veterans and poor children.

Only five Democrats summoned enough patriotism to vote FOR America.\n\n2018 is our chance to reaffirm that we want Donald Trump’s America — that we want freedom and democracy and rule of law. It’s time for us to not be willing to settle for a majority. We must completely take Congress from the hands of the Democrat Party.\n\nAMERICA FIRST!","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.online/2018/01/20/update-charles-schumer-received-500k-donation-from-pro-illegal-alien-group-just-before-vote/","1516424400.0"
"Here's How Miami's Blind Handled Hurricane Irma\nFor hours, Hurricane Irma's winds battered Jorge Hernandez's house in Flagami. Days earlier, he had mounted accordion shutters as a precaution, but now the metal clanged violently against his windows. Petrified, his fiancée and her 18-year-old daughter scrambled through the pitch-black darkness, but even as they got upstairs, they realized there was no escape. The sound reverberated on every floor.\n\n'I was OK, though,' Hernandez says. 'I can manage around our house without lights, no problem.' When Hernandez was 9, doctors diagnosed him with retinitis pigmentosa, a rare condition in which the back of the eye is permanently damaged. Since then, the 51-year-old technology instructor from Cuba has learned to live without eyesight.\n\nDays before the storm hit, Miami-Dade County offered beds in special-needs shelters, emergency transportation services, and nonperishable food to its citizens with disabilities. Even so, the majority of the county’s estimated 67,000 blind or visually impaired residents opted to ride out the storm at home, either alone or with loved ones. Blindness can be an especially difficult disability during a catastrophic storm, so many prepared days in advance, stocking up on supplies and reaching out to their communities for help. Though streets flooded and power was lost, Miami’s blind say they fared reasonably well during the storm, avoiding injury and weathering Irma’s wrath.\n\nWhen Irma was churning in the Atlantic, 55-year-old Denise Valkema from Kendall heard about the storm while listening to a weather update on her iPhone. “I didn’t need to see the cone to understand that we were in the cone,” says Valkema, who decided to stay at home. 'With the proper tools, we can do anything, but with blindness, things just need to be done in a different way.'\n\nAs president of the National Federation of the Blind of Florida, Valkema instructed her members to stay connected with a support network, such as a church or neighborhood organization, and to ask for help when needed. Valkema, who is blind, asked a neighbor to help her cover a leaky roof with a tarp before the storm. 'A lot of times, it's about asking for assistance,' she says. 'You can't be a shut-in.'\n\nWith preparation, Valkema says, blind people can be independent during a natural disaster. Days before the storm, the county advised civilians to stock up with at least 72 hours' worth of food and water. It was a manageable task even for a person without sight, says Valkema, who quickly called an Uber and stocked up at her local Publix. 'It doesn't matter if you're blind, elderly or if you just don't have friends in the area; we need to make more of an effort instead of doing things last-minute,' she says.\n\nThose who waited out the hurricane agree.\n\nTwelve miles away in Flagami, Hernandez first heard about the storm five days before it made landfall. Frantic, he notified his parents, who live nearby, and called his brother, who owned a house in Marathon, a city deep in the Florida Keys. 'I was scared,' Hernandez says. 'I wanted them to be safe.'\n\nThough Hernandez survived Hurricane Andrew in 1992, he knew that Irma, one of the strongest storms in history, was in a different league. The next day, he dragged his fiancée and her daughter to the grocery store to buy a week's worth of canned tuna and Vienna sausages. 'It was hard trying to get water,' he says, 'Literally, none was to be found in Miami.' Coming home, he boarded up the windows and shoved a hurricane kit in the bedroom closet. 'I was in charge of making sure we could get to the flashlights quickly,' he says.\n\nIn spite of their preparation, the house lost power when Irma hit Sunday morning. Of the three, Hernandez was best prepared to navigate a blackout, but even he couldn't brush away the fear when floodwater began seeping beneath the front door. 'Every hour, we had to run into the living room to mop it up,' he says.\n\nThe next morning, the storm passed. Rattled, Hernandez and his fiancée rushed outside to assess the damage. Scanning the backyard, she confirmed only part of their fence was destroyed. 'We were lucky,' he says. His family members weren't as fortunate. A hundred miles south, Hernandez's brother's house in Marathon was five feet deep in floodwater, lost beyond repair. 'I got teary-eyed,' Hernandez whispers. 'The whole family visited that house many times.'\n\nPerhaps most tested by the storm was Joanne Carswell, a 64-year-old former physical therapist aide from Coconut Grove, who says she's still reeling from the damage Irma wrought.\n\nIn 2009, failed knee-replacement surgery caused Carswell to lose function in her left knee. Meanwhile, her right knee struggled with arthritis. With barely one functional leg and major vision loss, Carswell called Special Transportation Services and fled to her friend's house the Friday before the storm. Unfortunately, her friend, Bernadette, though not visually impaired, was also wheelchair-bound and, to make matters worse, asthmatic.\n\nThroughout the weekend, the two swayed to the soothing sounds of gospel music and comedy shows. Then the storm came. As houses throughout the city lost power, Bernadette's air conditioner began to sputter. As the heat and humidity grew, Bernadette began to hack violently. 'Even though she had an oxygen machine, she couldn't catch her breath and had to sit up,' Carswell says. 'She kept saying, 'Help, Joanne, help.''\n\nFive years earlier, Carswell's nephew had died of an asthma attack. She knew she wouldn't be able to help Bernadette in case of an emergency. 'I was so scared,' she says.\n\nTwo days after the storm passed, Carswell returned safely home. Besides the spoiled food in her fridge and the felled trees in her backyard, she found little damage to her house. She later discovered that Bernadette was admitted to the hospital due to respiratory problems that day. Even so, Carswell says she doesn’t blame anyone for the challenges she experienced staying at home.\n\n“FPL, Comcast, the county, and the city, everybody worked so hard,” says Virginia Jacko, president of Miami Lighthouse, a sanctuary for the visually impaired. “They could only do what was humanly possible.” Even though the county’s blind and visually impaired were offered help getting to shelters, she says many refused. “Blind people do things by habit — by touch — so a new routine, like going to a shelter or being forced to take a new route, can be worrisome,' she says.\n\nJacko notes that past studies have suggested that people with disabilities such as visual impairment might have worse experiences with trauma and stress after natural disasters. Because 80 percent of her clients live alone, Jacko says isolation was a major concern. Even so, she says most of her clients have checked in to say they survived the storm without too much inconvenience. 'When you're blind, you're used to seeing in the dark, and here we teach our clients how to use other senses in different environments,' she says.\n\nIf anything, Hernandez says the aftermath of Irma has been more difficult to navigate. Just a few days ago, he was walking to a Walgreens near his workplace when he noticed with his cane that the sidewalk was littered with fallen trees and debris. 'It was so hard to walk around the trees,' he says, chuckling. 'It was like a little obstacle course.'\n\n","http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miamis-blind-navigated-hurricane-irma-with-preparation-county-help-9686035/","1506340800.0"
"Mueller, Rosenstein, and Comey: The Three Amigos from the Deep State\nBy Roger Stone\n\nThere is a longtime and incestuous relationship between the fixers who have been tasked with taking down President Trump, under the fake narrative of enforcing the law. James Comey worked in the DOJ directly under Mueller until 2005. Rod Rosenstein and Mueller go even further back.\n\nJames Comey wasn’t just some associate of Mueller back then, but rather his protégé. Under the George W. Bush presidency, when Comey was serving as Deputy Attorney General under John Ashcroft, Robert Mueller was Comey’s go-to guy when he needed help. The two men, as it came to light years later, conspired to disobey potential White House orders to leave Ashcroft alone when he was incapacitated in March of 2004. These two men, when together, will not obey orders if they think they know better. Being filled with hubris and almost two decades of doing just about anything they want, they always think they know better.\n\nRod Rosenstein, current Deputy Attorney General under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is also a member of the Mueller Gang, having worked directly under Robert Mueller at the Department of Justice as far back as 1990. When Comey was still working as the Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division for the U.S. Attorney’s office in New York, Mueller and Rosenstein were becoming thick as thieves.\n\nWe look back at Rod’s loyal work for Hillary Clinton, when he became a clean-up man for the Clinton Administration as an Associate Independent Counsel from 1995 until 1997. He supervised the investigation that found no basis for criminal prosecution of White House officials who had obtained classified FBI background reports. He did a great job covering for the Team Bill Clinton, including covering for Hillary, as she was one of the people who had access to the reports, and may have even requested them. Convenient for the Clintons, no indictments were filed.\n\nHaving proven his loyalty to the powers that be, Rosenstein was appointed to work in the US Office of the Independent Counsel under Ken Starr on the Whitewater Investigation into then President Bill Clinton. By some miracle, or clever work by insiders, the Clintons escaped culpability once again. Rod wasn’t alone, he had help from his co-worker James Comey, who was also making sure the Clintons were exonerated during the Whitewater affair.\n\nHere is Robert Mueller, sitting in the middle of his two wunderkinds, making sure the path before them is smooth and obstacle free, and practically shepherding their careers along the way. Is it any wonder that once Jeff Sessions shamelessly recused himself from the Russia Collusion Conspiracy investigation and turned it over to his deputy Rod Rosenstein, that Rosenstein would reach out to his old mentor for help? Who is surprised when three of the top lawman fixers for the Clinton/Bush cabal have axes in their eyes for President Donald J. Trump?\n\nEnter Lisa Barsoomian, wife of Rod Rosenstein. Lisa is a high-powered attorney in Washington, DC, who specializes in opposing Freedom of Information Act requests on behalf of the Deep State, err, I mean, the Intelligence Communities.\n\nLisa Barsoomian works for R. Craig Lawrence, an attorney who has represented Robert Mueller three times, James Comey five times, Barack Obama forty-five times, Kathleen Sebellius fifty-six times, Bill Clinton forty times, and Hillary Clinton seventeen times between 1991 and 2017.\n\nBarsoomian participated in some of this work personally and has herself represented the FBI at least five separate times. It would be great to research the specifics of the cases she worked in, many of the documents from the Court Docket relating to these cases have been removed from the D.C. District and Appeals Court, including her representation for Clinton in 1998’s case Hamburg. V. Clinton.\n\nHer loyalties are clearly with the entities that make up the Deep State, as are her husbands.\n\nThey are a DC Globalist Power Couple, and they mean to destroy Donald Trump under the bidding of their Globalist Masters. Rod Rosenstein should not have any position in President Trump’s administration, let alone one with so much power to harm the Office of the Presidency.\n\nMueller is also a Deep State lackey, even acting as delivery boy for Hillary’s State Department, hand transporting ten grams of highly enriched uranium under the auspices of counter-terror. It must only be coincidence that this happened at the same time as Hillary and her henchman John Podesta were nurturing the Uranium One deal that would see Russia take control over 20% of America’s proven uranium reserves. Shortly after the Russia uranium deal closed, the Clinton Foundation was showered with many millions of dollars from Russian donors.\n\nComey, Rosenstein, and their patron Mueller are truly the Three Amigos of the Deep State. Joined long ago in mutual regard, owing allegiance only to each other and the enshrined bureaucracy that created them. As their actions show, they desire to thwart the will of the people and depose the duly elected President of the United States of America by using all the powers at their disposal.","https://stonecoldtruth.com/muller-rosenstein-and-comey-the-three-amigos-from-the-deep-state/","1498174763.0"
"A Search Warrant Was Just Served At The Obama Residence\nJoin America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 6.6k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nJust after dawn in the quiet Tracy Street neighborhood of Washington, DC, the FBI and NSA served a warrant at the Obama’s post-presidential rental mansion. The house, fortified with 10-foot walls and guard stations for Secret Service officers, serves as Obama’s residence in Washington and allegedly as the headquarters for the deep State Shadow government.\n\nThe warrant, which would have had to have been issued by a federal judge for federal agents to be involved, is for the search and seizure of any and all documents, hard drives or correspondence relating to national security not officially presented to the former president during his security briefings.\n\nEssentially, the FBI and NSA are alleging that there are shady dealings going on inside the house that has been the center of controversy since Paul Ryan, John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Dr. Ben Carson were all seen entering the house for secret meetings, presumably to take down President Trump.\n\nIf secrets are being revealed to keep Obama in power as a player in Washington and the warrant roots them out, a lot of people are going to be in a lot of trouble.\n\nThis is a developing story that will be updated.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://thelastlineofdefense.org/a-search-warrant-was-just-served-at-the-obama-residence/","1492948323.0"
"Actor Keanu Reeves: “For Me Trump Is The Symbol Of A Successful Man And A Role Model For Every Young American, Something That Our Nation Was Looking For Years.I Don’t Think That America Will Again Hav\nWhen Keanu Reeves was filming Speed, in 1993, he spent every spare minute learning lines in his trailer. These lines weren’t from the film he was working on – as Jack Traven, the SWAT officer who takes control of a bomb-laden bus, Reeves didn’t have a great deal to say – but from William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, a well-thumbed copy of which he would carry around on set. “I finished playing Jack, went into the trailer, and, you know – ‘How all occasions do inform against me,/ And spur my dull revenge’,” he says, reeling off the opening few lines of Hamlet’s last soliloquy. Did it help him cope with what was, at that point, his most commercially prominent role to date? “Hum.” He pauses. “I don’t know. There was definitely a yin and yang thing going on.” As he continues, what soon becomes clear is that those snatched moments of Shakespeare helped Reeves make sense not so much of Traven or Hamlet, but of himself. He was 29 years old at the time, with a career that was skyrocketing. But Reeves didn’t see himself as an action hero – or not just an action hero, at least.

"PENCE SOFTENS STANCE ON PORTER ABUSE ALLEGATIONS\nWhat do you think about Vice President Mike Pence’s recent comments on abuse allegations leveled against White House aide Rob Porter?\n\nPreviously, Pence said he was “appalled” when he first learned about the domestic abuse allegations against now-former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, and is “going to look into the matter” of what the White House and chief of staff John Kelly knew.\n\nPence, who just returned from South Korea for the Olympics,he is concerned about what White House chief of staff John Kelly may have known about the allegations and didn’t take action against Porter. Porter is accused of kicking and punching his first wife, Colbie Holderness, and his second wife, Jennie Willoughby, filed an emergency protective order against him.\n\nPence has softened his comments about Porter saying his actions if true were “in accordance with Biblical principles” and that women should “submit to their husbands as their husbands are their heads just as Jesus is head of the church.”\n\nPence had previously said that he found out about the Porter situation when he awoke Wednesday on the way to South Korea. Asked why he sometimes seems so unaware of happenings in the White House, Pence simply said it is an honor to serve in the Trump administration and has been using his time in public office to get closer to the Lord.\n\nHe did not directly answer a question as to whether he believes the president’s staff is serving him well, and said that he really has no time for such trivialities as staffing.\n\n“Jesus didn’t worry about what his Apostles were doing all the time”, Pence told Fox News, “I’ll let the President worry about what his staff are doing.”","https://www.tdtalliance.com/pence-softens-stance-porter-abuse-allegations/","1518353570.0"

"HOLLYWOOD CELEBS: WE WILL GO ON ‘TOTAL STRIKE’ IF TRUMP DOES NOT RESIGN\nMany of Hollywood’s elite are threatening to go on strike in protest of our President.\n\nThis rumor began circulating as soon as Trump was elected President of the United States, but these idiots continue to push the matter. Our message to them, DO IT. We don’t need jerks like you in Hollywood anyway. The fact that people like Rosie O’Donnell think that the movie and television industry wouldn’t survive without them proves just how ignorant they really are.\n\nMike Opelka called out the rich actors and directors who were threatening the strike, warning them of the damage this strike would cause to everyone else in the industry.

"$4 Million And 2 Dead Bodies Found In Democrat Mayor’s Storage Unit\nMoyor Stephen “Stormin'” Foreman of Goose Rapids, Missouri has been placed on the FBI’s most wanted list after a storage locker he apparently forgot to pay for was auctioned off — complete with $4 million in cash and 2 dead bodies.\n\nSpecial Agent Hendrick Slurryman explained that it was a clerical error that caused the Mayor, a Democrat, to tuck tail and run:\n\n“Steve Foreman would have never even been a suspect in the crimes we found evidence of in that locker. The bodies and money trace back to an armored car robbery in Southeast New Mexico. He had the unit on an autopay contract but his credit card expired and due to a juxtoposed number…he never got the notice in the mail.”\n\nAccording to his secretary, John Lewis Prager, he first he heard of it was when it came over the police scanner in the Mayor’s office. “He suddenly had to go,” said Prager, visibly upset, “It’s the last time I’ve seen or heard from him. I’m guessing he knew what was about to happen and went to some other evil storage locker to cash out and escape.”\n\nThe FBI thinks Prager is right. Foreman reportedly has more than a dozen storage units spread across Missouri and possibly hundreds around the country. He was spotted on surveillance cameras in Hamilton leaving a unit with a bag from an armored car:\n\nA bag that size could contain millions in $100 bills or bearer bonds. The FBI also suspects that Foreman has fake passports and various pre-planned escape routes. “Finding him won’t be easy,” said Slurryman, “but we won’t stop until we do.”\n\nThe mayor’s job in Goose Rapids will revert to Foreman’s Deputy Mayor.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://ladiesofliberty.net/its-always-a-democrat/","1514837312.0"
"John Hagee Calls For “Prosecuting Women Who Say God’s Name During Intercourse”\n“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”\n\n“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.\n\n“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”\n\n“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”\n\nThe pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”\n\nAsked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2017/02/07/john-hagee-god-made-lesbians-flat-identified-normal-people-easily-2/","1486443600.0"
"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand\nDelta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand\n\n[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump’s attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATOR\n\nDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.\n\nA Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.\n\nAccording to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.\n\nIn a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, “Solyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.”\n\nOur Secret Service source supports that contention.\n\n“Obama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases. He doesn’t keep them in his name, as that would be too conspicuous. The administration has learned about many of them and has been working with foreign governments to seize Obama’s illicitly gained assets. Many of these nations are not exactly friendly to the United States; we don’t know what Trump offered in exchange for rights to seize assets in non-extradition countries or put special operations boots on the ground on foreign soil. I’m sure the price way high. Clandestine missions are occurring right now. The Solyndra mansion was just one of many,” our source explained.\n\nAt 3:00 am (local time), a pair of helicopters, including decoy craft, airlifted Delta to its destination. They found the mansion deserted; however, according to our source, the dwelling had been recently occupied. The unit commander discovered freshly chopped vegetables and lukewarm coffee in the kitchen; outside fresh tire impressions lead away from the compound. Someone, our source said, must have tipped off the occupants shortly before Delta arrived on scene.\n\nStill, Delta did not leave the location empty-handed. They seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese manufactured firearms and explosives. Moreover, and perhaps most disturbing, a maze of underground tunnels, ostensibly used for human trafficking, ran for miles in every direction beneath the surface.

"Democrats Want To Add Martin Luther King To Mount Rushmore\nThe halls of Congress were filled with intrigue Monday morning when ten Democratic Congressmen led by Muslim Keith Ellison demanded that Mount Rushmore — which features faces of U.S. presidents — be changed to accommodate a new face: a Communist and tax cheat they view as a civil rights hero because he gave a few speeches that sounded nice.\n\n“Martin Luther King has done more for this country than most Presidents, especially the current one, and he should be honored for that,” Ellison said. “The best way to honor him is to make sure the entire nation sees his face on what is easily our most recognizable monument.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi profanely added that “with our shithole racist so-called President in office, we need to send a message to the world that he does not represent our values.”\n\nShe was referencing, of course, alleged remarks President Trump made about third-world countries like Africa. President Trump and others present have denied that the President said anything of the sort and no evidence has been produced that he called any country a “shithole.”\n\nDemocrats love to honor terrible people and beneath it all that’s what MLK was. Why don’t they want to honor John Mitchell, who helped free Irish slaves in America at the cost of his own life? Why don’t they want to honor Tess McGavers, who helped more than 1,400 slaves make their way to freedom from her basement in Alabama?\n\nThe reason is that they are white.

"Stuck 71 hours in an elevator, man kills and eats his wife to survive\nPhiladephia, PA | 44-year old Bruce Franklin was arrested this morning, after he confessed to killing his wife and eating her flesh while he was stuck with her in an elevator.\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia Police Department, the partially devoured corpse of his wife was lying next to him when he was rescued after being stuck for three days in an elevator.\n\nMr Franklin immediately confessed that he had reluctantly killed her and eaten almost 12 lbs of her flesh, saying it was necessary to his own survival.\n\nPhiladelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross, says the accused clearly felt guilty about his crime\n\nMr Franklin and his wife, Janet Willis, were coming back from the restaurant when they took an express elevator to reach their apartment on the 42nd floor.\n\nOn their way up, the elevator unexpectedly stopped, and the couple was stranded.\n\nMr Franklin says he hit the alarm and waited, but nothing happened. He investigated his surroundings, but there was no warning text and no elevator emergency phone in the 6-by-6 box.\n\nSince they didn’t have their cell phones with them, the couple had no way of reaching the outside world.\n\nHours went by and no one came. Starting to get desperate, the 300-lb man tried to pry the door open, planning to climb down the elevator shaft like Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Instead, he was met with a solid concrete wall with the number 13 stenciled on it.\n\nBeing in an express elevator, there was no opening for the floors that weren’t served, and Mr. Franklin found himself facing 34 floors of solid concrete shaft.\n\nThe couple could do nothing but stand there for the rest of the afternoon. And into the night. And then overnight. Then all day the next day.\n\nAfter about 48 hours, Mr Franklin says he was suffering from severe dehydration and began fearing for his life.\n\nAccording to his lawyer, Darrel Hunter, Bruce Franklin had no other choice than to kill his wife and ingest her flesh and blood if he wanted to survive.\n\nMr Hunter says his client is in fact a victim and that Ms Willis’ death was caused by the negligence of the residential building’s security staff.\n\nDespite his lawyer’s claims, Mr Franklin now faces a total of 14 charges, including second degree murder and cannibalism. He could face up to 75 years in prison.","https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/stuck-71-hours-in-an-elevator-man-kills-and-eats-his-wife-to-survive/","1492525977.0"

"Trump's Signed His Latest Executive Order And It Will Effectively Eliminate Mass Amounts Of Democrat Voters\nOn April 10th of this year, the President officially signed an executive order that will aid in reducing poverty in the United States by promoting financial opportunity and economic mobility. However, it has largely been under-reported on. The White House press office did, however, release a statement on it saying,\n\n“By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote economic mobility, strong social networks, and accountability to American taxpayers, it is hereby ordered as follows:\n\nSection 1. Purpose. The United States and its Constitution were founded on the principles of freedom and equal opportunity for all. To ensure that all Americans would be able to realize the benefits of those principles, especially during hard times, the Government established programs to help families with basic unmet needs. Unfortunately, many of the programs designed to help families have instead delayed economic independence, perpetuated poverty, and weakened family bonds. While bipartisan welfare reform enacted in 1996 was a step toward eliminating the economic stagnation and social harm that can result from long-term Government dependence, the welfare system still traps many recipients, especially children, in poverty and is in need of further reform and modernization in order to increase self-sufficiency, well-being, and economic mobility.\n\nSec. 2. Policy. (a) In 2017, the Federal Government spent more than $700 billion on low-income assistance. Since its inception, the welfare system has grown into a large bureaucracy that might be susceptible to measuring success by how many people are enrolled in a program rather than by how many have moved from poverty into financial independence. This is not the type of system that was envisioned when welfare programs were instituted in this country. The Federal Government’s role is to clear paths to self-sufficiency, reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need. The Federal Government should do everything within its authority to empower individuals by providing opportunities for work, including by investing in Federal programs that are effective at moving people into the workforce and out of poverty. It must examine Federal policies and programs to ensure that they are consistent with principles that are central to the American spirit — work, free enterprise, and safeguarding human and economic resources. For those policies or programs that are not succeeding in those respects, it is our duty to either improve or eliminate them.\n\nTrending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! ‘That Is Not Acceptable Here – I Won’t Allow It!’\n\n(b) It shall be the policy of the Federal Government to reform the welfare system of the United States so that it empowers people in a manner that is consistent with applicable law and the following principles, which shall be known as the Principles of Economic Mobility:\n\n(i) Improve employment outcomes and economic independence (including by strengthening existing work requirements for work-capable people and introducing new work requirements when legally permissible);\n\n(ii) Promote strong social networks as a way of sustainably escaping poverty (including through work and marriage);\n\n(iii) Address the challenges of populations that may particularly struggle to find and maintain employment (including single parents, formerly incarcerated individuals, the homeless, substance abusers, individuals with disabilities, and disconnected youth);\n\n(iv) Balance flexibility and accountability both to ensure that State, local, and tribal governments, and other institutions, may tailor their public assistance programs to the unique needs of their communities and to ensure that welfare services and administering agencies can be held accountable for achieving outcomes (including by designing and tracking measures that assess whether programs help people escape poverty);\n\n(v) Reduce the size of bureaucracy and streamline services to promote the effective use of resources;\n\n(vi) Reserve benefits for people with low incomes and limited assets;\n\n(vii) Reduce wasteful spending by consolidating or eliminating Federal programs that are duplicative or ineffective;\n\n(viii) Create a system by which the Federal Government remains updated on State, local, and tribal successes and failures, and facilitates access to that information so that other States and localities can benefit from it; and\n\n(ix) Empower the private sector, as well as local communities, to develop and apply locally based solutions to poverty.””\n\nThe executive order continues to describe in great detail and length how the administration intends on curbing poverty. But most importantly it focuses on several key factors in achieving this outcome,\n\nimprove employment outcomes and economic independence;\n\npromote marriage and family as a way of escaping poverty;\n\naddress the challenges of hard-to-employ populations;\n\nprovide more flexibility to States, while ensuring accountability for achieving outcomes;\n\nstreamline services to more effectively use taxpayer resources;\n\nreserve benefits for those truly in need;\n\nconsolidate duplicative programs;\n\nfacilitate greater sharing of information between States and localities; and\n\nempower the private sector to find solutions to poverty\n\nIn the fine print of the executive order, the administration makes it clear they will be increasing work requirements for those utilizing subsidized government benefits, focusing on using taxpayer dollars for their intended purpose, as well as empowering state and local authorities to provide services to those in need.\n\nThis executive order is going to be yet another notch under the belt of the administration in curbing poverty and decreasing unemployment. For the third straight month, the United States has maintained a 4.1 percent unemployment rate which is the lowest it has been since 2000. These are near record low numbers at a time when businesses are dealing with a shortage of labor.\n\nPresident Trump brought this order about because despite the labor shortage federal government assistance benefits are being used at an all-time high. In 2016 alone, a total of 16 million able-bodied individuals were enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP). While in January 2018 74 million were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). These numbers continue to increase and something must be done about it which is exactly why the President introduced and signed this executive order.\n\nBy focusing on creating more opportunities for Americans to work it will lead to more income in their pockets and less of a need for governmental assistance programs. That means they’ll be less likely to vote Democrat. This is what provides people a pathway to financial freedom and the middle class and that is what this administration is all about. Especially given the fact the statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that 97 percent of full-time workers eventually move out of poverty.\n\nShare if you agree with this message of the President","https://rwnofficial.com/trump-executive-order-democrat-voters/","1524441505.0"
"Denzel Washington: ‘Criminal-In-Chief’ Obama ‘Tore Heart Out Of America’\nFormer president Barack Obama ran the United States “like a banana republic” as “criminal-in-chief” and enriched himself and his cronies at the expense of the rest of the country, according to Denzel Washington.\n\n“Federal debt skyrocketed under Obama. He was printing money by the end of his reign. This is unheard of in our history. He ran the country like a banana republic,” said Denzel Washington at a New York screening of his new film, the legal drama “Roman J. Israel, Esq.“\n\nAsked by a reporter whether his information about Obama was correct, Denzel Washington confirmed that it was “absolutely correct.” He also criticized mainstream media for attempting to turn Obama into a “kind of idol.”\n\n“Why aren’t CNN discussing the facts? They think we are too stupid to understand the metrics?” Denzel Washington said, explaining that he had seen “a CNN segment about Obama’s legacy that blew my mind and left me raging.”\n\n“There were more ready-and-willing workers out of the labor force than ever before by the time that guy left office. Obama blew it for America big time and now they are trying to portray him as some kind of idol?”\n\n“The number of people in America on food stamps more than tripled in his second term. More than tripled! Average family income went down dramatically. Home ownership rates across America went down the toilet.”\n\n“Obama and his cronies sold us out. Real American workers have never had less of a share of the economy.”\n\nThe Equalizer actor also explained that while many of his Hollywood peers were “groomed by the Obamas” with “invitations to parties in the White House, black-tie balls and barbecues on the lawn”, he wasn’t extended the same treatment.\n\n“He knew I was very suspect about him. I have always been very suspect about him.”\n\n“Where did he come from? What was he really doing before running for office? His history sure isn’t what they say. Did he go to Columbia? Who put him in power?”\n\nAddressing the reporters personally, Denzel Washington called them out for refusing to publish anything critical about Obama and his colleagues.\n\n“Once upon a time this is what investigative journalists at the big newspapers would be determined to find out. Now you have all been co-opted. You defend the crooks.”","http://yournewswire.com/denzil-washington-obama-america/","1512147257.0"
"ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail\nUPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.\n\nBreitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.\n\nMr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.\n\nSargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”\n\nAccording to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.\n\nSonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.","http://www.breitbart.com/california/2017/10/17/ice-detainer-issued-for-suspected-wine-country-arsonist-in-sonoma-jail/","1508212800.0"

"Muslim Federal Judge Rules Two Items Of Sharia Law Legal\nShare This As American As Apple Pie Article Now! 61.9k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER\n\nJudge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith of the 22nd District Federal Court of Appeals ruled this morning that two “critical issues for Muslims” in Sharia Law had to be abided by in the United States court system because of the systematic infusion clause and because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states.\n\nAlallaha-Smith noted that the 14th Amendment doesn’t necessarily exclude foreign influence from being allowed by law, citing the Christmas Holiday as a perfect example:\n\n“Christmas is a Christian holiday exclusively, yet if you’re a Muslim and you want to go about your day without being bothered you can’t because the laws of a city in a city in Rome take precedent over the 1st Amendment, which guarantees no state sponsored religion. A federal Chrsitmas holiday is just that. With that as precedent, understanding that a higher court may reverse it, my decision is that items one and two on the docket are allowable between family members as prescribed by Sharia Law.”\n\nThe items Judge Alallaha-Smith refers to are:\n\nA man who finds his Godly wife in the arms of another may beat her in a non-life-threatening manner as prescribed by the Koran. The punishment of death for laying with another man in her own bed cannot be enforced on American soil, but the woman can be beaten daily for a period of ten years.\n\nA family in need of expansion shall allow the marriage of first cousins for one generation as prescribed by the Koran. Women in those families can marry as young as 9 but won’t be allowed to consummate until they hit maturity as prescribed in the Koran.\n\nUntil this is fast-tracked to the Supreme Court, which can sometimes take years, Muslim women in America will be at risk.\n\nShare This As American As Apple Pie Article Now! 61.9k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER","https://web.archive.org/web/http://asamericanasapplepie.org/2017/07/24/muslim-federal-judge-rules-two-items-of-sharia-law-legal/","1500868800.0"

"Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Cancelling Saturday Night Live\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Today President Donald Trump made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency by signing Executive Order 14838, which cancels the television show Saturday Night Live, or SNL. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any private or federally funded agency to air or show footage of the popular television show in any format. Any company or individual who violates this order can now face fines of up to $250,000 and five years in federal prison.\n\nDuring the press conference, Trump explained that his decision was based on a personal belief that the show is “divisive” and “contrary to America’s deepest held values.”\n\n“Saturday Night Live is the definition of fake news and that is why it is now gone forever,” Trump told reporters. “It mocks the very beliefs that keep this great country running smoothly. I’ve never found the show to be humorous and I don’t know how it stayed on the air as long as it did, but I made sure to put an end to that today. I know some actions that I take are questioned by those who don’t want or understand freedom; these are people who hate America, but I know my true supporters are with me on this decision to cancel SNL, just like all my other brilliant ideas.”\n\nTrump’s signing of Executive Order 14838 comes after more than two seasons of Saturday Night Live attacking the current President.\n\n“In all my years of watching SNL, they’ve always mocked the current President in some way or another, but with Trump it’s a totally different ball game; they are actually trying to get him impeached and take down his administration piece by piece,” Paul Horner, a senior political analyst for Fox News said. “I can see why he would want the show cancelled; but just a reminder to all those people out there trying to get Trump impeached, if you do, then you have Vice President Mike Pence to deal with, and he’s just the same as Trump, but business as usual in Washington – think about it.”\n\nLorne Michaels, who created Saturday Night Live, which premiered on NBC in 1975, told reporters he was concerned if the show had gone too far in mocking Trump.\n\n“Ever since Donald Trump became a blip on the political scene, SNL has done its best to make the public aware of the evils that this man is and what he stands for. I think it’s important that the general public sees how ridiculous it is that this man is actually President of the United States. Of course we are worried with the signing of this Executive Order, we’re all currently wondering if SNL will still air or not, if we still have jobs, but I will say with complete certainty that we won’t go down without a fight.”\n\nOn Trump’s twitter page today, the President wrote:\n\n“Saturday Night Live thinks they can mock me, the President of the United States?!!! NOT ON MY WATCH! THEY ARE GONE!!!”\n\nAlec Baldwin, a regular on SNL who plays the role of President Trump in various sketches, told CNN that the true reasons behind Trump’s actions are only ones that Trump knows himself.\n\n“He’s just mad that I’ve slept with all the women that he [Trump] couldn’t pay enough money to have sex with. Bottom line is, Trump hates watching SNL so much but his huge ego won’t let him turn it off; so I guess the signing of this Executive Order is his only recourse.”\n\nTom Downey, a professor of political science at the University of Arizona, says that he finds the entire situation very troubling.\n\n“Clearly, you have a man in Donald Trump who is dangerously incompetent and is a clear threat to everything this country stands for. His rhetoric on everything from immigration to the first amendment is terrifying, but I’m even more worried about what he’s doing from a freedom of speech perspective. Donald Trump may be vile, but even his demons like SNL are protected by the first amendment. I think that by canceling this show, SNL will become a symbol that we can all stand around and salute as a tribute to what freedom really is.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward , a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the cancellation.\n\n“Everything Trump stands for is backwards. His appointment of racist Steve Bannon, the way he unites hate for the Muslim people in this country, his support of white power organizations. He appointed a cabinet full of billionaires and millionaires to standup for the lower and middle class. The person he puts in charge of the EPA denies climate change. His person in charge of education doesn’t believe in public education. The American people should not accept this and Saturday Night Live makes fun of him the best way they know how. The children of this country deserve a leader who will build a successful future for them and can take a joke and not attempt to stop freedom of speech.” Bradley said. “Also, I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much .”\n\nBill Murray, who will be at The Valley Bar in Phoenix on June 18th, and is a former cast member of SNL, said he does not approve of what Trump has done by canceling the popular show.\n\n“This is typical Trump, in his gold house, private jet, destroying the environment, typing in all caps on Twitter, deporting anyone who his rich buddies see as an eye sore, with his ignorant, hate-filled moron supporters cheering him on. If people don’t see the mockery he’s making of this country and the world, then ‘wow’ is all I have say about that.”\n\nMatthew McConaughey told reporters that he will miss the show now that it is cancelled.\n\n“Saturday Night Live got me through some pretty tough times, I really liked that show, and now Donald Trump is taking that away from me. These are sad, sad days my friends. I need to go for a bike ride or something.”\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN that he believes what Trump is doing is the right thing.\n\n“This is a great first step in the war against masturbation in this great Christian nation of ours. From day one, Saturday Night Live has promoted self rape and other types of sinful behavior that Jesus would never approve of. Way to go Donald Trump, you are legendary! Praise!”\n\nAs of now, NBC does not have SNL scheduled for next Saturday.

"Trey Gowdy Breaks His Silence After 2 Of His Investigators Are Found Tortured And Killed…\nThe two officials were reportedly on their way to deliver a search warrant on the Clinton Presidential library, when they were tortured and killed.\n\nThe particulars of the crime were incomplete but the one thing that was for sure was that whoever managed to do it, was clearly a professional since they allegedly left absolutely no clue behind. Trey Gowdy had nothing to comment about this, for safety reasons. However he reportedly released a statement from his office in which he was held up by United States Marshals for protection. “The incident in Arkansas is just the latest in a vast conspiracy to cover up crimes by one of the most corrupt families in human history. No, we have no evidence. There’s never any evidence. What we do have, however, is a mole. Someone inside my own committee cost those men their lives by leaking their travel plans.

"VIDEO: Ronda Rousey Found Dead in Venice Residence (Possible Suicide) – USA Today News\nOn the morning of January 4, 2017, Ronda Rousey was found in a bathtub in her Venice residence, dead. Despite an immediate medical response, EMT’s were unable to revive her. The cause of death is still unknown, however a preliminary autopsy has been confirmed to be underway. First responders told us that they discovered what appeared to be a needle used for drugs, as well as a bag of an ambiguous powdered substance. While no drug use has been substantiated, her mother had previously spoken to the media about Rousey’s previous depression & drug abuse.\n\nCLICK AND SHARE TO VIEW VIDEO\n\nRousey’s mother had this to say, “All of those who have criticized Ronda for taking a loss so to heart, for not just ‘shrugging it off’ don’t understand that what made Ronda so successful is that she cares DEEPLY about winning to an extent that I don’t believe the average person can wrap his/her head around.”\n\nAfter her last fight, where she lost to Amanda Nunes in less than one minute, Rousey went silent — no one has heard a thing from her on social media, or from interviews. Her whereabouts and status were completely unknown to the public until this tragic happening was uncovered by two police officers discovered her body on a wellness check.\n\nWhile this is definitely an upset and a shock to the professional fighting community, her death was not wholly inexplicable. After her KO loss to Holly Holm at UFC 193 last year, Rousey admitted that she had contemplated suicide. Although she sought psychiatric care, her mother speculates that she “rarely attended” sessions with her psychiatrist, and only did it for the “public image of being better”.","https://web.archive.org/web/http://usatodaynews.site/video-ronda-rousey-found-dead-in-venice-residence/","None"

"Information for the Nation\nHaven’t you noticed how cranky or irritable you are when you haven’t had a decent night’s sleep after a long time? Yes, sleep can brighten your mood and more. However, it doesn’t only do wonders for your emotional health—it also does great things for your overall well-being.\n\nExercise and a healthy diet are part of the process of getting to your ideal health, but it all starts with sleep. Here’s why you should change your opinion of sleeping as just resting a tired body.\n\nSleeping helps with Memory\n\nThose who lost a lot of time not sleeping in their childhood may suffer loss of memory in their old age. That’s because when we sleep, our minds become like computers; while we aren’t aware of it, it processes things we’ve done during the day when we awake. It’s how we master some things.\n\nSleep gives you ‘Immortality’\n\nWell, we do fall asleep when we die, but sleeping—or getting the required amount of sleep—helps us live longer. A study done on people between the ages of 50 and 80 revealed that six hours or more of sleep helps people live longer. Obviously, we also are more active and alert when we’ve gotten our required hours of sleep.\n\nSleep helps your Body heal\n\nWhen we get our required several hours sleeping, our body slows down and gets more rest. This also helps in curbing certain diseases. Problems with the heart, results like stroke, arthritis, and diabetes are only some of the possible problems the body faces when it lacks sleep over a long time.\n\nIdeally Creating Ideas\n\nWhen we get a good night’s rest, we become more alert. Our minds are more creative as well. Studies have pointed to sleep as an aid to repurposing your memories. Hence, when we get more sleep, we get more ideas as well, leading to more creativity in our activities.\n\n﻿\n\nWhen we get more sleep, we also get less cranky. This is better for all the people around us and for us, as we win more friends by sleeping—it’s like hitting two birds with one stone.","http://theseattletribune.com/ex-army-sniper-takes-out-neighbors-home-intruder-from-bedroom-window/","None"
"Stephen Bannon: “Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”\nThe recently installed CEO of Donald Trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.\n\n“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.\n\nAsked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”\n\nBut, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.\n\n“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”\n\n“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.\n\nsource:politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments","https://web.archive.org/web/http://uspoln.com/2016/11/14/stephen-bannon-nobody-can-blame-beating-wife-love/","1479099600.0"
"Here is the Only Way Out of This Dire Political Situation America Is In\nHere is the Only Way Out of This Dire Political Situation America Is In\n\nBy Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson | Politics | February 1, 2017 |\n\nHi. My name is Dwayne Johnson. Many of you may know me better as The Rock.\n\nI am running for the President of the United States.\n\nI know that this may sound like a joke to many of you. But it’s not. I am throwing my hat in the ring for 2020. I am not running against Donald Trump. I am not running against whatever candidate the Democrats field. I am not running against anyone. I am running for the country. As an independent. I am running on a simple platform of compassion and civility.\n\nYou may ask why someone who has never publicly expressed a political opinion is running for office, and I will tell you that is exactly why I am running for the Presidency. I do not owe any obligation to either party, so I do not need to feel beholden to either of their platforms or their ideologies. Mine, again, is a simple platform based on civility and compassion. It is based on a desire to lift everyone up — rich, poor, young, old, black, white, American born or foreign born, gay, straight or transgender — to bring us together again, to make this country whole.\n\nThe fact that I have expressed so few political opinions I hope will help me in this effort because it is my hope not to advocate for the extreme positions of either party, but to find a middle ground between them both. It used to be possible to find some common ground, for each side to listen to each other, negotiate, and find a place in the middle that leaves everyone happy enough. I am running for the 70 percent of this country who wants to get along, who is willing to give a little to get a little. Who is nostalgic for dinnertime conversations that revolve around workdays or school, dance recitals, little league games, movies, TV shows, worship services, and celebrity gossip, instead of eating dinner fraught with anxiety about what’s going on in the news.\n\nI am someone who has worked successfully with people from both sides of the political spectrum and who, I believe, has gained the respect of people from all political stripes. I’ve been a popular college football player. I’ve been a popular professional wrestler, and I have been a popular actor, but I have also been careful never to let my ego get in the way. I have had a lot of box office hits, and I have had a lot of box office bombs, but I have never been defined by ratings, by the number of people who go see my movies, or by the crowds that came out to see me during my football and wrestling careers. I am the same, big-hearted, caring person every day, whether Hercules makes $10 million at the box office, or whether Fast & Furious 10 makes $100 million.\n\nThere is one position where I will not bend, however, and that’s where it concerns compassion for everyone, from immigrants to low-income white people to the people of color in our cities, in our suburbs, and in rural America, to the people from abroad escaping poverty, famine, or brutal dictators. We live in a huge country, and there is plenty of space for everyone, and plenty of money and resources to go around, even if that means taking a little more from the extremely well off to help out the extremely unfortunate.\n\nAs Commander in Chief, I will refashion foreign policy to align with my own personality: I will use my strength and might of our military to serve the big heart of the American public. It’s important that we stand up for the little guy, but that in doing so, never become bullies ourselves. Bullying and bluster is the surest sign of insecurity and weakness, and it is not who we are. It sure as hell isn’t who I am. We have to be better than that.\n\nSome of you may be wondering why I’ve announced my intention to run for the President of the United States only 12 days into the existing administration. There’s two reasons, actually. First of all, President Trump signed papers to begin his run for 2020 on Inauguration Day, so I am already 12 days behind!\n\nMore importantly, however, is my hope to use my popularity, my broad demographic appeal, and my name recognition to shift focus away from the ugly partisanship going on in D.C. right now and onto the themes on which I plan to run. I intend to hit the campaign trail immediately, and it is my hope that whatever cultural capital I have accrued over the years fighting Hulk Hogan or Vin Diesel is enough to attract both crowds and the media. It is also my hope that those crowds and the media might begin to absorb some of the lessons about compassion and civility that I plan to impart and apply them long before our next election rolls around.\n\nI won’t run a negative campaign, because I don’t need to. I’m Dwayne Johnson. I will never begin a sentence with, “But my opponent …” I don’t need to tear anyone down in order to make myself look bigger.\n\nGod has also blessed me with a smile that has a calming effect on those around me, and I hope to put it good use over the next four years as I tour this country in an effort to bring us all back together. I want to rebuild us around a very simple idea that that a difference of opinion does not have to separate us, that within most of us, there is goodness, that we can put that goodness to use, and that we are a better country when we are united than when we let our leaders divide us.\n\nI’m not asking for your vote now. I’m just asking you to listen. Give me four years to let me convince you that I deserve your vote before you make a decision. I’ll probably regret a few of the things I saw along the way, and in a campaign this long, there will probably be a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash, but for the first three years, anyway, I’m not here to win your vote. I’m here to offer you hope, to remind you that there’s an alternative to this current political climate waiting in the wings. I hope that I can offer you all a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI am Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and I hope to be your next President of the United States. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.\n\nDustin is the founder and co-owner of Pajiba.

"Key Health Benefit of Turmeric: Improved Brain Health\nPrint this article\n\nIf you’re in the habit of partaking of Indian and other South Asian curry dishes, you’re already doing your mental health a world of good without knowing it. That’s because evidence is piling up that one of the many health benefits of turmeric – a traditional ingredient in almost every curry dish – is that it acts to protect your brain against the ravages of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThe yellow color of a curry (and mustard) is because of the spice turmeric, known scientifically as Curcuma longa. A “rhizome” or root known for its tough brown skin and bright orange flesh, turmeric is found all over South Asia and is believed to have been in use in India for at least 3,000 years.\n\nTurmeric also has a long history of medicinal use, especially in Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine. Known to Ayurvedic practitioners as a “cleanser of the body,” turmeric is recommended for treating a wide variety of inflammation-related health problems including toothache, gum diseases, skin diseases, wounds, parasites, digestive disorders, urinary tract infections, flatulence, jaundice, menstrual discomforts, bruises, hemorrhage, and colic.\n\nToday, modern science is uncovering a rapidly growing list of diseases that can be effectively and safely treated by turmeric – specifically, by its more than 300 bioactive components, which exert one or more biological actions in our body when we consume them.\n\nMore than a thousand research studies so far have looked at the properties of curcumin, a yellow pigment and the main “curcuminoid” bioactive compound in turmeric. According to a 2015 study, “Research to date suggests that chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and most chronic diseases are closely linked, and the antioxidant properties of curcumin can play a key role in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammation diseases.”\n\nChronic inflammation is believed to play a critical role in the development of cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. And in fact, many published studies show that curcumin acts against cancers of the breast, prostate, liver, colon, lung, and pancreas. It does so by stopping cancer cells from dividing and by triggering apoptosis – also known as programmed cell death – which is nature’s method of getting rid of infected and dying cells in our body without affecting surrounding healthy tissue.\n\nHow Does Turmeric Affect the Brain?\n\nIndia has the lowest dementia rates in the world. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease among Indian adults in the age group 70-79 years is 4-5 times less than that of similarly aged American adults. Some health experts believe this is because most Indians consume between 25-50 milligrams (mg) of turmeric as part of their daily diet over their entire lifetime. Let’s take a look at what is known so far about the mechanisms by which turmeric acts to protect our brain health.\n\nCurcumin Enhances Macrophage and Immune System Activity\n\nMacrophages are an essential part of our immune system. They are a type of white blood cell that engulfs and digests cellular debris, foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, and anything else that does not have proteins that signal “I’m a healthy body cell!” on its surface.\n\nAlzheimer’s patients are known to have defects in clearing away so-called “amyloid plaques” in affected areas of their brains, which is a task normally performed by macrophages. Amyloid plaques build up outside nerve cells in the brain (known as “neurons”) and contain beta-amyloid protein and other substances.\n\nBeta-amyloid protein is a toxic protein, formed in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients when amyloid protein is processed improperly. Promisingly, in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, low doses of curcumin reduced beta-amyloid protein levels in their brains by around 40%. A follow-up study conducted at UCLA in 2006 found that curcumin helps macrophages to clear amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s patients as well.\n\nIn this study, macrophages in blood taken from nine volunteers – including six Alzheimer’s patients and three healthy control subjects – were treated with curcumin. Macrophages treated with curcumin showed a noticeably improved ability to engulf and digest amyloid plaques. In other words, curcumin appears to enhance the immune system’s ability to clear away amyloid plaques – which makes it potentially very useful as part of a future therapy for Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nCurcumin: Anti-Inflammatory Benefits for Alzheimer’s Disease\n\nOne of the main indications in Alzheimer’s disease is chronic inflammation in the brain and a buildup of pro-inflammatory substances, which happens along with the formation and accumulation of beta-amyloid protein. Prolonged treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to reduce inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nHowever, chronic use of NSAIDs is also toxic for the kidneys, liver, and gut. Curcumin has been shown to potently lower inflammation levels via multiple proven mechanisms. Its main effect is to lower levels of the so-called “pro-inflammatory cytokines”, which normally act to promote inflammation in our bodies as part of normal immune system signaling during infections and injuries. Unlike NSAIDs, turmeric is non-toxic up to very high doses, so its safety is not an issue.\n\nTurmeric: The Powerful Antioxidant\n\nHighly reactive compounds known as free radicals are created daily in our bodies as a result of normal biological processes, but also because of environmental pollution, stress, and chemical exposure. These free radicals damage cells – including neurons – as well as biological structures within them, paving the way over the long term for chronic diseases including cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nTurmeric contains powerful curcuminoid and other potent antioxidants that neutralize free radicals and prevent damage to brain cells, not only in Alzheimer’s disease, but also in other brain diseases such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease. Both curcumin and curcuma oil have been shown to significantly reduce neurological damage caused by free radicals in laboratory animal models.\n\nFurther, curcumin has been shown to reverse some of the biochemical changes associated with aging in the brain. Along with the mechanisms already described above, curcumin also binds to heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, and iron. By doing so, it may counteract any neurotoxic effects these metals may have on the brain.\n\nAdditionally, high-fat diets and increased blood cholesterol have been linked to amyloid plaque formation in the brain. Curcumin, because of its ability to block cholesterol formation, might benefit patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in which amyloid plaques are present.\n\nHow Can You Add Turmeric to Your Daily Diet?\n\nThe first thing you should know is that curcumin – the main beneficial bioactive ingredient in turmeric – is not soluble in water, but only in fats and oils. Therefore, it’s best to combine turmeric with healthy oils such as extra virgin olive or coconut oil whenever possible. Did you know that the main bioactive ingredient in black pepper seeds – known as piperine – can increase curcumin absorption by as much as 2,000%?\n\nIf you can handle it, the best way to get all of turmeric’s many health benefits is to consume whole fresh turmeric root mixed with a natural oil. Doing this enhances curcumin’s absorption into our bodies by as much as seven to eight-fold. Grated or chopped turmeric lends both color and a gingery flavor to soups and sauces.\n\nA quarter to a half teaspoon of turmeric powder can also be added to vegetables – along with a little olive oil, black pepper, and other spices to suit your taste – before roasting or baking them. One of the easiest ways to incorporate turmeric into your diet is by making turmeric tea. Start by finely slicing or grating fresh turmeric root. Add to a teapot along with cinnamon, cloves, and sliced or grated ginger root and steep in hot water. Sweeten with local honey or green leaf stevia before drinking. Remember, always use only organic, non-irradiated spices to receive the most effective anti-cancer benefits possible.","https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/brain-health-benefit-of-turmeric/","1473048142.0"

He told Fox News:\n\nWe will sit down with news outlets individually, find out what they already know and fill them in with the information we feel they deserve according to how they’ve treated this administration. Some will get the whole story, like the tried and true Fox News and Breitbart and some will get next to nothing, like the horrible Politico and NPR.\n\nWhen asked where CNN, which he refused questions from at the press conference because he considers them “fake news,” Trump said:\n\nThey’re gone. No more. Their press credentials won’t be re-issued. CNN, NBC, ABC, MSNBC, Univision and The New York Times will have to read about what happens in the White House.\n\nAsked whether or not he was concerned that denying media outlets access to publicly elected officials was a violation of the 1st Amendment, Trump said that he’s not worried about it:\n\nWith my new addition to the Supreme Court I AM the Constitution. The country elected me to lead, not be held back by ancient laws we can just change. We want jobs, a wall and to rip up the Iran deal. Period.\n\nIt should be fun to watch the liberals cry as Trump rips healthcare and public safety nets out from under the poor and forces them to work after abolishing the minimum wage. How high and mighty will all the lazy takers feel when they’re forced to work for $3 an hour and have to live in the dumpster behind the McDonalds they scrub?\n\nThis is change we can believe in, conservatives!

"Ghostly Car Advertisement Was Never Aired Because Of The Unexplained Event Caught On Camera\n686099 SHARES Share Tweet\n\nGhosts are a controversial topic. Some people believe in them and even swear they’ve seen them personally. Others think the whole idea is silly. Scientists view the matter with skepticism: they won’t be convinced until they see some seriously good evidence.\n\nSome years ago, a British camera crew was filming a television commercial for a car company. In the ad, a car makes its way along a winding road in a lovely, verdant stretch of countryside. Really makes you want to get behind the wheel and enjoy some scenery, doesn’t it? And of course, getting you behind the wheel was the whole point.\n\nThere’s a whole lot more to producing a commercial than just filming it. An editor has to work it over, taking great care to make sure everything is just right. They see the footage over and over and over again, always looking closely for the slightest problem. For the editor of this commercial, everything seemed pretty routine: just a car gliding through beautiful countryside. But then he noticed it. The “it” was moving along side the car. It looked like a bit of mist, but there was something, frankly, ghostly about it. Maybe it really was just mist but it sure looked spooky.\n\nImagine the looks on everyone’s faces when they found out that a year before, someone had been killed in an accident at the very spot where the “mist” starts appearing in the commercial. The people at the company that commissioned the ad were so freaked out, the commercial was never aired.\n\nWe’ve posted the video below. Remember, you have to pay very, very close attention. Watch very carefully. Make sure you read the intro.\n\nDid the ghost in this never-aired commercial give you a shock? Let us know in the Facebook comments and make sure to share and like so your friends get spooked, too.

"‘Smallville’ Star Confesses She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons\n‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.\n\nAccording to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.\n\nThefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.\n\nThe cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.\n\n“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”\n\nWhen these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.\n\nRaniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.\n\nIn 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.\n\nAlthough this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.\n\nA quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.\n\nAnother important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.\n\nTheir involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.\n\nAdditionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.\n\nNow that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.\n\nIn response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.\n\nFrank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.\n\n“She’s the enforcer—the brutal one. Clare’s running the [operation] now, and she’s the most ruthless of them. I’m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there’s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.” Parlato said.\n\nOf Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.\n\n“Mack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere’s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is ‘Pimp Mack,‘” Parlato said.\n\nIt is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack’s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called “Night Eyes Three.” She was just 11 years old at the time.\n\nBelow you can see the full charges against Mack and Raniere here.","https://yournewswire.com/smallville-star-sold-children-rothschilds-clintons/","1524960459.0"
"Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian\nWestern countries are being urged to intervene in a case where 6 young school girls facing execution for acting indecently at a friends house.\n\nFathima Al Kwaini and her friends that included three male friends have celebrated\n\nKwaini's\n\nbirthday at a friends house. A neighbor supposedly an assistant of an Imam of a mosque close by has reported this to Saudi Arabia's religious police. When the police arrived the girls were dancing with their male friends and they were arrested immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ultra conservative Arabian nation that has one of the worst human rights records is also a member of the United Nations Human Rights commission and recently got elected to the Women's Rights Commission as well which sparked anger and protest.\n\nAccording to HRW the girls were detained for more than a year before the trial and never confessed committing any crime. However the verdict of the 'male only' Sharia panel was that they need o be executed in accordance with the Sharia law. The boys were only advised 'not to be victimized' the report further states.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaudi uses methods such as beheading, stoning and crucifixion to execute women for crimes, including adultery, in the strict Islamic country.

"Starbucks Holds Hiring Event for Refugees in San Diego, TB Rates Among Highest in Country\nStarbucks held a hiring event exclusively for refugees in El Cajon, California on Tuesday, part of its recently announced commitment to hire more than 10,000 refugees over the next five years.\n\nEl Cajon is located in San Diego County, where more than 20,000 refugees have have been resettled by the federal government in the past nine and a half years since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2008.\n\nA 2013 study from a research team led by Dr. Timothy Rodwell, “an associate professor and physician in the Division of Global Health at UCSD [University of California at San Diego]” that “analyzed data from LTBI [latent tuberculosis infection] screening results of 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012,” noted that “San Diego County, in California, is a leading refugee resettlement site, and it also has one of the highest rates of active TB in the country, with an incidence rate of 8.4 cases per 100 000 people in 2011.” (The incidence rate in the entire population in the United States in 2016 was 2.9 per 100,000).\n\nThe study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, found that, of the 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County during the 34 months beginning in January 2010:\n\nNine hundred sixteen refugees (21.4%) in the study had a positive QFT-GIT result (Table 1). Of those, 823 (89.8%) had a normal chest radiograph and were diagnosed with LTBI (Figure 1). Sixty-one (6.7%) did not receive a chest radiograph; 14 (1.5%) had an abnormal result that was consistent with active TB; and 18 (2.0%) had an abnormal result that was not consistent with active TB.\n\nIn other words, the incidence of active TB among the 4,280 refugees who were resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012 was 327 per 100,000, more than 100 times greater than the incidence of active TB among the entire population of the United States in 2016.\n\nAbout four percent of the entire population of the United States tests positive for latent TB infection. Around 10 percent of those with LTBI will develop active TB at some point in their lives. The triggering mechanism to activate latent TB is not entirely understood, but high levels of stress, crowded living situations, poor public health practices, the presence of other diseases that lower the immune system, and behavioral conduct–such as smoking–appear to increase the chances of activation.\n\nThe 21.4 percent of refugees in the San Diego County study who tested positive for latent TB infection is about five times the national average.\n\nBreitbart News contacted Starbucks to learn if their refugee hiring process will include mandatory testing for latent and active TB, but has not received a response.\n\nThe Starbucks refugee hiring event will be held at the San Diego offices of the International Rescue Committee, one of the top nine voluntary agencies (VOLAGS) that are paid over $1 billion each year to resettle refugees in the United States.\n\nKGTV reported:\n\nAbout 30 Starbucks managers will conduct on-the-spot interviews at the International Rescue Committee’s office located at 131 E. Main Street in El Cajon from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 8. Applicants are encouraged to visit Starbucks online career center prior to the event and bring resumes along with them. The store managers will talk to the refugee applicants about what it’s like to work for Starbucks and review qualifications for the barista position. The world’s largest coffee chain said it would focus initial efforts on markets where refugee need is greatest and there’s a store base to meet the need. According to state and federal data, San Diego fits the bill. No other California county has received more refugees during the past decade than San Diego county. In 2016, San Diego settled 3,100 refugees, along with 520 military interpreters on special immigrant visas.\n\nCalifornia, like most states, requires TB testing for health care workers. Employees of restaurants are not required by California law to be tested for TB prior to hiring.","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/08/starbucks-holds-hiring-event-for-refugees-in-san-diego-tb-rates-among-highest-in-country/","1502164800.0"
