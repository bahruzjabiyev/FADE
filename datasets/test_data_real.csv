"Trump lawyer denies Deutsche Bank got subpoena on Trump accounts\nFRANKFURT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal investigator probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election asked Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) for data on accounts held by President Donald Trump and his family, a person close to the matter said on Tuesday, but Trump’s lawyer denied any such subpoena had been issued.\n\nGermany’s largest bank received a subpoena from Special Counsel Robert Mueller several weeks ago to provide information on certain money and credit transactions, the person said, without giving details, adding that key documents had been handed over in the meantime.\n\nDeutsche Bank has lent the Trump Organization hundreds of millions of dollars for real estate ventures and is one of the few major lenders that has given large amounts of credit to Trump in the past decade. A string of bankruptcies at his hotel and casino businesses during the 1990s made most of Wall Street wary of extending him credit.\n\nMueller is investigating alleged Russian attempts to influence the election, and potential collusion by Trump aides. Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that it meddled in the election and Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow.\n\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal lawyers, said Deutsche Bank has not received any subpoena for financial records relating to the president as part of Mueller’s probe.\n\n“We have confirmed that the news reports that the Special Counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false,” Sekulow told Reuters in a statement. “No subpoena has been issued or received. We have confirmed this with the bank and other sources.”\n\nHe later said the bank in question was Deutsche Bank. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\n\nA Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York had no immediate comment beyond the statement the bank issued earlier on Tuesday which said the bank takes “its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations into this matter.”\n\nA U.S. official with knowledge of Mueller’s probe said one reason for the subpoenas was to find out whether Deutsche Bank may have sold some of Trump’s mortgage or other loans to Russian state development bank VEB or other Russian banks that now are under U.S. and European Union sanctions.\n\nVEB, as well as the Russian Agricultural Bank and Gazprombank GZPRI.MM did not immediately reply to emailed requests for comment.\n\n“No one from the VTB Group (VTBR.MM) representatives has received a subpoena because there are absolutely no grounds for it,” a bank representative said in response to a request from Reuters. “Deutsche Bank did not contact us regarding people connected with the Trump administration.”\n\nRelated Coverage Trump lawyer: Deutsche Bank has not received subpoena for Trump records\n\n“We would not comment on the existence of any such request, had one been received,” responded a representative of Sberbank (SBER.MM).\n\nHolding Trump debt, particularly if some of it was or is coming due, could potentially give Russian banks some leverage over Trump, especially if they are state-owned, said a second U.S. official familiar with Russian intelligence methods.\n\n“One obvious question is why Trump and those around him expressed interest in improving relations with Russia as a top foreign policy priority, and whether or not any personal considerations played any part in that,” the second official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nA source close to Deutsche Bank said the bank had run checks on Trump’s financial dealings with Russia.\n\nDuring his election campaign, Trump said he would seek to improve ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which were strained during President Barack Obama’s administration.\n\nThe subpoena was earlier reported by German daily Handelsblatt.\n\nFINANCES A RED LINE\n\nDuring a photo opportunity with senators at the White House on Tuesday, Trump declined to answer shouted questions from reporters about whether Mueller had crossed a line by asking Deutsche Bank for information.\n\nIn a July 9 interview with the New York Times, Trump said Mueller should not extend his investigation into Trump’s finances if they were not directly related to the Russia accusations.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAsked if delving into his and his family’s finances unrelated to the Russia probe would cross a red line, Trump replied, “I would say yeah. I would say yes.”\n\nDeutsche Bank earlier this year rebuffed efforts by Democratic U.S. lawmakers to get more information on its dealings with Trump as well as any information it may have about whether the Republican, his family or advisers had financial backing from Russia.\n\nTrump had liabilities of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a unit of the German bank, according to a federal financial disclosure form released in June by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.\n\nThe Deutsche debts include a loan exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic property he redeveloped in downtown Washington, mortgages worth more than $55 million on a golf course in Florida, and a $25 million-plus loan on a Trump hotel and condominium in Chicago, the disclosure shows.\n\nAll of those loans were taken out in 2012 and will mature in 2023 and 2024, according to the disclosure.\n\nTrump and Deutsche Bank have not always been on good terms. Trump sued the bank and other lenders in 2008, demanding $3 billion in damages, claiming they broke agreements in the construction and financing of a Chicago hotel.\n\nDeutsche Bank countersued and the two sides eventually settled.\n\nInternal Deutsche Bank documents seen by Reuters feature the names of Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his wife, Kathleen, in a series of client profiles. But it was not immediately clear what their relationship with the bank is or had been.\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Manafort and his wife do not have Deutsche Bank accounts.\n\nThe bank declined to comment on whether Manafort is or has ever been a client.\n\nA spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.\n\nIn October, Manafort pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy against the United States. The charges were brought as part of Mueller’s investigation.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-deutsche-bank/trump-lawyer-denies-deutsche-bank-got-subpoena-on-trump-accounts-idUSKBN1DZ0XN","1512518059.0"
"North Korea Mulling Plan to Strike Guam, State Media Announces\nThat advance does not mean North Korea has a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile, according to a U.S. official briefed on the intelligence assessment. Pyongyang still has to establish that it can deliver a weapon accurately that survives reentry.\n\nNorth Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in late July in a test that the regime and independent experts said showed that some U.S. cities are now within its target range.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects the defense detachment on Jangjae Islet, in this undated photo released by KCNA on May 5, 2017. KCNA / via Reuters\n\nThe Department of Defense detected the ballistic missile launch and later confirmed it to be an ICBM, U.S. officials said. It flew approximately 1,000 kilometers and landed in the Sea of Japan, within Japan's exclusive economic zone, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council unanimously leveled new sanctions on North Korea on Saturday that could gut the regime's $3 billion annual export revenue by a third. The move was widely seen as punishment for the North's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called the resolution 'the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime' and 'the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation.'\n\nGuam Gov. Eddie Baza Calvo struck a calm and confident tone in a brief address posted to YouTube Wednesday aimed at allaying residents' fears.\n\n'I know we woke up to media reports of North Korea’s talk of revenge on the United States and this so-called new-found technology that allows them to target Guam,' Calvo said. 'I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island or the Marianas.'\n\nCalvo said 'there are several levels of defense, all strategically placed to protect our island and our nation,' and that he had spoken to the White House which affirmed that the U.S. would defend Guam as its own.\n\nThe island's governor said he nonetheless was convening a Unified Coordination Group as a result of the threat 'to discuss the state of readiness of our military and our local first responders.'\n\nIn Japan, a U.S. ally that is even closer to North Korea, officials struck a similarly measured tone.\n\nThe claim that North Korea can now miniaturize a nuclear weapon 'is something of great interest to us and we are constantly gathering new information and analyzing that data,' Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters Wednesday.\n\n'It is extremely important to strengthen the deterrence made possible by the Japan-U.S. alliance,' Suga said, adding that 'we are continuing to develop the cooperation between the two nations including this area of security.'\n\nRep. Madeleine Z. Bordallo, a Democrat who represents the territory in Congress, issued a statement calling North Korea's nuclear capabilities 'troubling,' but added, 'I am confident in the ability of U.S. defenses to protect our island and allies in the region.'\n\n'President Trump must work in partnership with the international community to de-escalate the growing tensions in the region and prevent North Korea from advancing its nuclear program further,' Bordallo continued, also calling on Trump to show 'steady leadership' as U.N. sanctions against North Korea are carried out.\n\nTrump has previously vowed to confront North Korea 'very strongly' for testing missile launches, telling reporters during a trip last month to Warsaw, Poland, that 'I have some pretty severe things that we’re thinking about,' in terms of potential responses.\n\nStella Kim reported from Seoul, Daniel Arkin reported from New York City, and Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-mulling-plan-strike-guam-state-media-announces-n790996","None"
"Suspect captured in 'heinous' Maryland workplace shooting that killed 3\nA man suspected of killing three co-workers today in Maryland has been captured in Delaware, officials said.\n\nRadee Labeeb Prince, 37, allegedly shot five people, killing three of them, at the Advanced Granite Solutions office in Edgewood, Maryland, Wednesday morning.\n\nPrince was caught Wednesday evening after a short foot chase in Newark, Delaware, after authorities received a tip that he had been seen, a law enforcement source told ABC News. Federal, state and local law enforcement officers descended on the neighborhood where he was seen, fanning out to look for him, the source said.\n\nThree agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spotted him on foot near the Four Seasons Parkway in Newark as he was smoking a cigar. When the agents approached him, he ran and dropped a gun, the source said. He was then quickly apprehended without incident, and authorities recovered the weapon.\n\nAuthorities would not have been able to apprehend Prince without efforts from the media and multiple law enforcement agencies as well as tips from civilians, Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy said at a press conference Wednesday night. Prince was being processed into jail late Wednesday, Tracy said.\n\nThe Harford County Sheriff's Office identified the three killed individuals as 53-year-old Bayarsaikhan Tudev, 34-year-old Jose Hidalgo Romero and 48-year-old Enis Mrvoljak. The two others shot at Advanced Granite Solutions remained in critical condition Thursday at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, police said. The identities of those victims have not yet been released.\n\nOn Wednesday just before 9 a.m., Prince entered the Edgewood facility, where he was an employee, according to Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler. Police were on the scene within six minutes of being notified, authorities said.\n\nA single handgun was used in the attack, police said, and Prince fled the scene in a 2008 black GMC Acadia with Delaware license plates.\n\nHe was also wanted in connection to a shooting in Wilmington, Delaware, Gahler said. The shooting was targeted, and Prince allegedly 'had beefs' with the person he shot there, Tracy said at an earlier press conference Wednesday.\n\nWilmington police said they received the first report of a shooting less than two hours after the shooting in Maryland. A person was shot twice — once near his head and once on his body — and is expected to survive, Tracy said.\n\nAfter the shooting in Wilmington, officers spotted Prince's vehicle, but they lost sight of it during a brief chase as it was heading north. His SUV was later found in Newcastle County, Delaware, Wednesday afternoon near a high school, police said. Authorities had received a tip that Prince was seen leaving his vehicle and walking toward the high school, Tracy said.\n\nPrince has a long criminal history, with 15 felony convictions and four misdemeanor convictions in Delaware, Tracy said.\n\nIn March 2015, Prince was charged in Cecil County with firearm possession with felony conviction as well as three related misdemeanors: possession of a firearm, illegal possession of ammunition and having a handgun in a vehicle, according to court records. It is unclear why the case ended without prosecution three months later.\n\nWJZ\n\nIn February of this year, a man named Philip Siason filed a petition for a peace order against Prince, court documents show. In his account of why he was filing, Siason said that Prince was an employee of his at JPS Marble & Granite in Forest Hill, Maryland, and that he fired Prince for 'punching another employee in the face.'\n\n'He came back to our business justifying what he did was right because the other guy was saying things he did not like,' Siason said in the documents.\n\nSiason said Prince later tried to collect unemployment benefits from the company, but the company told the unemployment agency that Prince was already working for another company. On Feb. 27, Prince 'cursed and yelled' at Siason about the unemployment benefits, Siason wrote in the filing.\n\n'I felt very threatened because he is a big guy [and] very aggressive on me,' Siason said, adding that while Prince did not injure him, he did 'not want to wait.'\n\nThe order was denied because the court said there was no statutory basis for relief and that Siason could not meet the required burden of proof.\n\nGahler said Prince targeted the Maryland home improvement business where he was an employee.\n\n'We know he worked here,' Gahler said. 'He was scheduled to be at work today.'\n\nHe added, 'We think it ties into the relationship here at work. I do believe he's targeting for a specific reason and not general.'\n\nAdvanced Granite Solutions' owner Barak Caba said in an interview with The Associated Press that Prince worked at the company as a machine operator for four months.\n\nKevin Doyle, 47, told ABC News he was standing next to his work truck in a parking lot next to Advanced Granite Solutions when he saw three employees running out the back of the building with a 'look of terror' on their faces.\n\nWJZ\n\nThe Harford County Sheriff's Office tweeted a photo of Prince while he was still on the lam.\n\nSEARCH for SUSPECT:\n\nRADEE LABEEB PRINCE 11/5/79\n\n2008 Black Chevy Acadia DE Tag PC064273\n\nCall 911 if you see the suspect. pic.twitter.com/v8y18FOEUi — Harford Sheriff (@Harford_Sheriff) October 18, 2017\n\nPrince is believed to have acted alone.\n\n'We do not believe anybody else is connected to the shooting,' Gahler said.\n\nPatrick SemanskyP\n\nThe Harford County Sheriff's Office is working with the FBI to investigate the shooting.

"In glyphosate review, WHO cancer agency edited out 'non-carcinogenic' findings\nLONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization’s cancer agency dismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of the weedkiller glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A French farmer drives his combine harvester as he harvests wheat in a field during sunset in Trescault, near Cambrai, northern France, August 5, 2015. To match Special Report WHO-IARC/GLYPHOSATE REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo\n\nDocuments seen by Reuters show how a draft of a key section of the International Agency for Research on Cancer’s (IARC) assessment of glyphosate - a report that has prompted international disputes and multi-million-dollar lawsuits - underwent significant changes and deletions before the report was finalised and made public.\n\nIARC, based in Lyon, France, wields huge influence as a semi-autonomous unit of the WHO, the United Nations health agency. It issued a report on its assessment of glyphosate - a key ingredient in Monsanto Corp’s top-selling weedkiller RoundUp - in March 2015. It ranked glyphosate a Group 2a carcinogen, a substance that probably causes cancer in people.\n\nThat conclusion was based on its experts’ view that there was “sufficient evidence” glyphosate causes cancer in animals and “limited evidence” it can do so in humans. The Group 2a classification has prompted mass litigation in the United States against Monsanto and could lead to a ban on glyphosate sales across the European Union from the start of next year.\n\nThe edits identified by Reuters occurred in the chapter of IARC’s review focusing on animal studies. This chapter was important in IARC’s assessment of glyphosate, since it was in animal studies that IARC decided there was “sufficient” evidence of carcinogenicity.\n\nOne effect of the changes to the draft, reviewed by Reuters in a comparison with the published report, was the removal of multiple scientists’ conclusions that their studies had found no link between glyphosate and cancer in laboratory animals.\n\nIn one instance, a fresh statistical analysis was inserted - effectively reversing the original finding of a study being reviewed by IARC.\n\nIn another, a sentence in the draft referenced a pathology report ordered by experts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It noted the report “firmly” and “unanimously” agreed that the “compound” – glyphosate – had not caused abnormal growths in the mice being studied. In the final published IARC monograph, this sentence had been deleted.\n\nReuters found 10 significant changes that were made between the draft chapter on animal studies and the published version of IARC’s glyphosate assessment. In each case, a negative conclusion about glyphosate leading to tumors was either deleted or replaced with a neutral or positive one. Reuters was unable to determine who made the changes.\n\nIARC did not respond to questions about the alterations. It said the draft was “confidential” and “deliberative in nature.” After Reuters asked about the changes, the agency posted a statement on its website advising the scientists who participate in its working groups “not to feel pressured to discuss their deliberations” outside the confines of IARC.\n\nReuters contacted 16 scientists who served in the IARC expert working group that conducted the weedkiller review to ask them about the edits and deletions. Most did not respond; five said they could not answer questions about the draft; none was willing or able to say who made the changes, or why or when they were made.\n\nThe chairman of the IARC sub-group tasked with reviewing evidence of glyphosate’s effect on laboratory animals was Charles Jameson, an American toxicologist. In testimony as part of personal-injury lawsuits against Monsanto in the United States, Jameson told lawyers for Monsanto he did not know when, why or by whom the edits had been made.\n\nMonsanto is facing multiple legal claims in the U.S. from plaintiffs who allege glyphosate gave them or their loved ones cancer. Jameson is an expert witness for the plaintiffs. He did not respond to questions for this article.\n\nScott Partridge, Monsanto’s vice president of global strategy, told Reuters the changes to the draft showed how “IARC members manipulated and distorted scientific data” in their glyphosate assessment.\n\nIARC declined to comment.\n\nNumerous national and international agencies have reviewed glyphosate. IARC is the only one to have declared the substance a probable carcinogen. Compared with other agencies, IARC has divulged little about its review process. Until now, it has been nearly impossible to see details, such as draft documents, of how IARC arrived at its decision.\n\nFILE PHOTO: External view of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France, June 12, 2017. To match Special Report WHO-IARC/GLYPHOSATE REUTERS/Robert Pratta/File Photo\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said that in its assessment of the weedkiller, the scientific decision-making process “can be traced from start to finish.” Jose Tarazona, head of EFSA’s pesticides unit, told Reuters: “Anyone can go to EFSA’s website and review how the assessment evolved over time. So you can see clearly how experts … appraised each and every study and also how comments from the public consultation were incorporated into the scientific thinking.”\n\nIn the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency published a full 1,261-page transcript of a three-day scientific advisory panel meeting on its ongoing evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate in December 2016.\n\nNo such record of the deliberations behind IARC’s monographs is published.\n\nIn a previous response to questions about the transparency of the IARC process, the agency’s director, Chris Wild, referred Reuters to a letter in which he said his agency’s assessments are “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process.” Wild also said IARC’s methods are intended to allow scientists to engage in free scientific debate at its monograph meetings.\n\nDELETIONS AND ADDITIONS\n\nIARC says its working group scientists are selected for “their expertise and the absence of real or apparent conflicts of interest.” For the panel that evaluated glyphosate and four other pesticides in what is known as IARC’s Monograph 112, scientists from 11 countries met at the agency’s headquarters in Lyon for a week-long meeting starting on March 3, 2015. The meeting “followed nearly a year of review and preparation” by IARC staff and working group members, “including a comprehensive review of the latest available scientific evidence,” IARC said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn June, Reuters reported how the chairman of the IARC working group was aware of new data showing no link between glyphosate and cancer in humans, but the agency did not take it into account because it had not been published.\n\nNo drafts of IARC’s glyphosate assessment have surfaced before. However, a draft was obtained by Monsanto as part of the legal proceedings in the United States. Reuters reviewed chapter 3, the section on animal studies, which is the only section no longer covered by a confidentiality order of the court.\n\nThe glyphosate review in IARC’s Monograph 112 runs to 92 pages; the chapter on animal studies consists of just over 10 pages. Reuters has not seen any other sections of the draft and cannot say whether they also underwent significant edits.\n\nIn comparing draft and final versions of chapter 3, Reuters found that in several instances comments in the draft were removed; the comments noted that studies had concluded glyphosate was not carcinogenic. They were replaced in the final version with the sentence: “The Working Group was not able to evaluate this study because of the limited experimental data provided in the review article and supplemental information.”\n\nThis sentence was inserted six times into the final version. Each time it replaced a contrary conclusion, noted in the draft, by the original investigators on the study being considered, such as: “The authors concluded that glyphosate was not carcinogenic in Sprague Dawley rats”; “The authors concluded that glyphosate technical acid was not carcinogenic in Wistar rats”; and “The authors concluded that glyphosate was not carcinogenic in CD-1 mice in this study.”\n\nReuters also found changes to the conclusions and statistical significance of two mouse studies. These studies were cited in IARC’s ultimate finding of “sufficient” evidence that glyphosate causes cancer in animals.\n\nOne edit concerned a 1983 study in mice. IARC’s published monograph contains a fresh statistical analysis calculation as part of its review of that study. The original investigators found no statistically significant link between glyphosate and cancer in the mice. IARC’s new calculation reached the opposite conclusion, attributing statistical significance to it.\n\nThis new calculation was inserted into the final published assessment, but was not in the draft version seen by Reuters. The change gave the working group more evidence on which to base its conclusion that glyphosate was probably carcinogenic.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIn further discussion of the same 1983 study, IARC’s final published report refers to expert pathologists on a panel commissioned to reanalyze the work of the original investigators. The IARC draft notes that these pathologists “unanimously” agreed with the original investigators that glyphosate was not related to potentially precancerous tissue growths in the mice. IARC’s final report deletes that sentence.\n\nReviewing a second mouse study, the IARC draft included a comment saying the incidence of a type of animal cancer known as haemangiosarcoma was “not significant” in both males and females. IARC’s published monograph, by contrast, inserts a fresh statistical analysis calculation on the data in male mice, and concludes that the findings were statistically significant.\n\nINFLUENTIAL MONOGRAPH\n\nIARC’s assessment that glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen is an outlier. In the 40 or so years since the weedkiller first came to the market, glyphosate has been repeatedly scrutinized and judged safe to use.\n\nA year after IARC issued its evaluation, a joint United Nations and World Health Organization panel reviewed the potential for glyphosate in food to cause cancer in people. It concluded the weedkiller was “unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.”\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which first assessed glyphosate in the 1980s and has reviewed it several times since, says it has “low toxicity for humans.” The European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Agency, which advise the 28 members of the EU, have also assessed glyphosate within the past two years and ruled it safe.\n\nBut IARC’s Monograph 112 has had great influence.\n\nIt is weighing heavily on a pending European Union decision – due by the end of the year and possibly to be made next week - on whether glyphosate should be relicensed for sale across the 28 member states. France, one of the bloc’s agricultural powerhouses, has said it wants the weedkiller phased out and then banned, provoking protests by its vocal farmers, who argue glyphosate is vital to their business.\n\nA failure to renew glyphosate’s license by the end of the year would see an EU ban kick in on Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nIn the United States, Monsanto – the firm that first developed and marketed glyphosate - is facing litigation in California involving at least 184 individual plaintiffs who cite the IARC assessment and claim exposure to RoundUp gave them a form of cancer known as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. They allege Monsanto failed to warn consumers of the risks. Monsanto denies the allegations. The case is ongoing.\n\nMembers of the U.S. Congress, concerned about what they described as IARC’s “inconsistent” standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, last year launched investigations into American taxpayer funding of IARC. The investigations are ongoing.\n\nIn Europe, IARC has become embroiled in a public spat with experts at the European Food Safety Authority, which conducted its own review of glyphosate in November 2015 and found it “unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.”\n\nWith IARC monograph meetings, some outside observers are selected and allowed to witness proceedings, but they are banned from talking about what goes on. Journalists are generally not allowed in.\n\nLast year, Reuters reported on an email sent by IARC to the experts on its glyphosate working group in which the agency advised them not to discuss their work or disclose documents. The email said IARC “does not encourage participants to retain working drafts or documents after the monograph has been published.”\n\nReuters sent questions about the draft version of the glyphosate assessment to members of the IARC working group that assessed the herbicide as well as to the head of IARC’s monograph program, Kurt Straif, and to Kathryn (Kate) Guyton, the staffer responsible for the glyphosate review. IARC responded by posting the following message on its website:\n\n“Members of the IARC Monograph Working Group which evaluated glyphosate in March 2015 have expressed concern after being approached by various parties asking them to justify scientific positions in draft documents produced during the Monographs process. IARC would like to reiterate that draft versions of the Monographs are deliberative in nature and confidential. Scientists should not feel pressured to discuss their deliberations outside this particular forum.”\n\nIARC answered none of Reuters’ specific questions about changes to the draft.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-who-iarc-glyphosate-specialreport/in-glyphosate-review-who-cancer-agency-edited-out-non-carcinogenic-findings-idUSKBN1CO251","1508441382.0"
"N.J. police chief said black people are ‘like ISIS’ and he’d like to be ‘on the firing squad,’ feds say\n\n\nFederal prosecutors have charged the former chief of a small township in New Jersey for slamming an African American teen’s head into a metal door jamb and saying that black people are “like ISIS.” (Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nThe former chief of a small township in New Jersey has been arrested on federal hate crime and civil rights charges for what federal authorities described as a pattern of racist comments and behavior — including slamming an African American teen’s head into a metal door jamb and saying that black people are “like ISIS.”\n\nFrank Nucera Jr., 60, who had been chief of the Bordentown Township Police Department, was arrested, and the charges against him were unsealed Wednesday. The allegations are notable for the blatant racism they describe in a law enforcement leader.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint in the case, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, Nucera frequently referred to African Americans by racial slurs and espoused violence toward them. In November 2015, for example, when he was talking to a subordinate officer about an African American man he believed to have slashed the tires of a police vehicle, Nucera said, “I wish that n‑‑‑‑‑ would come back from Trenton and give me a reason to put my hands on him, I’m tired of ’em. These n‑‑‑‑‑s are like ISIS, they have no value. They should line them all up and mow ’em down. I’d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it,” according to the complaint.\n\nNucera also used police dogs to intimidate African Americans, bringing canines to high school basketball games when his department was providing security and positioning them near the entrance to the gym, federal authorities alleged.\n\n[The Washington Post’s 2017 police shootings database]\n\nEfforts to reach Nucera’s family members were not immediately successful, and no lawyer was listed for him in court records. Federal authorities said Nucera retired from the police department shortly after New Jersey’s attorney general was informed of the investigation.\n\nIn 2014, Nucera was reportedly shot in the leg by his own gun after some kind of interaction with a preteen at the municipal building.\n\n[Sessions orders Justice Department to review all police reform agreements]\n\nCivil liberties advocates have criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for trying to undo efforts of the Obama administration to mandate reforms at police departments. President Trump’s top law enforcement official has ordered his department to review all the court-supervised reform agreements it has with police departments nationwide, saying it was necessary to ensure that these pacts do not work against the Trump administration’s goals of promoting officer safety and morale while fighting violent crime. He also rolled back a different Obama-era effort to investigate police departments and work with them out of court to fix their failings.\n\n[Justice Department ends program scrutinizing local police forces]\n\nBut Sessions has indicated a willingness to prosecute individual officers accused of wrongdoing. Nucera’s case — while so egregious it is hard to ignore — might provide some evidence of that. The charges were described in an affidavit signed by an FBI agent and approved by a federal prosecutor in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe physical violence of which Nucera is accused occurred in September 2016. According to the criminal complaint, the manager of a Ramada hotel called police to report that two African American teens, an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, had failed to pay for a hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool.\n\nWhen officers arrived, according to the complaint, the teens resisted arrest. One of the officers pepper-sprayed the 18-year-old, and both teens were eventually handcuffed and taken into custody, according to the complaint.\n\nSeveral minutes later, as officers were walking the 18-year-old toward a stairwell, the teen briefly stopped and began shouting, according to the complaint.

"What the police officer who shot Philando Castile said about the shooting\nThe officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop last year fired within seconds of learning that Castile was armed, according to a video recording released publicly on June 20. (Editor's note: This video contains graphic content.) (YouTube/Ramsey County)\n\nThe police officer said he had no choice.\n\nHours earlier, Jeronimo Yanez had fatally shot Philando Castile, who worked for a nearby school, during a traffic stop outside the Twin Cities. The officer said Castile kept moving even though he told him not to, reaching down and putting his hand on something.\n\n“I thought he had a gun in his hand,” Yanez said later. Yanez feared for his life, he said, and the lives of his partner as well as the two passengers in the car: Castile’s girlfriend and her young daughter. Recounting the shooting the following day, Yanez said: “I thought I was gonna die. And, I was scared because, I didn’t know if he was gonna, I didn’t know what he was gonna do.”\n\nSo he opened fire.\n\n[Video footage shows Minn. traffic stop that ended with Philando Castile’s death]\n\nThe encounter on Larpenteur Avenue in Falcon Heights, Minn., escalated to gunfire in a matter of seconds, and moments later, the scene began spreading worldwide, broadcast live on Facebook by Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, while she was sitting next to him in the car. She said Castile had been shot while reaching for his ID after letting the officer know he had a firearm.\n\nThe following day, Yanez — then a 28-year-old officer with the St. Anthony, Minn., police department — sat down to be interviewed by state investigators. Castile’s name dominated news headlines, his death in July 2016 the latest in a string of fatal police encounters that prompted outrage nationwide. Reynolds’s footage from inside Castile’s Oldsmobile, unlike any other account of a police shooting, was everywhere.\n\nYanez would be charged with manslaughter, with demonstrators decrying his actions, the state’s governor questioning the shooting and a county prosecutor assailing him. A jury acquitted him last week of manslaughter and two counts of endangering Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter. The same day, St. Anthony officials said Yanez would not return to their police force.\n\nFor most of the public, the only account they knew of the shooting was from Reynolds’s video, streamed live from the Oldsmobile while blood soaked into Castile’s white T-shirt. That changed Tuesday. Four days after Yanez was acquitted and nearly a year after Castile was killed, state officials released a police dashboard camera recording of the shooting itself, along with other recordings and scores of transcripts, reports and other documents.\n\nThe dash-cam video was shown during Yanez’s trial and its contents described in court documents, but the recording itself was not widely shared until Tuesday, when it rippled across social media, joining a catalogue of grim videos documenting police shootings from Cincinnati to North Charleston, S.C. The recordings and documents were released Tuesday “as they were presented in court, but without the context that we were able to provide at trial,” said a spokesman for Ramsey County Attorney John J. Choi, who prosecuted the case.\n\n[Minn. officer acquitted in shooting of Philando Castile during traffic stop, dismissed from police force]\n\nEarl Gray, an attorney for Yanez, did not respond to requests for comment regarding the acquittal last week or the evidence released Tuesday. After Yanez was acquitted, Gray told reporters outside the courthouse that “the case should’ve never been charged.”\n\nThis new video showed how quickly the encounter escalated, how fast it shifted when Castile told the officer about the gun he was legally carrying. Along with the footage of the shooting itself, officials also released another account of the shooting: a transcript of Yanez’s interview with two special agents from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency investigating the shooting.\n\nLike the dash-cam footage, Yanez’s comments during his interview were previously revealed in court documents and during his trial, but not widely seen. (According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, an audio recording of Yanez’s full interview with investigators was never played during the trial, and the judge denied a request from jurors to review a transcript during deliberations.) They capture a young officer who says he saw a gun and apparently connected his decision to open fire with the smell of marijuana in the car.\n\n[Thousands dead, few prosecuted]\n\nOn July 7, about 16 hours after fatally shooting Castile, Yanez sat down with the investigators. Yanez told them he stopped Castile not for a broken taillight, as he told the driver when the stop began, but because he thought Castile matched the description of a suspect in a robbery days earlier.\n\nThe first thing he noticed when approaching the car, Yanez told investigators, was the smell of burning marijuana, according to the verbatim transcripts of the interview.\n\n“I told them the reason for the traffic stop and then I wasn’t going to say anything about the marijuana yet because I didn’t want to scare him or have him react in a defensive manner. Um, he didn’t make direct eye contact with me and it was very hard to hear him, Uh he was almost mumbling when he was talking to me. And he was directing his voice away from me as he was speaking and as I was asking questions. Uh he kept his, hands in view and then I uh I believe I asked for, his license and insurance. And then I believe they told me, they asked for the reason for my traffic stop. And I told ’em the reason was the only, I think I told ’em the only rea, the reason I pulled you over is because the only active brake light working was the rear passenger side brake light.”\n\nThe traffic stop quickly shifted, Yanez said, when Castile told him he had a gun. Outside the car, Yanez could be seen sliding his hand onto his gun. According to Yanez, at the same time, he saw Castile “reaching down between his right leg, his right thigh area and the center console.”\n\nDiamond Reynolds, Philando Castile’s girlfriend, during Officer Jeronimo Yanez’s trial. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nThe officer told investigators later that the marijuana smell remained in his mind, saying that because of the odor, he didn’t know whether Castile had the gun “for protection” from a drug dealer or people trying to rob him.\n\nThe dash-cam video showed what happened next. Yanez told Castile not to reach for the gun, and Castile said he was not reaching for it, which Reynolds echoed. Yanez yelled: “Don’t pull it out!” Yanez drew his gun, pushed it inside the car and fired seven shots.\n\n[‘He knew the kids and they loved him’: Castile was an adored school cafeteria manager]\n\nReynolds’s Facebook Live video began moments later, and the dash-cam continued recording from inside Yanez’s car. Neither video captured Castile’s movements inside his car in the moments before he was shot.\n\nAccording to Yanez, before he opened fire, Castile kept moving his hand. From the transcript:\n\nYanez: “I, believe I continued to tell him don’t do it or don’t reach for it and he still continued to move. And, it appeared to me that be had no regard to what I was saying. He didn’t care what I was saying. He still reached down. … And, at that point I, was scared and I was, in fear for my life and my partner’s life. And for the little girl in the back and the front seat passenger and he dropped his hand down and, can’t remember what I was telling him but I was telling something as his hand went down I think. And, he put his hand around something. And his hand made like a C shape type um type shape and it appeared to me that he was wrapping something around his fingers and almost like if I were to put my uh hand around my gun like putting my hand up to the butt of the gun.” Investigator: “Okay.” Yanez: “That’s what it appeared to me.”\n\nYanez then said he kept seeing Castile moving his hand and “saw something in his hand,” adding that the driver “had no regard for what I was saying. Didn’t follow my direction.”\n\n\n\nOfficer Jeronimo Yanez during his trial. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nIn the video recordings, Reynolds can be heard disputing this from inside the car, saying that Castile, who had been asked for his license when the stop began, was reaching for his ID, not for a gun.\n\nYanez, though, said he believed Castile had grabbed a gun:\n\n“I know he had an object and it was dark. And he was pulling it out with his right hand. And as he was pulling it out I, a million things started going through my head. And I thought I was gonna die. And, I was scared because, I didn’t know if he was gonna, I didn’t know what he was gonna do. He just had somethin’ uh his hands and he, the first words that he said to me were, some of the first words he said is that he had a gun. And I thought he was reaching for the gun. I thought he had the gun in his hand, in his right hand. And I thought he had it enough to where all he had to do is just pull it out, point it at me, move his trigger finger down on the trigger and let off rounds. And I had no other option than, to take out my firearm and, and I shot. Um I shot him.”\n\nYanez said he did not remember the first two shots, but he remembered the last two. He also said he tried directing his gunfire “down as best I could,” to avoid Reynolds and her daughter. In his interview, Yanez said again moments later that he thought he saw Castile’s gun in his hands, and when asked about this later, Yanez said it looked to him like Yanez’s hand was “wrapped around the butt of a gun.”\n\n“I just knew it was dark and I could barely see and I thought it was a firearm and I thought he was gonna shoot and kill me and I thought he was gonna shoot and kill my partner right after that.”\n\nIn describing his decision to fire, Yanez brought up the marijuana again, saying the smell was on his mind when he began shooting:\n\n“As that was happening as he was pulling at, out his hand I thought, I was gonna die and I thought if he’s, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care does he give about me. And, I let off the rounds and then after the rounds were off, the little girls was screaming.”\n\nYanez said he did not remember seeing anything in Castile’s hands after the gunshots. According to court records, officers and paramedics removed a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun from Castile’s pocket once he was taken out of the car; the gun had a loaded magazine but no round chambered.\n\n[Looking at officer’s claims about safety concerns regarding marijuana]\n\nLater, Yanez was asked again about what he perceived as Castile’s “general disposition.” The officer said Castile’s body language “appeared defensive to me,” and then described the interaction this way:\n\n“As I was giving him direction about what to give me and to keep his hand in view um like I said I felt that he had no regard to what I was saying. He didn’t care what I was saying. He didn’t want to follow what I was saying so he just wanted to do what he wanted to do.”\n\nYanez was also asked later about his previous experience with drivers who say they have firearms, and he said that drivers “always tell me that when they’re gonna reach for something and where their wallets at or what they’re gonna do.”\n\nIn the dash-cam video, moments after he is mortally wounded, Castile can be heard saying: “I wasn’t reaching.” It is the last time he is heard speaking on the dash-cam recording.\n\n[Yanez was model student, educator says]\n\nLarry R. Rogers Jr., an attorney for Reynolds, said that based on the dash-cam video, “it is clear that Officer Jeronimo Yanez was not in control, was nervous and acted in a reckless, willful and wanton fashion.”\n\n“We are exploring our next steps in light of the compelling evidence of Officer Yanez’s wrongdoing that led to this tragedy,” Rogers said in a statement.\n\nExperts said that while videos of police shootings are disturbing, the legal standard is still whether an officer’s actions were “objectively reasonable” given the situation they were facing, according to Graham v. Connor, the 1989 U.S. Supreme Court case.\n\n“Video may give us some insight on [shootings], but it doesn’t change the fundamental standard by which police actions using force are judged,” David A. Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert in police uses of force, said this week.\n\nThe Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop was acquitted on all charges by a jury on June 16, nearly a year after his death. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nVideos are also inevitably incomplete, because they are unlikely to capture the entire incident, he said.\n\n“The officer’s judged by what he or she reasonably sees or perceives,” said David J. MacMain, an attorney and former Pennsylvania State Trooper who represents law enforcement officers in civil cases. “It’s the perception of the officer at the time.”\n\nPolice in the United States fatally shot 963 people last year, essentially unchanged from the previous year, according to a Washington Post database tracking the shootings. Most of those shot and killed last year were armed, the database showed.\n\n[Gun owners are outraged by the Philando Castile case. The NRA is silent.]\n\nThe dash-cam video from Castile’s death last year in Minnesota, along with other evidence released Tuesday and another video made public Wednesday, provided additional glimpses of what happened outside of the Facebook Live video.\n\nNot long after the gunshots, Officer Joseph Kauser, Yanez’s partner at the time, is seen approaching the car’s rear passenger door and picking up Reynolds’s 4-year-old daughter, who was sitting behind Reynolds in the back seat. Photographs from inside the car, presented later as evidence, showed that one bullet passed through Castile’s seat and struck the back seat, inches from where the girl was sitting in her car seat.\n\nYanez can be heard yelling out a series of expletives, even as Reynolds, speaking into her phone, was saying: “They killed my boyfriend. He’s licensed … he is licensed to carry.”\n\nInside Castile’s wallet were his license, credit cards and his permit to carry a pistol, according to a photo included in the evidence collection.\n\nAbout five minutes after he was shot, Castile was pulled from the car and laid down on the street, where officers began to administer first aid.\n\nAnother video, this one apparently recorded inside another police car, showed a different angle of the shooting’s aftermath. Reynolds was placed in the car along with her daughter, and Reynolds, still handcuffed, described what happened into her phone. Reynolds’s voice grew increasingly emotional, her anger apparent.\n\n“It’s okay, I’m right here with you,” the 4-year-old said to Reynolds. The 4-year-old began crying, and Reynolds tried to console her. Minutes later, Reynolds yelled while having an issue with her phone, and the 4-year-old again tried to console her.\n\n“Mom, please stop saying cuss words and screaming ’cause I don’t want you to get shooted,” she said. Reynolds gave her a kiss, and the girl added: “I could keep you safe.”\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings in 2017\n\nFor Diamond Reynolds, trying to move past 10 tragic minutes of video\n\nProtocol for reducing police shootings draws backlash from unions, chiefs group","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/21/what-the-police-officer-who-shot-philando-castile-said-about-the-shooting/","1498017600.0"
"Jerusalem UN vote: Trump threatens US aid recipients\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: 'We're watching those votes'\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that back a United Nations resolution opposing the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Trump took that step amid international criticism.\n\n'They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us,' he told reporters at the White House.\n\n'Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care.'\n\nHis comments come ahead of a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution opposing any recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nThe draft resolution does not mention the US, but says any decisions on Jerusalem should be cancelled.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Fourteen states backed a similar motion on Jerusalem at the UN Security Council on Monday\n\nEarlier, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley warned member states that President Trump had asked her to report on 'who voted against us' on Thursday.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York\n\nPresident Trump and Ambassador Haley are trying to use American muscle rather than diplomacy to convince countries to vote their way. From Washington's perspective, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and deciding to move its embassy there is its sovereign right.\n\nBut that's not how the majority of countries at the United Nations see it.\n\nThe strongest repudiation came, unsurprisingly, from Washington's critics.\n\nMeanwhile, many US allies are brushing off the tough rhetoric as an empty threat.\n\nA senior diplomat told me it was clear that the Trump administration was determined to take a stand for Israel at the UN, but he doubted that Washington would cut aid to, say, Egypt - which sponsored the failed Security Council measure on which the General Assembly draft resolution is based.\n\nWhat is certain is that the US will be isolated in the General Assembly on Thursday as the rest of the world once again tells President Trump that it does not agree with his decision on Jerusalem.\n\nThe status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIsrael occupied the east of the city, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why the city of Jerusalem matters\n\nThe Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.\n\nIsraeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy.\n\nThe 193-member UN General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month.\n\nThe Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution, which affirmed that any decisions on the status of Jerusalem were 'null and void and must be rescinded', and urged all states to 'refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the holy city'.\n\nThe other 14 members of the Security Council voted in favour of the draft, but Ms Haley described it as an 'insult'.\n\nThe non-binding resolution put forward by Turkey and Yemen for the General Assembly vote mirrors the vetoed Security Council draft.\n\nThe Palestinian permanent observer at the UN, Riyad Mansour, said he hoped there would be 'overwhelming support' for the resolution.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Ms Haley warned in a letter to dozens of member states that encouraged them to 'know that the president and the US take this vote personally'.\n\n'The president will be watching this vote carefully and has requested I report back on those countries who voted against us. We will take note of each and every vote on this issue,' she wrote, according to journalists who were shown the letter.\n\n'The president's announcement does not affect final status negotiations in any way, including the specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem,' she added. 'The president also made sure to support the status quo of Jerusalem's holy sites.'\n\nMs Haley echoed the warning on Twitter, writing: 'The US will be taking names.'\n\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki and his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused the US of intimidation.\n\n'We see that the United States, which was left alone, is now resorting to threats. No honourable, dignified country would bow down to this pressure,' Mr Cavusoglu told a joint news conference in Ankara on Wednesday before travelling to New York.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42431095","None"

"Breaking bread and building bonds: Refugees host new American neighbors\nMaplewood, New Jersey (CNN) Fatimah Alghazawi bursts through the door bearing plastic crates packed with food for a dinner she's spent two days preparing.\n\nHer new friend Maryam al Radi has her hands full, too. They are carrying more than 15 dishes in aluminum containers, plus the elaborate garnishes they will add on top.\n\nThey haven't met the people they'll be entertaining -- their new neighbors -- but then that's the point of the Syria Supper Club. The group hosts dinners where refugees cook elaborate meals from their home countries for locals in the New Jersey communities where they've settled. The dinners have been taking place since December 2015, when Kate McCaffrey and Melina Macall, members of a local synagogue, wanted to do something about the refugee crisis. They began hosting them with the goal of empowering the recent arrivals and building bonds with their new neighbors.\n\n'(Refugees) come here and they are perceived as victims,' Kate says. 'We want to just put them on an equal footing and let them be sort of the center of a beautiful meal as opposed to the recipients of financial assistance.'\n\nIt's about removing the stigma of what it means to be a refugee, Kate says. This week they dine at her house in Maplewood, New Jersey.\n\n'I think people need that now more than ever, especially post-election,' Kate says, nodding to Donald Trump's rhetoric on Muslims during his campaign and the recent executive order barring travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. 'People want this, they want a place to show a commitment to diversity and to American values.'\n\nThey fled the same city, only to meet in America\n\nMaryam and Fatimah prepare food in the kitchen before guests arrive.\n\nMaryam is comfortable in Kate's kitchen. She's cooked for these dinners before, and they joke with each other like old friends. But it is Fatimah's first time. She and her family have only been in America for eight months. Both fled from Daraa, Syria, where uprisings mushroomed against the government. Both of them spent years in Jordan before landing on US soil: Maryam was there for three years, Fatimah for four.\n\nThough they hail from the same city, the two women hadn't met until they came to America. They've bonded over the overwhelming challenges involved in leaving behind their homes and struggling to assimilate.\n\nJUST WATCHED How two Americans are helping a Syrian family resettle Replay More Videos ...

Her 7-year-old child suffered trauma from the event, prompting them to flee.\n\nBut she doesn't mention that now. Instead, she is in the kitchen with Fatimah fussing over every last detail of this meal that means so much to them. They have few opportunities to have real, meaningful conversations with their new neighbors.\n\nThe doorbell rings. The first guests arrive and the kitchen becomes crowded, but there's a palpable sense of uncertainty: How should they all talk? Who should go first? Maryam and Fatimah, and a few of the guests who are also refugees, speak little English; their U.S.-born guests speak no Arabic.\n\nAn apology on behalf of America\n\nGuests listen as introductions are made at the start of the Syria Supper Club.\n\nAbout 25 people walk into the dining room to a massive display of food. Fatimah and Maryam beam with pride as the guests marvel at the spread.\n\nThere are bright purple spicy pickles, crisp stuffed grape leaves and tabbouleh. Each aluminum pan is filled to the brim with layers of food. Almost every dish is sprinkled with seasoning, or adorned with colorful peppers. A pattern is etched into the hummus and filled with oil for dipping. All the dishes, laid out one next to the other on trivets, cover the length of the entire wooden dining table.\n\nAfter a brief introduction, Melina, one of the founders of the supper club, broaches the subject of Trump's executive order. 'We all know that the executive order is weighing very heavily on us right now, in particular the travel ban, for our Syrian friends and their families,' she says. 'This might seem just like a little dinner but it's really important. It brings people together.'\n\nAn interpreter crosses the room throughout the evening, jumping between conversations and helping everyone understand each other.\n\n'(Fatimah) ... wishes there wasn't the language barrier,' the interpreter says. 'Because she's meeting people, but she's not really meeting them. She's not able to converse.'\n\nFatimah points at the other side of the room.\n\n'See how much they're talking and sharing ideas, she wishes she could do that,' the interpreter explains.\n\nWe are not necessarily what our government says.

Maryam is 'very happy to be here in America because she met people who treat her like a person,' she says.\n\n'[I am] happy to come here to meet people who treated [us] very kindly. We hope we are able to come out of the trouble we are in, and thank you,' Fatimah says.\n\nRecent NYU graduates and roommates Anna Chen and Jessica Guo found out about the event on social media. Jessica says this dinner was just what she needed: a 'communal way to say welcome.'\n\n'And I also wanted to add that, despite what our government might be saying, we are not necessarily what our government says. This is America,' Jessica says. 'And welcome.'\n\nThe cooks of the night nod as Jessica's message is translated to them.\n\n'I love American people, despite of their government,' Maryam says. The room erupts in laughter, lightening the mood made heavy by the current political climate.\n\nAmy Koehler, another guest, introduces herself and says her only regret is not having done this sooner.\n\n'Also, welcome,' Amy says with a sigh. 'I'm sorry.'\n\nMaryam responds swiftly through the interpreter. 'She says thank you, and no need to be sorry.'\n\nDinner and a discovery\n\nMaryam and Fatimah present the meal for the night.\n\nMaryam and Fatimah are not the only refugees present at dinner that night; 29-year-old Hayder Alqaysi has been in America for 10 months, after he and his family fled Baghdad. His mom and his sister Noor are here, too.\n\nHayder and other guests close to his age try to find common ground. Film, TV, sports. They settle on the Australian Open. Federer or Nadal? They go back and forth like a tennis ball during a match.\n\nThe moms among the group are talking, too. They take out their phones and show each other photos of their children, which need no translating.\n\nDoreen Panzer, 51, is here tonight because her youngest daughter Sophie, a senior in high school, has been tutoring young Syrian refugees in Newark. Doreen was inspired to do something herself.\n\nShe texts her daughter at the table about how eye-opening the dinner has been. The two exchange a few more texts, and Doreen learns that Sophie has been tutoring Maryam's children this whole time. Neither of them realized it until a few hours into the dinner.\n\nIt is difficult...but this is good life for us. Noor Alqaysi\n\nAnna comes over to the table where Noor is sitting among most of the parents and pulls up a chair. They talk about travel, the frustration of using chopsticks, and religion. They are close in age; Anna is 21 and Noor is 25. Anna says she wants to host a dinner like this one day.\n\nNoor speaks briefly about life before America. Her father has been missing in Iraq since 2007. Once Noor graduated, she, her brother Hayder and her mother left the country to escape the fighting there. They traveled to Turkey and then on to America.\n\n'It is difficult, that they are there and we are here, but this is good life for us now,' Noor says.\n\nDessert with a slice of humble pie\n\nMaryam and Doreen embrace at the end of the Syria Supper Club dinner.\n\nOn the kitchen counter a bright orange sweet coconut cake signals it's time for dessert.\n\nDoreen and Amy sit down in the dining room, alone together for a minute, taking in all they have learned. They say they are surprised that, after all the families from Iraq and Syria have been through, they have spent so little of this evening dwelling on their tragedy.\n\n'Someone's father is missing. Can you imagine if it was us? If our father was missing?' Doreen says. 'We would not be able to function at this dinner table. And yet there is something about their resilience. They are actually stronger than us.'\n\nMaryam joins them at the table. They ask about the meaning of an Arabic phrase that Maryam used earlier to describe her dreams for her life in America: 'Inshallah,' or 'God willing.'\n\n'Sometimes, Americans, we're obsessed with the future, what will it hold,' Doreen says. 'And [these women], there is no privilege of future. It is in a sense a beautiful and enlightened moment, it's moment to moment for them. It's God's will.'\n\nYou have strength more than you know, Doreen Panzer\n\n'You're in our country and there's this perception I'm going to teach you, I'm going to tell you about America, about the way things are,' Doreen says to Maryam. 'But it's actually sobering that, no, you are teaching me.'\n\nThe interpreter relays that Maryam wants to thank her for being open-minded. 'That requires a certain personality. You could have been like 'Oh, they're Muslims, I'm not going to talk to them,'' the interpreter says.\n\n'Not here!' the American women say.\n\nThey ask Maryam about her life in Syria, and the interpreter, who has gotten to know Maryam at a few of these dinners, tells them about Maryam's house being bombed, her child being traumatized. It is too emotional, she says, for Maryam to tell again and again.\n\nThe table is silent. The women reach their hands over and clasp Maryam's hands. She wipes a tear from her face.\n\n'You have strength more than you know,' Doreen tells her.\n\nThe women hug and kiss on the cheek before they leave for the night.\n\nAs Maryam walks away they ask whether there are things these women need, supplies for their homes. The interpreter says, for Maryam at least, she's got six boys, so her biggest need is clear: Detergent.\n\nThey all burst out laughing, reminded of how similar they are.\n\nAs they clear the tables and put away extra food, Hayder sits alone in the living room looking at his phone. He turns the phone to show what he's doing. He's typing in all the English words he heard tonight to find the translation and add them to a running list. He adds words he wants to be able to use next time.\n\n'I learn more each time,' he says. 'I will get better. It will get better.'","https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/us/syria-supper-club/index.html","1485925200.0"
"Catalonia: hundreds of thousands join anti-independence rally in Barcelona\nPolice say 350,000 have protested against regional government’s separatist course, but organisers say 930,000 joined in\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets of Barcelona to protest against the Catalan government’s decision to push for independence, as Spain’s prime minister warned that he was prepared to suspend the region’s autonomy to stop it splitting from the rest of the country.\n\nSunday’s rally – organised by Societat Civil Catalana, the region’s main pro-unity organisation – comes a week after the independence referendum that has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades.\n\nEndlessly refighting old wars does nothing to heal a fractured present | Will Hutton Read more\n\nThe march, whose slogan is “Let’s recover our common sense”, was intended to call for a new phase of dialogue with the rest of Spain and featured such luminaries as the Nobel-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa and Josep Borrell, former president of the European parliament.\n\nSocietat Civil Catalana said more than 1 million people had taken part, but Barcelona police put the turnout at 350,000.\n\nThe Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, is under growing pressure to stop short of declaring independence. The political uncertainty has already led some businesses – including Spain’s third-largest bank – to move their bases from Catalonia.\n\nAccording to the Catalan government, 90% of participants voted for independence in the referendum, 7.8% voted against and almost 2% of ballot papers were left blank.\n\nPuigdemont is due to appear in the Catalan parliament on Tuesday to “report on the current political situation” and to put the referendum results to MPs.\n\nThe move – seen as an attempt to circumvent the Spanish constitutional court’s ban on a similar session scheduled for Monday – could potentially provide an opportunity for the region’s promised unilateral declaration of independence.\n\n“I hope that nothing will happen,” Juliana Prats, a Barcelona resident taking part in the protest, told Associated Press.\n\n“[Catalonia] is going to lose more than [Spain] because businesses are fleeing from here already. I hope it will remain like it has been up until now: 40 years of peace.”\n\nVargas Llosa, who was born in Peru but has Spanish citizenship, told the rally: “Besides Catalans, there are thousands of men and women from all corners of Spain who have come to tell their Catalan companions that they are not alone. We want Barcelona to once again be the capital of Spanish culture.”\n\nSaturday saw marches and demonstrations all over the country, with tens of thousands gathering in Madrid’s Plaza Colón in favour of a united Spain. In dozens of towns and cities, including Barcelona, people joined the “white demonstrations” demanding dialogue. Dressed in white and without any flags, protesters marched under the single slogan in Spanish and Catalan: Hablemos/Parlem – “let’s talk”.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with El País on Sunday, Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, insisted he would stop the Catalan government declaring independence over the coming days, warning that the Spanish authorities would assume control of the region from Madrid if necessary.\n\nRajoy said the thousands of Guardia Civil and national police officers deployed in Catalonia would remain there “until things return to normal” and repeated calls for the regional government to drop its independence demands.\n\n\n\n“We’re going to stop independence from happening,” he told the paper. “I can say with absolute frankness that it’s not going to happen. Depending on how things develop, we’ll obviously take any of the decisions the law permits.\n\n“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: as long as the threat of a declaration of independence remains on the political horizon, it’s going to be very difficult for the government not to take steps.”\n\n\n\nAsked if he would invoke article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which would allow the Madrid government to step in and take control of Catalonia, he replied: “I am ruling out absolutely nothing when it comes to the law. I will do what I have to do when the time comes and that’s the most important thing at the moment.\n\n“The ideal thing would be to not have to adopt drastic solutions, but to avoid that there would have to be some changes.”\n\nRajoy described the Catalan independence crisis as an issue for Europe as a whole.\n\n\n\n“This is a European battle,” he said. “It’s a battle in which the values of Europe are at stake. I am convinced that all the governments will carry on supporting the constitution and obedience to the law.”\n\n\n\n‘Hunt for Catalans’ threat on London Spanish Facebook group page Read more\n\nThe Spanish prime minister once again stressed that there could be no negotiations whatsoever until Puigdemont’s government stepped back from the brink.\n\n“I will not negotiate until there is a return to legality,” Rajoy told El País. “The prime minister of an advanced, democratic country can’t negotiate with someone who flouts the law. As soon as there are changes, we’ll be back to a different and normal situation – just as we have been over the past 40 years in which a lot of things have been negotiated.”\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the Elders – an independent group of global political leaders – said recent events could jeopardise the democratic progress Spain had made since the death of Francisco Franco in 1975.\n\n“The constitutional crisis that is unfolding in Spain calls for consultation and not confrontation,” said the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, who is the chair of the Elders.\n\n“I urge the Spanish government and the regional government of Catalonia to renew their commitment to a resolution through dialogue. They must find a peaceful path out of this crisis.”\n\nHundreds of people were reported to have been injured during last Sunday’s referendum, which saw police officers raiding polling stations, beating voters and firing rubber bullets at crowds. The vote had been declared illegal by both the Spanish authorities and the constitutional court.\n\nAlthough he admitted that “things could have been done better or worse”, Rajoy defended the police’s actions and said the authorities had a duty to defend the constitution.\n\n\n\nDespite the Spanish authorities’ efforts to stop the referendum, 2.3 million of Catalonia’s 5.3 million registered voters took part, although many Catalans who oppose independence boycotted the poll for fear of lending it legitimacy.\n\n\n\nA full count of the votes has been complicated by the fact that police removed many ballot boxes from polling stations. The regional government said police had shut down polling stations where up to 770,000 people could have voted.\n\n","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/08/catalonia-spain-prime-minister-refuses-rule-out-suspending-autonomy","1507435200.0"
"Ululations, tears as white Zimbabwean farmer returns to seized land\nRUSAPE, Zimbabwe (Reuters) - The last time white Zimbabwean farmer Rob Smart left his land it was at gunpoint, forced out in June by riot police armed with tear gas and AK-47 assault rifles.\n\nHe returned on Thursday to ululations and tears of joy from former workers and their families who were also kicked out - a jubilant return and the first sign that the president who has replaced Robert Mugabe is making good on a vow to stop illegal land seizures and restore property rights.\n\nScores of jubilant black Zimbabweans nearly knocked the 71-year-old off his feet as he and his two children stepped out of their car and onto their land for the first time in six months.\n\nSmart’s case was taken up by Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe’s then vice-president who heard of Smart’s violent eviction while at an investment conference in Johannesburg.\n\nMnangagwa became president last month following a de facto coup that ended 93-year-old Mugabe’s rule. In the latter half of his 37 years in power, Zimbabwe’s economy collapsed, especially after the seizure of thousands of white-owned commercial farms under the banner of post-colonial land reform.\n\nLand ownership is one of Zimbabwe’s most sensitive political topics. Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 leaving many blacks effectively landless.\n\nTwenty years later, Mugabe authorized the violent invasion of many white-owned farms and justified it on the grounds that it was redressing imbalances from the colonial era.\n\nWhite farmers complained that well connected people used state security forces to force them off their farms, sometimes in the middle of harvesting, even after the Mugabe government indicated, some four years ago, that land seizures were over.\n\n“We are overjoyed, over the moon. We thought we would never see this day coming,” Smart’s son, Darryn, told Reuters.\n\n“Getting back to the farm has given not just us, but the whole community hope that it’s a new Zimbabwe, a new country.”\n\nRob Smart, whose father said he started the farm from “virgin bush” in 1932, expressed confidence in the new government’s pledge to protect the commercial farming sector, a mainstay of the struggling economy.\n\n“It’s early days but so far what they (the new government) said they are going to do they are doing,” he told Reuters.\n\n“We just hope this whole incident will give hope to other farmers, who’ve had the same situation.”\n\nCommercial farmer Darreyn Smart is welcomed at Lesbury Estates by village elders and children at a farm in Headlands communal lands east of the capital Harare, Zimbabwe, December 21, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo\n\n“NO CONFUSION”\n\nMnangagwa, who is under pressure to revive the economy ahead of elections next year, said on Thursday that he was resolute about the changes he was introducing.\n\n“There is no business as usual. Things have changed, it’s a new era,” he said at a meeting with business leaders in South Africa.\n\n“I’m from the military. If it’s ‘left turn’ then it’s ‘left turn’. If it’s ‘right turn’ it’s ‘right turn’. No confusion.”\n\nMnangagwa’s new agriculture minister, Perrance Shiri, last week ordered illegal occupiers of farms to vacate the land immediately, a move that could ultimately see some white farmers who say they were unfairly evicted return to farming.\n\nShiri, a military hardliner who was head of the air force before being picked for the crucial ministry this month, called for “unquestionable sanity on the farms”.\n\nFor 83-year-old Anna Matemani, whose late husband worked on the farm, Smart’s return was long overdue.\n\n“I’m so happy he is finally back. He always helped us and the farm provides jobs for many of our young people,” said the grandmother of 15, who grew up and raised her children on the farm and witnessed Rob’s birth, wiping away tears.\n\nSome of the Smarts’ joy subsided as they walked into their ransacked farmhouses.\n\nThe occupiers had looted property, including clothes, the children’s toys, three guns, bottles of 100-year-old wine and Smart’s late father Roy’s medals from when he served with the Police Reserve Air Wing in the former Rhodesia.\n\n“I’m sad about my grandfather’s medals,” Darryn Smart said, surveying a ransacked room.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n“You can buy tables and chairs, you can’t buy that family history. But thank goodness we’re here.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-politics-farmer/ululations-tears-as-white-zimbabwean-farmer-returns-to-seized-land-idUSKBN1EF2US","1514062464.0"
"Here are the details of the final GOP tax bill\nHouse and Senate Republicans on Friday released the final text of their legislative agreement on taxes, after negotiators from both chambers worked out the differences between their two bills. Significantly, the final agreement eliminates the individual mandate penalty under Obamacare, something the original Senate bill did but the House bill did not.\n\nThe success of the final legislation looked more likely Friday, after Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, said he would vote for the bill, and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, seemed to have his concerns about the generosity of the child tax credit satisfied. The House is expected to vote on the legislation Tuesday, and the Senate after that.

The overall child tax credit will increase from $1,000 to $2,000.\n\nRoughly doubles the standard deduction, from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals, and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly\n\nPreserves the child adoption tax credit\n\nAllows filers to write off the cost of state and local taxes, but only up to $10,000. Filers must choose from among sales, income and property taxes for the deduction, instead of being able to deduct all local taxes.\n\nPreserves the mortgage interest deduction for all homeowners with existing mortgages, and for homeowners with new mortgages, the home mortgage interest deduction will be available up to $750,000\n\nPreserves the charitable deduction as it is\n\nThe GOP claims the bill will mean a $2,059 tax cut for a family of four earning the median family income of $73,000.\n\nCBS News' Catherine Reynolds and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/final-gop-tax-agreement-released/","None"
"TSA fails most tests in latest undercover operation at US airports\nIn recent undercover tests of multiple airport security checkpoints by the Department of Homeland Security, inspectors said screeners, their equipment or their procedures failed more than half the time, according to a source familiar with the classified report.\n\nInterested in TSA? Add TSA as an interest to stay up to date on the latest TSA news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nWhen ABC News asked the source if the failure rate was 80 percent, the response was, 'You are in the ballpark.'\n\nIn a public hearing after a private classified briefing to the House Committee on Homeland Security, members of Congress called the failures by the Transportation Security Administration disturbing.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers went as far as to tell TSA Administrator David Pekoske, 'This agency that you run is broken badly, and it needs your attention.'\n\nPekoske was confirmed by the Senate this summer.\n\nInspectors 'identified vulnerabilities with TSA's screener performance, screening equipment and associated procedures,' according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe statement added that the findings remain classified but that eight recommendations have been made to the TSA to improve checkpoint security. It is not clear what those recommendations are.\n\nThe news of the failure comes two years after ABC News reported that secret teams from the DHS found that the TSA failed 95 percent of the time to stop inspectors from smuggling weapons or explosive materials through screening.\n\nThat report led to major changes ordered at the TSA by then–Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The agency opened a training academy for transportation security officers and changed procedures to reduce long lines.\n\nAlthough lawmakers described the TSA's performance in this round of testing as poor, it was an improvement from two years ago, according to the source familiar with the report.\n\nIn the public hearing today on Capitol Hill, members pushed for the full implementation of a program using new scanning equipment that creates a 3-D image of bags, giving screeners better ability to spot possibly dangerous items.\n\nThe equipment is being tested in TSA checkpoints in at least two airports, but software and installation challenges have slowed wider implementation.\n\nRep. Bill Keating suggested that money is being diverted from the agency to build President Trump's promised border wall.\n\n'We have the technology and resources to do it, but we're not doing it because ... we're paying for a wall,' Keating said.\n\nHe also noted that Viper teams, specially trained Homeland Security units that use canines to secure transportation facilities, are being cut from 31 to eight.\n\nIt is not clear when the report will be released publicly.\n\nThe TSA said in a statement that it 'concurs with the DHS OIG [Office of Inspector General] findings and is committed to aggressively implementing the recommendations.'\n\n'We take the OIG's findings very seriously and are implementing measures that will improve screening effectiveness at checkpoints,' Pekoske said.

"Exclusive: U.S. asks Israel to restrain response to Jerusalem move - document\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is asking Israel to temper its response to the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as its capital because Washington expects a backlash and is weighing the potential threat to U.S. facilities and people, according to a State Department document seen by Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nAn Israeli flag is seen near the Dome of the Rock, located in Jerusalem's Old City on the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount December 6, 2017. REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\n“While I recognize that you will publicly welcome this news, I ask that you restrain your official response,” the document dated Dec. 6 said in talking points for diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to convey to Israeli officials.\n\n“We expect there to be resistance to this news in the Middle East and around the world. We are still judging the impact this decision will have on U.S. facilities and personnel overseas,” the document said.\n\nA second State Department document seen by Reuters, which was also dated Dec. 6, said the agency had formed an internal task force “to track worldwide developments” following the U.S. decision on Jerusalem.\n\nA U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was standard to set up a task force “any time there is a concern about the safety and security of U.S. government personnel or U.S. citizens.”\n\nThe State Department had no immediate comment on either document.\n\nTrump reversed decades of U.S. policy by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imperilling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting U.S. friends and adversaries alike.\n\nThe first document also laid out talking points for officials at the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem, the U.S. Embassies in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome and the U.S. mission to the European Union in Brussels.\n\nIn its message for the European capitals, the document asked European officials to argue that Trump’s decision did not prejudge so-called “final status” issues that Israel and the Palestinians need to hammer out in any peace agreement.\n\n“You are in a key position to influence international reaction to this announcement and we are asking you to amplify the reality that Jerusalem is still a final status issue between Israelis and Palestinians and that the parties must resolve the dimensions of Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem during their negotiations,” it said.\n\n“You know that this is a unique Administration. It makes bold moves. But it is bold moves that are going to be needed if peace efforts are finally going to be successful,” it said.\n\nThe status of Jerusalem, home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions, is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.\n\nIsrael considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of their own to be in the city’s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognised internationally.","https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-israel-document/exclusive-u-s-asks-israel-to-restrain-response-to-jerusalem-move-document-idUKKBN1E106T","1512612906.0"
"‘I’m not playing, Mister Officer’: Gunman appears to complain about police mistreatment in video months before shooting NYPD officer\nA New York City police officer was shot and killed in an “unprovoked attack” as she was sitting in a marked police vehicle early Wednesday in the Bronx, authorities said.\n\nOfficer Miosotis Familia was inside the large vehicle — known as a mobile command post — with her partner at 12:30 a.m. when a gunman fired through a window and struck Familia in the head, police said. The city’s police commissioner called the shooting an assassination.\n\nFamilia, a 12-year NYPD veteran, was taken to a hospital in extremely critical condition, police said. Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill announced on Twitter several hours later that Familia had died. Familia’s partner was not wounded in the attack.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday afternoon, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Familia was “unjustly targeted and murdered in a cowardly, unprovoked attack.”\n\n“She will be remembered for her years of service and for the example of selflessness that she set protecting people on our streets,” Sessions said. “This murder in cold blood is a tragedy, and sadly it is the latest in a troubling series of attacks on police officers over the past two years.”\n\nPolice said Familia was wrapping up her shift when the gunman fired. “My partner’s shot! My partner’s shot! My partner’s shot! Hurry up central!” her partner was heard screaming into a police radio, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTwo other officers confronted the suspected gunman about a block away from the scene of the shooting, police said. The shooting suspect was shot and killed after he drew a revolver, police said. He was identified by authorities as 34-year-old Alexander Bonds.\n\nAlexander Bonds (New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision)\n\nA bystander was shot during that encounter. Police said that person is in stable condition.\n\nIt remains unclear what prompted the attack, officials said. A police spokesman said Familia did not know Bonds.\n\nTen months earlier, Bonds posted an 11-minute video to his Facebook page that complains about mistreatment at the hands of officers during his incarceration, and he suggested that he would fight a police officer if he encountered one on the street.\n\nIn addition to the robbery, Bonds served more than six months in prison in 2004 for selling a controlled substance.\n\n“I’m not playing, Mister Officer. I don’t care about a hundred police watching this s—shit. You see this face. You see this face or anything, leave it alone. Trust and believe,” he said in the video.\n\n“I’m not hesitating. It ain’t happening,” Bond added. “I wasn’t a b—- bitch in jail, and I’m not going to be a b—- bitch in the streets.”\n\nA law enforcement official told The Washington Post that the NYPD believes the video to be authentic and is investigating it further.\n\nBonds, who also went by the name John Bonds, was paroled in May 2013 after serving seven years for robbery in Onondaga County, according to the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. He also served more than six months in prison in 2004 for selling a controlled substance.\n\nThe shooting was reminiscent of the 2014 killings of two New York police officers who were shot at point-blank range while sitting in a police car in Brooklyn.\n\n“It’s clear that this was an assassination,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time. “These officers were shot execution-style, a particularly despicable act which goes to the heart of our society and our democracy.”\n\nAuthorities said the gunman in the 2014 ambush had declared his intention on Instagram to kill officers as retribution for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, black men who were killed by police that year.\n\n[NYPD: Attacker dead after report of ‘several people shot’ at Bronx Hospital]\n\nThe Dec. 20, 2014, killings of NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos inflamed tensions between the city’s police force and de Blasio, who during his 2013 mayoral campaign had strongly criticized the department’s “stop-and-frisk” tactic. After the ambush, police union officials accused the Democratic mayor of feeding anti-police sentiment. The rift prompted hundreds of police officers to turn their backs as de Blasio spoke at the funeral of one of the two slain officers.\n\nIn 2016, law enforcement fatalities spiked to their highest level in five years, with 135 officers killed in the line of duty, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that monitors line-of-duty deaths. The rising death toll rattled police officers nationwide.\n\nAmbushes dominated the news after a pair of July 2016 attacks in which eight officers were shot in what authorities described as targeted attacks fueled by anger over how police use force on minorities.\n\nAn ambush in Dallas on July 7, 2016 — the deadliest single day for law enforcement since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks — targeted officers patrolling a protest over deadly police shootings in Baton Rouge and Falcon Heights, Minn., over the preceding days. Five officers were killed and nine others wounded before police killed the attacker.\n\n[Two New York City police officers are shot and killed in a brazen ambush in Brooklyn]\n\nTen days later, another attacker sought out law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, killing two police officers and a sheriff’s deputy before he was felled by a sniper. Officials said in a report released last week that the gunman had researched the officers involved in the deadly shooting of Alton Sterling, a black man killed outside a Baton Rouge store in an incident partially captured on video.\n\nIn November, two Iowa police officers sitting in their squad cars were killed in a pair of ambush attacks. A San Antonio officer writing a ticket was ambushed and killed not long after.\n\nThese episodes helped fuel an uptick in police officer deaths last year, with 64 officers fatally shot, a 41 percent increase from the previous year, according to the Memorial Fund. Nearly one in three officers fatally shot was killed in what were deemed to be ambush attacks like those in Dallas and Baton Rouge.\n\n#NYPD PO Miosotis Familia has been assassinated in an unprovoked attack on cops assigned to keep NYers safe. Keep her family in your prayers pic.twitter.com/yhRB7H5bvi — Commissioner O'Neill (@NYPDONeill) July 5, 2017\n\nOverall, law enforcement line-of-duty deaths have declined since the 1970s, when twice as many police officers were fatally shot each year and twice as many officers were killed annually. Still, in recent years, police have said they feel demonized by protests against how law enforcement officers use deadly force. Demonstrations have erupted in cities such as New York, Baltimore, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and San Francisco after high-profile killings by officers.\n\nBefore 2016, traffic-related incidents — rather than shootings — were the leading cause of police deaths for most of the past two decades. Last year, nearly half of all police officer deaths were gun-related, the largest share in any year since 1994.\n\nSo far this year, at least 65 officers have been killed — a 25 percent increase over the same period last year, according to the Memorial Fund. Nearly half of them were killed by gunfire, but the overall increase in fatalities was largely fueled by what the fund called “other causes,” which can include boating accidents and illnesses.\n\nI offer my deepest condolences to Officer Familia's loved ones and fellow members of the NYPD.

God bless her family & the NYPD. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 5, 2017\n\nFamilia, 48, joined the New York Police Department in July 2005. She was a mother of three, said Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association.\n\nIn a statement, Lynch said of Familia:\n\n[She] gave her life protecting a neighborhood that had been plagued by gang gun violence. Fully knowing the dangers that she faced, she suited up in uniform every day and stood tall against those who threaten and terrorize the good folks of the Bronx. As we mourn her death and support her family, friends and colleagues, we ask for your help. Violence against police officers cannot stand. When you see or hear someone making threats against NYC police officers you need to let us know, you need to be our eyes and ears.\n\nVivian Gomez, who lived in the same Bronx apartment building as Familia, said Wednesday morning that she’d heard about a police officer who was shot, but she did not know until a Washington Post reporter contacted her that the slain officer was her upstairs neighbor.\n\n[Ambushes and fatal shootings fuel increase in police death toll this year]\n\nShe didn’t know Familia well, Gomez said, but they often saw each other in passing.\n\n“When our paths crossed, she was either coming to or from work; I know she loved the job,” Gomez told The Post. “I never heard her say a negative thing about her job. Oftentimes, people would gripe about the hours, the long days. I never heard her say, ‘I dislike my job’ or ‘It’s tough.’ She always had a smile on her face.”\n\nGomez said Familia appeared to be devoted to her children.\n\n“She always seemed to be a very caring mother. … Every time I saw her, she had her kids,” Gomez said. “They all seemed to be a very close-knit family. I found her always to be a very warm spirit.”\n\nA relative reached by The Post on Wednesday declined to comment.\n\n“It’s just an unfortunate situation in the time we live in, where cops are targeted,” Gomez said of Familia’s death. “I know there’s a lot of distress about lack of justice in our community. … She’s a real face behind the badge.”\n\nPeter Holley and Julie Tate contributed to this report, which has been updated.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nOfficers at New York precinct told not to shower at station after fears of Legionnaires’ disease\n\nA black off-duty cop tried to help stop a crime.

"In NATO Speech, Trump Is Vague About Mutual Defense Pledge\n“This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,” he added. “And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.”\n\nStanding before a large piece of twisted wreckage from the World Trade Center that will serve as a memorial at the headquarters, Mr. Trump promised to “never forsake the friends that stood by our side” in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks — a pledge that White House officials later said was an affirmation of mutual defense.\n\nBut to European leaders, Mr. Trump’s words fell far short of an explicit affirmation of NATO’s Article 5 clause, the “one-for-all, all-for-one” principle that has been the foundation of the alliance since its establishment 68 years ago, after World War II.\n\n“I think he was stingy with the U.S. commitment and very generous with his criticisms,” said Fabrice Pothier, a former head of policy planning at NATO and a senior associate at Rasmussen Global, a political consulting firm.\n\nWhite House officials said Mr. Trump’s message on financial contributions had galvanized NATO to confront the issue. At a closed meeting after his speech, they said, the leaders unanimously approved a resolution on burden-sharing and on fighting terrorism.\n\nVideo\n\n“To see unanimous support for the two main priorities of the president is a great way to start it off,” said Sean Spicer, the press secretary. “When you have an entire meeting that is focused on the president’s agenda, that shows the power of his message.”\n\nPublicly, though, the other leaders appeared less gratified than bewildered. During a photo-taking session, none of them spoke to Mr. Trump, except for the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Afterward, several surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has emerged as the strongest counterweight to the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Trump, a blunt critic of the European Union during his campaign, received a chilly reception from his European counterparts as they began meetings in Brussels.\n\nHis first meeting with the Continent’s leaders began with officials from the United States and Europe saying nothing to each other. After being welcomed to Brussels, Mr. Trump said, “Thank you very much,” but he was otherwise silent as he gazed at the cameras across the room.\n\nDonald Tusk, who represents leaders of the bloc’s 28 member states as president of the European Council, made it clear after the morning meeting that there had been several areas of disagreement.\n\n“Some issues remained open, like climate and trade,” Mr. Tusk said after the meeting at the European Union’s lavish new headquarters. “And I am not 100 percent sure that we can say today — ‘we’ means Mr. President and myself — that we have a common position, common opinion, about Russia.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn the talks, Mr. Trump and Mr. Tusk differed over the intentions and policies of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. That reflects growing anxiety in Europe over what appear to be Russia’s efforts to meddle in elections here and in the United States.\n\nThe subject of Russia did not come up in a broader meeting between American and European officials, said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council. But Mr. Anton said he could not speak for a smaller meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Tusk and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe White House put a more positive spin on the day, saying the leaders had discussed ways to deepen cooperation in fighting the Islamic State and reaffirmed “the strong bond between the United States and Europe, anchored in shared values and longstanding friendship.”\n\nClimate change is another bone of contention, however. European leaders are turning up the pressure on Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate accord that was ratified last year.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe campaign began on Wednesday at the Vatican, where Pope Francis gave Mr. Trump a copy of his influential encyclical on protecting the environment, and the Vatican’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, urged the president not to withdraw from the accord.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump told Vatican officials that he had not made a final decision and that he was not likely to do so until after a Group of 7 meeting this weekend in Taormina, Sicily, according to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The president’s senior advisers have been deadlocked for months over whether the United States should withdraw.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was among those who said he planned to press Mr. Trump on climate change.\n\n“One of the things that we understand in Canada is that investing in clean energy and investing in fighting against climate change is going to help us,” Mr. Trudeau said, citing efforts by governments and businesses to find ways to avoid polluting the planet.\n\nMr. Trump’s handling of Article 5 epitomizes the gulf between him and other leaders. His steadfast refusal to endorse it as a candidate, and later as president, has raised fears among NATO allies about whether the United States would come to their defense in the event of an attack.\n\nOther American officials have offered reassurances. Mr. Tillerson told reporters traveling on Air Force One this week, “Of course we support Article 5.” But until Mr. Trump speaks those words, leaders of other NATO nations seem bound to remain concerned.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump criticized the other leaders for not contributing 2 percent of their countries’ gross domestic product to their defense, as they have agreed to do but have often fallen short of. He even took a shot at the new headquarters, a vast glass-and-steel edifice that looks like a series of interconnected airplane hangars.\n\n“I never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost,” Mr. Trump said. “I refuse to do so. But it looks beautiful.”\n\nIn 2014, NATO members agreed to increase their defense spending gradually to meet the 2 percent of G.D.P. goal, with 20 percent of that spending on military equipment. Those commitments have not changed, and after remaining flat in 2015, spending increased last year among non-American alliance members.\n\nThe alarm in Europe over Mr. Trump’s presidency has diminished since the days immediately after his election, in part because emissaries like Mr. Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence have reaffirmed American support for NATO and the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Trump, who once described Brussels as a “hellhole” overrun with radicals, remains an object of deep suspicion in the city.

"Merkel, After Discordant G-7 Meeting, Is Looking Past Trump\n“This seems to be the end of an era, one in which the United States led and Europe followed,” said Ivo H. Daalder, a former United States envoy to NATO who is now the director of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “Today, the United States is heading into a direction on key issues that seems diametrically opposite of where Europe is heading. Merkel’s comments are an acknowledgment of that new reality.”\n\nMs. Merkel’s emphasis on the need of Europe to stand up for its own interests comes after Mr. Trump declined to publicly endorse NATO’s doctrine of collective defense or to agree to common European positions on global trade, dealing with Russian aggression or mitigating the effects of climate change.\n\n“We have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans,” Ms. Merkel said.\n\nMs. Merkel, who did not mention Mr. Trump by name, also spoke of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, which means the bloc will lose its second-largest economy and one of its two nuclear powers. Britain’s departure will also weaken trans-Atlantic ties and leave the Continent more exposed than before.\n\nGiven this new context for international relations, she said, “I can only say that we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands — of course in friendship with the United States of America, in friendship with Great Britain and as good neighbors wherever that is possible also with other countries, even with Russia.”\n\nWith her statement, she seemed to be calling for German voters to get accustomed to a more active European role — and to more involvement by Berlin in crises on the Continent as well as global ones affecting Europe’s future. Ms. Merkel is seeking a fourth term as chancellor ahead of parliamentary elections in September.\n\nMs. Merkel was known to have been unsettled by her meetings with Mr. Trump in Washington in March, and she had been concerned that if Marine Le Pen won the French presidency this month, Germany would be isolated and the European Union badly damaged.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Macron, who was meeting Mr. Trump for the first time, appeared to have a less negative impression of the outcome of the talks than Ms. Merkel. In a news conference at the end of the Group of 7 conference, Mr. Macron took a glass-half-full approach, saying that he believed, over all, that despite Mr. Trump’s earlier hostile language toward NATO, multilateralism was intact and there was a shared vision in a number of areas.\n\nMr. Trump campaigned on a platform of trade protectionism, nationalism and skepticism about multilateralism and climate change — all issues on which most European leaders disagree with him. Europeans also depend on NATO for their ultimate defense and are more concerned about an increasingly aggressive Russia than Mr. Trump seems to be, although his defense secretary and national security adviser, both senior military officers, insist that the president is fully behind NATO’s Article 5, which requires all members to come to the defense of any country in the alliance that is attacked.\n\nMr. Daalder said: “This is ‘America first’ — a policy focused on narrow self-interest — and abandons the idea that the best way to enhance our security and prosperity is by having strong allies and leading globally in pursuit of common values and interests.”\n\nAs they traveled back to the United States over the weekend, White House officials said Mr. Trump had succeeded in delivering a blunt message about self-reliance to American allies in Europe.\n\nThey said the president’s decision to scold the NATO member countries about their contributions to the defense alliance would reduce the need for the United States to carry the financial burden for the Continent’s defense. And they said the president’s tough position on trade would help protect American companies from unfair practices.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Trump “has changed the way many people around the world are thinking about these issues.”\n\nWhite House officials expressed little concern about the personal interactions between the president and other heads of state. The administration official said Mr. Trump had built “an extraordinary rapport with the other leaders.”\n\nMs. Merkel seemed particularly upset with Mr. Trump’s refusal to endorse language supporting free trade and backing the Paris climate accord in the Group of 7 declaration after talks in Taormina, Sicily. There have been reports that Mr. Trump intends to abandon the 195-nation climate deal agreed upon in 2015, arguing that it hurts the American economy.\n\nThe climate accord was the most vivid sign of division between the United States and its allies. But Mr. Trump, in Brussels, also repeated comments that Germany was “very bad” because of its trade surplus and the fact that some German car companies manufacture in Mexico for importing into the United States, even though many of them produce cars in American factories with American workers.\n\nVideo\n\nOn Saturday, Ms. Merkel was unusually direct in discussing what she called unsatisfying talks on climate change, which is an important issue for many German voters and a hallmark topic for the chancellor, who first made her mark in the 1990s shepherding an international accord on the environment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Merkel’s disappointment on the issue was not entirely shared by Mr. Macron, who said Mr. Trump had at least listened to the arguments of the other Group of 7 leaders.\n\nMs. Merkel, however, sounded a somewhat bleaker note. “The whole discussion about climate was very difficult, not to say unsatisfactory,” she said. “There’s a situation where it’s six, if you count the European Union, seven, against one.”\n\n“This is not just any old agreement, but it is a central agreement for shaping globalization,” she said. “There are no signs of whether the U.S. will stay in the Paris accords or not.”\n\nMr. Macron told the French news media that his now-famous handshake tussle with Mr. Trump was a deliberate effort to show that he could not be pushed around by the American president. He told the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche that it was “a moment of truth” — designed to show that he is no pushover, and a message for the European Union leadership, as well.\n\n“My handshake with him — it wasn’t innocent,” Mr. Macron said. “One must show that you won’t make small concessions, even symbolic ones, but also not over-publicize things, either.”\n\nThe budding Merkel-Macron relationship is important, and Ms. Merkel has moved quickly to embrace him, conscious that he must still try to win a legislative majority in elections next month to be an effective partner. The European Union has traditionally been at its strongest when its two biggest continental powers work closely in tandem.\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Merkel and her top aides held a bilateral meeting on Friday night in Sicily with Mr. Macron and his top officials, German officials said. Most strikingly, the spouses of the two leaders also attended. It is rare for Ms. Merkel’s husband, Joachim Sauer, to accompany her on trips abroad — something she said recently that he decides. Brigitte Macron is new to the role of France’s first lady, but Mr. Macron has credited her with giving him valuable political advice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn general, Mr. Macron — who will meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday at Versailles, outside Paris — has stressed friendship with Germany, appointing German speakers to critical positions, including prime minister, chief foreign policy adviser and defense minister. The newly elected president also kept the tradition of paying his first official visit to Berlin, doing so on his first full day in office.\n\nAs for Mr. Trump, he says the trip was a resounding success. On Sunday, after being restrained on Twitter while abroad, he returned to form, unleashing a barrage of posts. Among them: “Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!”\n\nMr. Daalder disagreed. “The president’s failure to endorse Article 5 in a speech at NATO headquarters, his continued lambasting of Germany and other allies on trade, his apparent decision to walk away from the Paris climate agreement — all suggest that the United States is less interested in leading globally than has been the case for the last 70 years,” he said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/world/europe/angela-merkel-trump-alliances-g7-leaders.html","1495944000.0"

Those who pay are asked to send confirmation of payment to an email address. However, that email address has been shut down by the email provider.\n\n“We do not tolerate any misuse of our platform,” said the German email provider Posteo in a blog post.\n\nThis means that there is no longer any way for people who decide to pay the ransom to contact the attacker for a decryption key to unlock their computer.\n\n“This is not an experienced ransomware operator,” said Ryan Kalember, senior vice-president of cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint.\n\nThe attack was first reported in Ukraine, where the government, banks, state power utility and Kiev’s airport and metro system were all affected. The radiation monitoring system at Chernobyl was taken offline, forcing employees to use hand-held counters to measure levels at the former nuclear plant’s exclusion zone.\n\nThe food giant Mondelez, legal firm DLA Piper, Danish shipping and transport giant AP Moller-Maersk and Heritage Valley Health System, which runs hospitals and care facilities in Pittsburgh, also said their systems had been hit by the malware.\n\nWPP said in a statement that the computer systems at several of its subsidiary companies had been affected, adding that it was “assessing the situation and taking appropriate measures”.\n\n\n\nIn an internal memo to staff, one WPP firm said it was the target of “a massive global malware attack, affecting all Windows servers, PCs and laptops”. It warned employes to turn off and disconnect all machines using Windows.\n\nSome technology experts said the attack appeared consistent with an “updated variant” of a virus known as Petya or Petrwrap, a ransomware that locks computer files and forces users to pay a designated sum to regain access.\n\nBut analysts at cyber security firm Kaspersky Labs said they had traced the infections to “a new ransomware that has not been seen before”. The “NotPetya” attack had hit 2,000 users in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the US, Kaspersky said.\n\nAnis (@0xUID) Kaspersky Lab analysts say new attacks are not a variant of #Petya ransomware as publicly reported, but a new ransomware they call NotPetya! pic.twitter.com/zLwKNOR2VL\n\nLast month’s WannaCry or WannaCrypt ransomware attack affected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, with the UK’s national health service, Spanish phone giant Telefónica and German state railways among those hardest hit.\n\n\n\nSymantec cyber security experts said they had confirmed the ransomware in the current attack was using the same exploit – a program that takes advantage of a software vulnerability - as WannaCry.\n\nThe exploit - called EternalBlue - was leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group in April and is thought to have been developed by the US National Security Agency.\n\nTo spread within companies that installed the patch to protect themselves against WannaCry, the Petya ransomware appears to have two other ways of spreading rapidly within an organisation, by targeting the network’s administrator tools.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how computers became infected with the ransomware in the first place, but it doesn’t seem to be through email as happened with WannaCry, said Kalember.\n\nPictures circulating on social media on Tuesday of screens purportedly affected by the attack showed a message stating, “Your files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted,” and demanding a $300 ransom in the Bitcoin digital currency.\n\n\n\nAnkit singh (@ankit5934) New #ransomware spreading through SMB...

"Opioid commission unveils new partnerships, drug supply limits to stop epidemic\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie held the third formal meeting of President Trump's ongoing Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and Opioid Crisis, where officials in the pharmaceutical industry and government detailed new partnerships and efforts in the hopes of limiting the use of opioid prescriptions for combatting pain and recommending new treatments for pain management without the use of addictive substances.\n\nNational Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins advised the commission that the agency is looking to build partnerships with researchers across academia, government, prescribers and patients to 'cut in half the time needed to make available prescriptions that are non-addictive.'\n\nHe said areas like developing 'potent but non-addictive drugs' for pain relief and offering new avenues for treatment would become a top priority for the partnership.\n\nCollins noted that similar efforts have been taken on by NIH with regard to both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease and said the body 'can do the same with opioids.'\n\nPhRMA CEO Stephen J. Ubl also announced another significant step in the effort to curb the abuse of opioid prescriptions, telling the commission that the company will support limiting the supply of opioids to 7 days, as opposed to the traditional 30-day supply for short-term pain management and minor treatments.\n\n'Over-prescribing can lead to excess pills falling into the wrong hands,' said Ubl. He added, 'given scope of this crisis, we believe it's the right thing to do.'\n\nUbl called it a 'candidly an unprecedented step for the industry' and commended the efforts of the Trump administration for being comitted to making a maximum effort to the public health emergency.\n\nChristie applauded the effort by PhRMA, calling the crisis a 'prevention measure as much as anything else to make sure we don't turn people into addicts inadvertently.'\n\nHe added, 'The fact the pharmaceutical industry is admitting this, is an important first step to limit the amount of these drugs that are out there that can be used inappropriately.'\n\nU.S. WorldMeds' Senior Director also advised the commission that they are awaiting feedback on the filing acceptance and priority review request from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the development of their new drug Lofexidine. If approved by FDA, it would be the first and only non-narcotic product used for the treatment of opioid withdrawal.\n\nSo far, the effort to end the epidemic has been off to a rocky start after the commission failed to make a deadline to file an interim report on the crisis for the second time back in July.\n\nChristie had also missed a previous meeting with Mr. Trump on the epidemic, which was held in Christie's home state while the governor was away on a family vacation in Italy this past summer.\n\nThe governor has since traveled to a veterans hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, along with Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, which has been able to lower the rate of opioids prescribed to veterans by more than double digit amounts by recommending alternative therapy and treatment programs.\n\nChristie said by changing the culture inside hospitals, it shows that 'opioids are not the first resort for pain management' and helps lower the prescription rate for medications.\n\nThe commission, however, has a new deadline of November 1st for their final report on the epidemic and recommendations for which the industry can innovate pain management and addiction prevention measures. Conway said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump 'very much anticipates' the commission's final report and is expecting many agencies across his cabinet to 'pitch in.'\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump, who attended the previous meeting in New Jersey, is expected to hold a listening session on Thursday with experts and people affected by the opioid crisis.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioid-commission-unveils-new-partnerships-drug-supply-limits-to-stop-epidemic/","None"
"California gunman failed to access elementary school classrooms in shooting spree, authorities say\nThe gunman who went on an apparently random shooting spree in rural Northern California allegedly left an elementary school after he failed to access classrooms there, authorities said.\n\nFour people were killed and 10 more were wounded in a series of shootings Tuesday morning in Tehama County. The shootings took place in seven locations, including at the Rancho Tehama School, an elementary school in Corning, about 130 miles north of Sacramento, police said, but no children were killed.\n\nTen people were hospitalized, including at least two children, police said. One student was shot inside a classroom at the school, while the other injured child was shot while sitting in a truck when the shooter drove by, police said.\n\nThe shooter rammed a fence at the gate of the school before entering the grounds with a semi-automatic rifle, Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said in a press conference Tuesday afternoon. The school's gate had been locked, the Corning Union Elementary School District said in a statement.\n\nThe suspect was wearing a vest with clips attached to it, similar to ones often worn by U.S. soldiers, and fired 30 or so rounds at a number of classrooms, Johnston said. The gunman shot out windows and through walls, and broken glass led to some injuries, the school district said. The student who sustained a gunshot wound is in stable condition.\n\nIt appears that the gunman became frustrated when he could not gain entry inside the classrooms, so he re-entered his vehicle and continued the shooting spree in the streets.\n\nThe incident could have been much worse had it not been for the quick thinking of staff at the elementary school, Johnston said. The school district commended the school's staff for their 'courageous and professional response' to the 'terrible incident.'\n\n'The school was able to go on lockdown very quickly and effectively, which prevented any further injury or violence,' the school district said.\n\nPolice have obtained surveillance video from the school but have not yet made the footage available to the public, Johnston said.\n\nThe male suspect was killed by police, but his motive is unknown, according to authorities. He has been positively identified, but Johnston declined to release his name at this point in the investigation.\n\nThere was an ongoing dispute between the gunman and a woman who was killed in the shooting spree, Johnston said. Authorities also said they were aware of a neighborhood dispute the suspect was involved in.\n\nCoy Ferreira told ABC Redding, California affiliate KRCR he was dropping his daughter off for kindergarten when he heard what sounded like a firecracker. A school employee ran out and yelled for the children to get inside, Ferreira said. That’s when he ran into a classroom and multiple shots came through the classroom windows, hitting a student, he said.\n\nPolice said the motive is unknown but added that the gunman appeared to directly target the Rancho Tehama School and shot into the school multiple times, according to police.\n\nAuthorities said the shooting started just before 8 a.m. with random shots fired into residences. The suspect then engaged a citizen who followed him before stealing the citizen's car and opening fire through the community, police said.\n\nThe gunman 'arbitrarily' shot at residents in the rural area as he drove by, Johnston said.\n\nShortly after, the gunman engaged with a woman who was taking her two children to school and allegedly opened fire on them at an intersection, authorities said. The mother suffered severe and life-threatening injuries from the shooting, and one of her children sustained non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\n\nThe gunman then turned his sights to the elementary school, where he spent about six minutes, Johnston said. After he left the school, he went back on the road and shot and killed one person, Johnston said.\n\nAfter that, the suspect allegedly crashed the stolen car, robbed someone and took a second vehicle, authorities said.\n\nKHSL\n\nJim Schultz/Record Searchlight via USA TODAY Network\n\nThe suspect, who was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns, engaged two officers and they returned fire, killing the suspect at the scene, according to police. Another weapon was found in the crashed vehicle, but it had not yet been recovered, Johnston said.\n\nAuthorities said they are aware of a domestic violence incident involving the suspect, adding that he had prior contact with law enforcement and apparently had a history of neighborhood disputes.\n\nThe suspect had been issued a restraining order in January, Johnston said, but the circumstances surrounding the order are unclear.\n\nAbout 100 students attend Rancho Tehama School, which was placed on lockdown following the incident, according to Ann Bates, administrative assistant to the superintendent of the Corning Union Elementary School District.\n\nAll students have been accounted for, and the children have since been reunited with their families, officials said.\n\nABC News' Marilyn Heck contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/shooting-reported-northern-california-elementary-school/story?id=51143319","None"
"Ex-cop Michael Slager sentenced to 20 years for shooting death of Walter Scott\nFormer South Carolina police officer Michael Slager was sentenced today to 20 years in prison for the deadly shooting of unarmed black man Walter Scott.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Norton ruled that Slager committed second-degree murder and obstruction of justice, when he shot and killed 50-year-old Scott in 2015. The second-degree murder ruling came with a recommended 19 to 24 year sentence.\n\nAt one point during the sentencing Scott's mother looked the former officer in the eye and told him she forgave him. Families on both sides of the court burst into tears.\n\nOne of Walter Scott's brothers, Rodney Scott, told the court that the death of his brother the worst day of his life. Rodney Scott said he wants Slager to pay for his actions.\n\nAcquired by ABC News\n\nSlager’s father, mother, sister and wife also spoke to the judge, begging for a lighter sentence. They talked about how Slager led a life of service and how upset they were after the shooting. Michael Slager's wife, Jamie Slager, told the judge, “He had to make a decision in a split second. I couldn’t imagine having to make a decision that fast.”\n\nThe judge's decision comes after Michael Slager, who is white, pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights offense.\n\nMichael Slager shot and killed Walter Scott on April 4, 2015, while Slager was an officer with the North Charleston Police Department. Michael Slager claimed self-defense, but witness cellphone video that surfaced shortly after the encounter showed the officer fatally shooting Walter Scott in the back as he ran away. He was fired from the force after the shooting.\n\nHandout from family\n\nMichael Slager was charged in South Carolina with murder and pleaded not guilty. During the state murder trial, Michael Slager's attorney said his client shot Walter Scott because he was in fear for his life. In 2016, the case ended in a mistrial. The state retrial and federal trial were expected to take place this year, but instead, in May Michael Slager pleaded guilty to violating Walter Scott's civil rights in federal court, ending the federal case against him and also resolving the state charges that were pending after the mistrial.\n\nBefore hearing his sentence in federal court, Michael Slager called each family member out by name and apologized, thanking them for forgiving him. “I wish this never would have happened,' he said. “I wish I could go back to the day and change the events, but I can’t.”\n\nAt a news conference after the sentencing, Rodney Scott said his family is 'pleased.'\n\n'We got justice,' he said.\n\nRandall Hill/Reuters\n\nHe said his family is 'thankful for the justice system that worked on our behalf,' but added that 'a lot of work' still needs to be done in the justice system.\n\nAnother one of Walter Scott's brothers, Anthony Scott, thanked Feiden Santana, the witness who filmed the shooting, for being 'brave' enough to film what he saw.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/cop-michael-slager-faces-19-24-years-prison/story?id=51595376","None"
"Drug-Shooting 'Bazooka' Seized In Mexico As Smugglers Aim Skyward\nDrug-Shooting 'Bazooka' Seized In Mexico As Smugglers Aim Skyward\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brennan Linsley/AP Brennan Linsley/AP\n\nAs Mexican authorities continue to crack down on drug smugglers, criminals continue to aim high in a bid to evade them. Last week, Mexican authorities seized a jury-rigged bazooka and nearly one ton of marijuana in the border town of Agua Prieta in Sonora state, the Mexican Attorney General said in a statement.\n\nThe bazooka had been 'adapted' to use a compressor for launching drugs into the United States. The Mexican daily El Universal reports the device was inside a van with a sliding roof, allowing the bazooka to shoot the drugs from the cover of the vehicle.\n\nAgua Prieta lies directly across the border from Douglas, Ariz. Last year, Mexican federal authorities found yet another 'homemade bazooka' in the town, this one measuring nearly 10 feet long, alongside an air compressor inside a modified panel van with no license plate. Officials say it was apparently used for launching projectiles, possibly drugs, across the border.\n\nABC News video of homemade bazooka seized in 2016. YouTube\n\nSmugglers have been trying to hurl drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border for years.\n\nIn 2011, as The Two-Way has reported, 'smugglers tried using a catapult to get pot into the U.S.' The following year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents found nearly three dozen canisters filled with 85 pounds of marijuana near Yuma, Ariz. and after smugglers in Mexico used a pneumatic-powered cannon to shoot the drugs 500 feet across the border.\n\nNeed a better visual of how they work? Wired likened the devices to the air cannons used in 'punkin' chunkin'' contests.\n\nEach year, Mexican-based transnational criminal organizations bring in drugs by the 'multi-ton' over the Southwest U.S. border, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. The most common smuggling method is simply to hide the drugs in vehicles, the DEA says, but, boats, tunnels and drones are also employed.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says the number of Border Patrol agents trying to stop the smugglers by land, sea and increasingly air, has nearly doubled since 2004, now totaling nearly 20,000.\n\nIn February, Paul Beeson, who heads a joint task force of DHS's southern border campaign, testified to Congress that smugglers 'previously threw, by hand, small loads of drugs over the border fence, they now utilize compressed air cannons to launch bundles of illicit narcotics in excess of 100 pounds over the border fence.'\n\nBeeson said these operations are 'indicative of the ever-evolving and persistent intent of TCOs to exploit the border environment.'\n\nNPR correspondent Carrie Kahn contributed to this report.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/14/564050813/drug-shooting-bazooka-seized-in-mexico-as-smugglers-aim-skyward","1510635600.0"

"Top general says he would resist 'illegal' nuke order from Trump\nThe top U.S. nuclear commander said Saturday he would push back against President Trump if he ordered a nuclear launch the general believed to be 'illegal,' saying he would look to find another solution.\n\nAir Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Saturday that he has given a lot of thought to what he would say if a president ordered a strike he considered unlawful.\n\n'I think some people think we're stupid,' Hyten said in response to a question about such a scenario. 'We're not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?'\n\nThe Halifax International Security Forum\n\nHyten was responding to a question about testimony by former STRATCOM commander retired Gen. Robert Kehler before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this week. Kehler said that nuclear operators would refuse to implement an unlawful order. Hyten agreed, and argued that the process in place to launch a nuclear strike would prevent such a situation from arising in the first place. As head of STRATCOM, Hyten is responsible for overseeing the U.S. nuclear arsenal.\n\n'I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,' Hyten added. 'And if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say, 'Mr. President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options, with a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works. It's not that complicated.'\n\nHyten said he has been trained every year for decades in the law of armed conflict, which takes into account specific factors to determine legality -- necessity, distinction, proportionality, unnecessary suffering and more. Running through scenarios of how to react in the event of an illegal order is standard practice, he said.\n\n'If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life,' Hyten said.\n\nHyten's comments come against the backdrop of continued tension with North Korea. In the past, the president has pledged to unleash 'fire and fury' and to 'totally destroy' North Korea if necessary. Hyten's comments also come as Congress is re-examining the authorization of the use of military force and power to launch a nuclear strike.\n\nHyten said the U.S. military is always ready to respond to the threat of North Korea, even at that very moment.\n\n'And we are ready every minute of every day to respond to any event that comes out of North Korea. That's the element of deterrence that has to be clear, and it is clear,' Hyten said.\n\nBut Hyten also said handling North Korea and its unpredictable leader Kim Jong Un has to be an international effort. Mr. Trump has continued to put pressure on China to help manage its tempestuous neighbor.\n\n'President Trump by himself can't change the behavior of Kim Jong Un,' Hyten said. 'But President Trump can create the conditions that the international community can reach out in different ways where we can work with the Republic of Korea, where we can work with our neighbors in the region.'\n\nCBS News' Stefan Becket contributed to this report.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-strategic-command-gen-john-hyten-resist-illegal-nuke-order-from-trump/","None"
"Tillerson: China agrees on 'action' on North Korea as navy strike group sails\nAs the US navy deployed a strike group towards the western Pacific Ocean, to provide a presence near the Korean peninsula, the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said China agreed with the Trump administration that “action has to be taken” regarding North Korea.\n\nTrump officials broadcast president's plan for Syria: wait for global response Read more\n\nTillerson told CBS’s Face the Nation, in an interview broadcast on Sunday, that when Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping met at the Mar-a-Lago resort this week, they “had extensive discussions around the dangerous situation in North Korea”.\n\n“President Xi clearly understands, and I think agrees, that the situation has intensified and has reached a certain level of threat that action has to be taken,” Tillerson said.\n\n\n\nTillerson described a “shared view and no disagreement as to how dangerous the situation has become”.\n\nIn view of the regional threat now posed by North Korean missile tests and nuclear ambitions, he said, the Chinese “do not believe the conditions are right today to engage in discussions with the government in Pyongyang”.\n\n“We’re hopeful,” he added, “that we can work together with the Chinese to change the conditions in the minds of the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] leadership. And then, at that point, perhaps discussions may be useful.\n\n“But I think there’s a shared view and no disagreement as to how dangerous the situation has become. And I think even China is beginning to recognise that this presents a threat to even to China’s interests as well.”\n\nThe Carl Vinson strike group, which includes an aircraft carrier, was first scheduled to make port calls in Australia but was redirected from Singapore to the western Pacific.\n\n\n\n“US Pacific Command ordered the Carl Vinson strike group north as a prudent measure to maintain readiness and presence in the western Pacific,” said Commander Dave Benham, spokesman at US Pacific Command.\n\n\n\n“The No 1 threat in the region continues to be North Korea, due to its reckless, irresponsible and destabilising programme of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability,” he said, in an unusually forceful statement.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump’s national security adviser HR McMaster told Fox News Sunday the strike group had been moved because “it is prudent to do it”.\n\nThe news followed a Friday report by NBC that the National Security Council had included the return of nuclear weapons to South Korea in options presented to Trump for dealing with North Korea. Killing North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, was also presented as an option, NBC reported.\n\nDiscussing that report on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey, a Democratic member of the Senate’s foreign relations committee, said such moves would cause “an escalation of tension that could lead to nuclear war”. The US, Markey said, should work with China to establish direct talks with Kim, as the best way to tackle “this boiling, bubbling cauldron”.\n\nOn Saturday the White House said Trump had spoken to the acting president of South Korea, Hwang Kyo-ahn. North Korea, meanwhile, called the US missile strike on Syria on Thursday night “an intolerable act of aggression”.\n\nAnalysts have said the Syria strike, launched after the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, contained a clear message for Pyongyang that the US is not afraid to exercise the military option. Appearing on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, Tillerson strongly suggested as much, saying of Syria: “If you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken.”\n\nTrump has recently threatened unilateral action against Pyongyang if Beijing fails to help curb its neighbour’s nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang’s response on Saturday suggested it was determined to continue.\n\n“Swaggering as a superpower, the US has been picking only on countries without nuclear weapons and the Trump administration is no exception,” a foreign ministry spokesman said, according to the KCNA news agency.\n\nThe comments were Pyongyang’s first since Trump ordered the strikes on Syria.\n\n\n\n“The US missile attack against Syria is a clear and intolerable act of aggression against a sovereign state and we strongly condemn it,” KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying.\n\nUS says it has 'spoken enough about North Korea' after new missile launch Read more\n\n“The reality of today shows that we must stand against power with power and it proves a million times over that our decision to strengthen our nuclear deterrence has been the right choice.\n\n“The Syria attack thoroughly reminds us the fact that it is absolutely dangerous to have any illusions about imperialism and only military power of our own will protect us from imperialistic aggression.\n\n“We will keep bolstering our self-defensive military might in various ways in order to cope with the ever-intensifying US acts of aggression.”\n\nThe North has carried out five nuclear tests – two last year – and expert satellite imagery analysis suggests it could well be preparing for a sixth. Pyongyang has shown no sign of reining in a missile testing programme ultimately aimed at securing the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the continental US.\n\nAsked on ABC if North Korean development of an intercontinental missile would be a “red line” for Trump, Tillerson said: “If we judge that they have perfected that type of delivery system, then that becomes a very serious stage of their further development.”\n\nHe added: “With no further testing, their programme does not progress and that’s what we’ve asked for before we can begin to have further talks with them.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/09/us-navy-strike-group-north-korea-peninsula-syria-missile-strike","1491710400.0"

"California to list herbicide as cancer-causing; Monsanto vows fight\n(Reuters) - Glyphosate, an herbicide and the active ingredient in Monsanto Co’s popular Roundup weed killer, will be added to California’s list of chemicals known to cause cancer effective July 7, the state’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) said on Monday.\n\nMonsanto vowed to continue its legal fight against the designation, required under a state law known as Proposition 65, and called the decision “unwarranted on the basis of science and the law.”\n\nThe listing is the latest legal setback for the seeds and chemicals company, which has faced increasing litigation over glyphosate since the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer said that it is “probably carcinogenic” in a controversial ruling in 2015.\n\nEarlier this month, Reuters reported that the scientist leading the IARC’s review knew of fresh data showing no link between glyphosate and cancer. But he never mentioned it, and the agency did not take the information into account because it had yet to be published in a scientific journal. The IARC classed glyphosate as a “probable carcinogen,” the only major health regulator to do so.\n\nDicamba, a weed killer designed for use with Monsanto’s next generation of biotech crops, is under scrutiny in Arkansas after the state’s plant board voted last week to ban the chemical.\n\nOEHHA said the designation of glyphosate under Proposition 65 will proceed following an unsuccessful attempt by Monsanto to block the listing in trial court and after requests for stay were denied by a state appellate court and the California’s Supreme Court.\n\nMonsanto’s appeal of the trial court’s ruling is pending.\n\nMonsanto Co's Roundup is shown for sale in Encinitas, California, U.S., June 26, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\n“This is not the final step in the process, and it has no bearing on the merits of the case. We will continue to aggressively challenge this improper decision,” Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s vice president of global strategy, said.\n\nListing glyphosate as a known carcinogen under California’s Proposition 65 would require companies selling the chemical in the state to add warning labels to packaging. Warnings would also be required if glyphosate is being sprayed at levels deemed unsafe by regulators.\n\nUsers of the chemical include landscapers, golf courses, orchards, vineyards and farms.\n\nMonsanto and other glyphosate producers would have roughly a year from the listing date to re-label products or remove them from store shelves if further legal challenges are lost.\n\nMonsanto has not calculated the cost of any re-labeling effort and does not break out glyphosate sales data by state, Partridge said.\n\nEnvironmental groups cheered OEHHA’s move to list the chemical.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\n“California’s decision makes it the national leader in protecting people from cancer-causing pesticides,” said Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-glyphosate-california-idUSKBN19H2K1","1498590159.0"

Now it's flirting with another milestone: a $10,000 price for a single unit of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's rise has been both meteoric and volatile, with surges in valuation often being driven by positive reports about its status.

"After Massive Data Breach, Equifax Directed Customers To Fake Site\nAfter Massive Data Breach, Equifax Directed Customers To Fake Site\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mike Stewart/AP Mike Stewart/AP\n\nAfter a cyberattack that potentially exposed the personal information of 143 million people, the credit reporting agency Equifax set up www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, a website to help people determine whether they had been affected.\n\nHowever, on multiple occasions over the span of weeks, the company's official Twitter account responded to customer inquiries by apparently directing them to a fake phishing site called www.securityequifax2017.com.\n\nLuckily, the fake site — blocked or flagged by many Internet browsers, then taken down Wednesday afternoon — was set up by software engineer Nick Sweeting to educate people rather than steal their information. A banner on the top read: 'Cybersecurity Incident & Important Consumer Information Which Is Totally Fake, Why Did Equifax Use A Domain That's So Easily Impersonated By Phishing Sites?'\n\nStill, it's an embarrassing development for the company that is struggling to regain public trust, especially considering that customers may have been directed to the fake site at precisely the moment they were seeking reassurance about the safety of their data.\n\nThe personal information leaked earlier this month included names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses and, in some cases, driver's license numbers and credit card information.\n\nIt's not clear exactly how many times Equifax tweeted the fake site. Sweeting posted a screenshot that appears to show three different tweets, dating to Sept. 9.\n\n'All posts using the wrong link have been taken down. We apologize for the confusion,' an Equifax spokesperson told NPR, adding:\n\n'Consumers should be aware of fake websites purporting to be operated by Equifax. Our dedicated website for consumers to learn more about the incident and sign up for free credit monitoring is https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/, and our company homepage is equifax.com. Please be cautious of visiting other websites claiming to be operated by Equifax that do not originate from these two pages.'\n\nEquifax is facing criticism because after the security incident it chose to create an entirely new domain for customers to check whether they were affected — www.equifaxsecurity2017.com — rather than keep the response page within its own primary domain, equifax.com.\n\nThat makes it more difficult for customers to determine whether it is a real Equifax site, even as they are being asked to provide their last name and a portion of their Social Security number to check the safety of their personal information. Equifax did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment about its choice of domain.\n\n'I recommend companies direct people to a site that is trusted and part of their main domain, in order to make sure that something like this doesn't happen,' Tarah Wheeler, a cybersecurity consultant at Red Queen Technologies, told NPR. 'I'm grateful that the domain was registered by someone who was doing educational work and pointing out a problem like this, and not someone who's malicious.'\n\nThat's because she has seen multiple sites that are close in name to www.equifaxsecurity2017.com but are actually phishing scams. These schemes are '100 percent anticipated,' Wheeler says, and a reason many large companies buy up domains that are common misspellings of their domain.\n\n'It's in everyone's interest to get Equifax to change this site to a reputable domain,' Sweeting, a software engineer based in Medellín, Colombia, told NPR in a written statement. He called the site 'dangerously easy to impersonate,' adding that it 'only took me 20 minutes to build my clone.'\n\n'The 'wget' command on linux allows you to download a website, including all images, html, css, etc. Using this command, it was very easy to just suck their whole site down and throw it on a $5 server. It currently has the same type of SSL certificate as the real version, so from a trust perspective, there's no way for users to authenticate the real one vs my server. They should either change it to https://equifax.com (with an EV cert), or take it down altogether. 'I hope other companies are able to learn from this mistake, and remember to publish content only on trusted domains. ... I just hope the employee who posted the tweet doesn't get fired, they probably just Google'd for the URL and ended up finding the fake one instead. The real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly.'\n\nWheeler stresses that responding to a security incident like this is 'extraordinarily difficult.'\n\n'The level of anger and hatred being directed at Equifax doesn't take into account how difficult good cybersecurity incident response is to pull off,' she says, adding that it's crucial for companies to rehearse their response in advance. Equifax's response to this breach, she says, 'showed I think very clearly that the kind of preparation that goes into good incident response hadn't been done in advance.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/21/552681357/after-massive-data-breach-equifax-directed-customers-to-fake-site","1505966400.0"
"In call with Trump, China's Xi urges restraint over North Korea\nBEDMINSTER, N.J./BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s President Xi Jinping said there needs to be a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue, and in a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump he urged all sides to avoid words or action that raise tensions.\n\nXi’s comments came hours after Trump warned North Korea that the U.S. military was “locked and loaded” as Pyongyang accused the U.S. leader of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nThe Pentagon said the United States and South Korea would proceed as planned with a joint military exercise in 10 days, an action sure to further antagonize North Korea.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry said in a statement that Xi told Trump a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue was essential, and urged calm.\n\n“Concerned parties must exercise restraint and avoid remarks and actions that escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula,” it cited Xi as saying.\n\nIn their phone call, Trump and Xi “agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior,” the White House said in a statement, and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. It added the relationship between Trump and Xi was “extremely close” and “will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem.”\n\nTrump, vacationing at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf resort, earlier took to Twitter to warn North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that U.S. “military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely”.\n\nAgain referring to Kim, Trump added, “If he utters one threat ... or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that’s an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast.”\n\nIn remarks to reporters on Friday after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Trump said the situation with North Korea was “very dangerous and it will not continue”.\n\nHe added, “We will see what happens. We think that lots of good things could happen, and we could also have a bad solution.”\n\nDespite the tough rhetoric, Trump insisted that “nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump.”\n\nSouth Korea’s presidential Blue House said in a statement on Saturday the United States and China were working to resolve the North Korea crisis, and it hoped the two leaders’ phone call “will be able to resolve the peak of tension and act as a catalyst for the situation to move on to a new dimension.”\n\nTRUMP TO GUAM: “YOU’RE SAFE”\n\nGuam, the Pacific island that is a U.S. territory and home to a U.S. air base, a Navy installation, a Coast Guard group and around 6,000 U.S. military personnel, posted emergency guidelines on Friday to help residents prepare for any potential nuclear attack.\n\nNorth Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday the North Korean army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land in the sea 18 to 25 miles (30 to 40 km) from Guam.\n\nJapan’s government decided to deploy its Patriot missile defense system to four locations in the west of the country, media reported. No one at Japan’s defense ministry was available to comment on Saturday.\n\nThe governor of Guam, Eddie Baza Calvo, posted a video on Facebook of himself speaking with Trump. “We are with you a thousand percent. You are safe,” Trump told Calvo.\n\nWashington wants to stop Pyongyang from developing nuclear missiles that could hit the United States. North Korea sees its nuclear arsenal as protection against the United States and its partners in Asia.\n\nTrump said he was considering additional sanctions on North Korea, adding these would be “very strong.” He gave no details and did not make clear whether he meant unilateral or multilateral sanctions.\n\nU.S. officials have said new U.S. steps targeting Chinese banks and firms doing business with Pyongyang are in the works, but these have appeared to be put on hold to give Beijing time to show it is serious about enforcing new U.N. sanctions.\n\nFILE PHOTO - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017. REUTERS/Saul Loeb, Pool\n\nBACK CHANNELS\n\nTrump said he did not want to talk about diplomatic “back channels” with North Korea after U.S. media reports that Joseph Yun, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy, had engaged in diplomacy for several months with Pak Song Il, a senior diplomat at Pyongyang’s U.N. mission, on the deteriorating ties and the issue of Americans imprisoned in North Korea.\n\nBut Daniel Russel, until April the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, said this so-called New York channel had been a relatively commonplace means of communication with North Korea over the years, and was not a forum for negotiation.\n\n“It’s never been a vehicle for negotiations and this doesn’t constitute substantive U.S.-DPRK dialogue,” he said, using the acronym for North Korea’s formal name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nBoth Moscow and Berlin expressed alarm over the rise in rhetoric over North Korea, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged Pyongyang and Washington to sign up to a joint Russian-Chinese plan by which North Korea would freeze missile tests and the United States and South Korea would impose a moratorium on large-scale military exercises. Neither the United States nor North Korea has embraced the plan.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said there is no military solution, adding that “an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer.”\n\nThe French presidency said North Korea was engaged in a “dangerous escalation” of tensions.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron “calls for all parties to act responsibly and prevent any further escalation in tensions,” the Elysee palace said in a statement.\n\nTrump and Macron spoke on Saturday. The White House said Trump reiterated the U.S. commitment to stop the “North Korean nuclear menace” and said Washington was ready with diplomatic, economic and military measures.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said blame for problems lay with North Korea, and that the international community was “shoulder to shoulder” in efforts to stop North Korean aggression.\n\n“We are working with the US and our partners in the region to bring this crisis to a diplomatic end,” he tweeted.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nAs the rhetoric has ratcheted up, South Koreans are buying more ready-to-eat meals for emergency use, and the government aims to expand nationwide civil defense drills planned for Aug. 23. Hundreds of thousands of troops and huge arsenals are arrayed on both sides of the tense demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-china-idUSKBN1AO011","1502561042.0"
"Mogadishu Truck Bombings Are Deadliest Attack in Decades\nAs the death toll grew Sunday, the Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared three days of national mourning. He donated blood for the victims and asked his fellow citizens to do the same.\n\n“Today’s horrific attack proves our enemy would stop nothing to cause our people pain and suffering. Let’s unite against terror,” Mr. Mohamed said on Twitter. “Time to unite and pray together. Terror won’t win.”\n\nOn Sunday, fires were still burning at the scene of the bombings. Senator Ahmed, deputy speaker of the upper house of Parliament, wrote on his Facebook page that the director of one hospital had told him at least 130 bodies there were burned beyond recognition.\n\nWitnesses said the attack was made even worse by the number of cars stuck on the road where one of the bombs exploded.\n\n“There was a traffic jam, and the road was packed with bystanders and cars,” a waiter at a nearby restaurant said. “It’s a disaster.”\n\nDoctors at hospitals in Mogadishu struggled to save the wounded on Sunday. The Associated Press quoted one nurse as saying staff members had seen “unspeakable horrors” in a hospital where the smell of blood was strong. The news agency reported that exhausted doctors fought to keep their eyes open even as the screams of victims echoed through the halls.\n\nHopes for Somalia tend to ebb and flow after more than 25 years of chaos since its central government collapsed. In recent years, there has been a bit more optimism with a new government in power. Still, in the fragile world of Somali politics, the threat of the Shabab never went away. Hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in attacks on the capital this year alone.\n\nAnalysts thought the latest attack might have been in retaliation both for the loss of territory and for increasing American drone attacks since Mr. Trump loosened restrictions meant to strictly limit civilian casualties.\n\nUnited States Special Operations forces have launched 15 airstrikes against Shabab leaders, fighters and training camps since the beginning of the year, including five strikes last month, according to The Long War Journal, which tracks American strikes against militants in Africa.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After he was killed, the Pentagon’s Africa Command said his removal from the battlefield would significantly degrade the Shabab’s ability to coordinate attacks in the capital and in southern Somalia.\n\nCounterterrorism specialists said the size of the bombings Saturday, which were well beyond what the Shabab have conducted before, suggested that the group might have received help from operatives with the Qaeda arm in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is renowned for its prowess with explosives.\n\nAfrica specialists said the attack could backfire on the Shabab — and that may be one reason the group has not claimed responsibility, at least so far.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/world/africa/somalia-bombing-mogadishu.html","1508040000.0"
"North Korea Holds Drill With Live Fire to Mark Military Anniversary: Seoul\nNorth Korean General Warns of Pre-emptive Strike\n\nCrowds in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, laid flowers and paid respects at giant statues of the country's former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, one day after the minister of defense reiterated that the North is ready to use pre-emptive strikes or any measures it deems necessary to defend itself against the 'U.S. imperialists.'\n\n'The situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a nuclear war may break out due to the frantic war drills of the U.S. imperialists and their vassal forces for aggression,' Gen. Pak Yong Sik told a 'national meeting' of thousands of senior military and civilian officials.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it is closely watching North Korean military action in the Wonsan city area, where it said the drills were being held. South Korea's Yonhap news agency earlier said that the exercise involved 300 to 400 artillery pieces, but an official from Seoul's Defense Ministry couldn't confirm such details.\n\nThe streets of Pyongyang were quiet. Flower-laying and bowing at statues and portraits of the leaders is a regular routine on major anniversaries. People also gathered in open spaces to take part in organized dancing, another common way to mark holidays.\n\nRelated: American Tony Kim’s Ex Co-Workers ‘Surprised’ at His Detention in North Korea\n\n'Our great leaders founded and wisely led our revolutionary army, and just like that, now our respected Marshal Kim Jong Un is leading wisely, so even though the situation is tense, we are celebrating the day,' said Choe Un Byol, who had come with his family to the bronze statues of the former leaders.\n\nNorth Korea often also marks significant dates by displaying its military capability. Pyongyang launched a missile one day after the 105th birthday of late founder Kim Il Sung on April 15.\n\nRecent U.S. commercial satellite images indicate increased activity around North Korea's nuclear test site, and third-generation dictator Kim has said the country's preparation for an ICBM launch is in its 'final stage.'\n\nU.S. Navy Gathers Off Koreas\n\nThe USS Michigan, a nuclear-powered submarine, arrived at the South Korean port of Busan in what was described as a routine visit to rest the crew and load supplies. Cmdr. Jang Wook from South Korean navy public affairs said there was no plan for a drill.\n\nThe submarine's arrival comes as the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier heads toward the Korean Peninsula for a joint exercise with South Korea around the weekend.\n\nRelated: VP Pence on North Korea: All Option Are On The Table\n\nDespite the buildup, President Donald Trump has reportedly settled on a strategy that emphasizes increased pressure on North Korea with the help of China, the North's only major ally, instead of military options or trying to overthrow North Korea's government.\n\nWashington's Words\n\nTrump told ambassadors from U.N. Security Council member countries that they must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on North Korea.\n\n'This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,' Trump said at a White House meeting Monday.

"Earthquake Off Mexico Kills Dozens, Sparks Tsunami Warning\nThis quake, which prompted warnings of possible tsunami waves up to 10 feet high, was stronger than the 1985 tremor that killed more than 5,000 people in Mexico's capital, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto said.\n\nBut with an epicenter 40 miles off the country's coast, the first reports were that Mexico City had largely been spared.\n\nIt was a different story in Oaxaca, where Gov. Alejandro Murat reported at least 45 fatalities. More deaths were reported in the Chiapas and Tabasco states, including three children, according to officials.\n\nOne child in Tabasco was killed by a collapsing wall, the state's Gov. Arturo Nunez said. Also, a baby at a hospital died when the building lost power.\n\nThe Mexican president said there had been at least 62 aftershocks and warned his countrymen to brace themselves for one that could hit 7.2 on the Richer scale could hit in the next 24 hours.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the quake, more than homes and businesses lost power, Peña Nieto said. Within hours, electricity had been restored to 800,000 of them.\n\nIn Chiapas, the state closest to the offshore epicenter, there were reports some buildings had been badly damaged. Its governor, Manuel Velasco Coello, said on Facebook that around 1,000 army troops were helping with the rescue and recovery effort.\n\nSeveral towns that were in danger of being hit by the tsunami waves were evacuated, Coello said.\n\nU.S. Geological Survey\n\nIn Mexico City, survivors described how they were shaken awake by the quake.\n\n'I felt the shaking and knew it was an earthquake,' said Mark Van Eps, a 39-year-old musician from Los Angeles who was vacationing in Mexico City.

"North Korea 'ready for war' after US redeploys navy strike team\nPyongyang cites ‘reckless moves’ by US as Donald Trump repeats threat of unilateral action if China does not put pressure on its neighbour\n\nNorth Korea has warned of “catastrophic consequences” in response to any further provocations by the US, days after a US navy battle group was sent to waters off the Korean peninsula, and was met by Donald Trump with a repeated threat of unspecified unilateral action.\n\nThe US president said on Twitter that he would “solve the problem” of North Korea if China did not provide greater help in exerting pressure on its neighbour.\n\n\n\nThe shrill rhetoric has been matched by a military build-up.\n\nThe decision to divert the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and other battleships from a planned visit to Australia to the western Pacific came after tensions increased over ongoing military drills involving American and South Korean forces that Pyongyang regards as a dress rehearsal for an invasion.\n\n\n\nTillerson: China agrees on 'action' on North Korea as navy strike group sails Read more\n\n“We will hold the US wholly accountable for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its outrageous actions,” North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying. “(North Korea) is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the US.”\n\nThe spokesman cited Washington’s refusal to rule out a pre-emptive strike against North Korean missile sites as justification for its nuclear programme.\n\n“The prevailing grave situation proves once again that (North Korea) was entirely just when it increased in every way its military capabilities for self-defence and pre-emptive attack with a nuclear force as a pivot,” the spokesman said, according to KCNA.\n\n“We will take the toughest counteraction against the provocateurs in order to defend ourselves by powerful force of arms.”\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump took to Twitter to deliver his latest threat aimed at the Pyongyang regime.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.\n\nThe tweet came in the wake of a summit meeting with Xi Jinping in Florida at the end of last week, when the Trump administration tried to persuade the Chinese president to enforce existing sanctions on North Korea more rigorously. There is no evidence that plea succeeded.\n\nHowever, the threat of unilateral action is weakened by the acceptance by most of the US national security establishment that any preventative strike aimed at North Korean missile and nuclear facilities could trigger devastating reprisals against South Korea, Seoul in particular, and US bases in the region.\n\nLast week’s US strike against a Syrian base is also being seen as a warning to North Korea, after Donald Trump said Washington was prepared to act alone if China failed to exert more pressure on its neighbour to halt its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.\n\nNorth Korea again defied UN resolutions banning it from developing ballistic missile technology with another test-launch on the eve of Trump’s summit with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, in Florida last week.\n\nWhite House officials have signalled that all options – including pre-emptive strikes – remain on the table in addressing North Korea’s steady advance towards developing long-range missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead as far as the US mainland.\n\nThe nuclear-powered Carl Vinson’s presence in the area coincides with speculation that North Korea could be preparing to conduct its sixth nuclear test to coincide with key dates in the country’s history, including the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder, Kim Il-sung, on Saturday.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry, meanwhile, has played down reports that Beijing has deployed 150,000 troops to its border with North Korea.\n\nHua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told reporters she was “not aware” of such a mobilisation by the People’s Liberation Army along the 880-mile border. In the past, similar reports had been proven “groundless and false,” Hua claimed.\n\nHowever, with regional tensions building ahead of Saturday’s Kim Il-sung commemorations, Hua said China was “closely following” developments on the Korean peninsula.\n\n“We believe that, given the current situation, all relevant parties should exercise restraint and avoid activities that may escalate the tension.”\n\n\n\n\n\n","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/11/north-korea-ready-for-war-us-navy-redeploys","1491883200.0"

"Trump Orders Largest National Monument Reduction In U.S. History\nTrump Orders Largest National Monument Reduction In U.S. History\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR Howard Berkes/NPR\n\nUpdated at 9:30 p.m. ET\n\nOn a visit to Utah on Monday, President Trump announced his proclamations dramatically shrinking the size of the state's two massive national monuments, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. Taken together, Trump's orders mark the largest reversal of national monument protections in U.S. history.\n\nThe change has already been challenged in court by conservation groups.\n\nThe Bears Ears National Monument will go from roughly 1.3 million acres to roughly 228,000 — only about 15 percent of its original size. And Grand Staircase will be diminished by roughly half, from its nearly 1.9 million acres to about 1 million. The specific numbers were provided to reporters by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke prior to Trump's announcement in Salt Lake City.\n\n'No one values the splendor of Utah more than you do,' Trump told an enthusiastic crowd Monday, 'and no one knows better how to use it.'\n\nHe noted that before making the decision, he had discussed it with Zinke and the state's two GOP senators, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee. Both senators have been outspoken critics of the two national monuments — both protected under the 1906 Antiquities Act by Democratic presidents — framing them as significant federal overreach that deprives Utahans of their own land.\n\nAnd Trump echoed those criticisms Monday.\n\n'These abuses of the Antiquities Act give enormous power to faraway bureaucrats at the expense of the people who actually live here, work here and make this place their home,' Trump said.\n\nHis decision caps months of speculation and a controversial review of the boundaries of large national monuments that protect more than 100,000 acres of U.S. public land. The review, conducted by Zinke, originally looked at more than two dozen national monuments designated by presidential decree since the 1990s.\n\nUtah, with its new Bears Ears monument and the Grand Staircase National Monument, has always been at the center of the debate and largely what spurred the review. Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama, created Bears Ears shortly before leaving office, while the Grand Staircase monument dates to the Clinton administration.\n\nAnd depending on which side you're on, Monday's announcement is either about an overreaching federal government that prevented development on large amounts of federal land with little local support or it's the latest example of the U.S. government breaking promises with Native Americans and eroding environmental protections.\n\nThe case to reduce the monuments\n\nUtah's Republican congressional delegation, along with county commissions and conservative groups, pressed the administration to open up these federal lands once more for private use.\n\n'President Trump's decision to reduce these monuments allows us to still protect those areas that need protection, while at the same time keeping the area open and accessible to locals who depend on this land for their daily lives,' said Matt Anderson of the Utah-based Sutherland Institute.\n\nAnderson says large, public-land national monuments hurt rural counties. These areas already have large amounts of federal public land, he says, where cattle grazing, mining and other types of private enterprise are heavily regulated.\n\nRural Utah is still fuming from President Bill Clinton's designation of the Grand Staircase in 1996, which grandfathered in existing cattle-grazing leases and other uses but also nixed a proposed coal mine. Clinton signed the proclamation at the Grand Canyon, in Arizona, and Utah officials at the time said they were blindsided.\n\n'When you designate a large national monument, you restrict access to the land and you block traditional uses of the land,' Anderson said.\n\nThe home of Bears Ears, rural San Juan County, is often cited as one of Utah's poorest, and more than 60 percent of all its land is owned and managed by the federal government.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption George Frey/Getty Images George Frey/Getty Images\n\n'A sad day for Indigenous people and for America'\n\nDuring his speech Monday, Trump said the national monument designations also 'prevent Native Americans from having their rightful voice over the sacred land where they practice their most important ancestral and religious traditions.'\n\nMany tribal leaders and activists are likely to deeply object to this assessment. For months, they have passionately campaigned to preserve the national monument designations — and now, upon hearing Trump's proclamations, they are promising to sue.\n\n'The Navajo Nation has made repeated requests to meet with President Trump on this issue. The Bears Ears Monument is of critical importance, not only to the Navajo Nation but to many tribes in the region,' Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye said in a written statement.\n\n'The decision to reduce the size of the Monument is being made with no tribal consultation,' he said. 'The Navajo Nation will defend Bears Ears. The reduction in the size of the Monument leaves us no choice but to litigate this decision.'\n\n'Bears Ears National Monument is not just for Native Americans but for all Americans,' Vice President Jonathan Nez said. 'This is a sad day for Indigenous people and for America.'\n\nBears Ears is considered some of the most culturally significant land in the American Southwest. Its famous Red Rock Canyon country is dense with ancient artifacts, cliff dwellings and sacred burial grounds. Just a couple of years ago, some of the land was proposed for additional federal protections, but a bill backed by Utah's House Republicans stalled in Congress. Then, last year, the Obama administration held meetings in the region before declaring it a national monument in late December under the 1906 Antiquities Act.\n\nTribal leaders took to the streets of Salt Lake City over the weekend to protest the president's decision. At a rally Saturday, Ethel Branch, attorney general of the Navajo Nation, predicted the president wouldn't even set foot on or see the land in question.\n\n'I want him to visit Bears Ears before he takes any action,' Branch told a cheering crowd at a rally outside the Utah Capitol.\n\nBut Trump did not visit Bears Ears. The monument is more than a five-hour drive from Salt Lake City, and the president's tight schedule, which included a trip to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Welfare Square, brought him home to the White House by the end of the day.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Howard Berkes/NPR Howard Berkes/NPR\n\nNext stop: the courtroom\n\nThe Navajo Nation isn't the only group to announce its intention to sue the Trump administration over his proclamations. Conservationists have also voiced their objections — and their plans to bring those objections to court.\n\nBy late Monday, 10 conservation groups had filed a lawsuit, alleging that Trump's action was 'unlawful' and an abuse of his authority. The suit argues that the law 'authorizes Presidents to create a national monument; it does not authorize Presidents to abolish them either in whole or in part, as President Trump's action attempts to do.'\n\n'I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits,' Yvon Chouinard, founder and CEO of outdoor gear company Patagonia, told CNN. 'We're losing this planet, and we have an evil government. And not just the federal government, but wacko politicians out of Utah and places. I mean, it's evil. And I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win.' The company is not a party in the conservationists' lawsuit.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have proposed changes to the Antiquities Act, which was originally intended to protect against the looting of ancient artifacts from public land, to make it harder for presidents to use it as a means to create large national monuments.\n\nThe law, as written, authorizes the president to designate these monuments — but it is gray on the matter of whether a president can actually shrink or abolish a large, already-existing monument. Sixteen presidents have used the Antiquities Act to create public-lands monuments, but legal experts say that the task of modifying public lands has historically been the role of Congress.\n\n'President Trump's dramatic reduction of the Bears Ears National Monument is a direct attack on the Antiquities Act and America's public lands. We intend to challenge this action in federal court,' Stephanie Meeks, president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said in a statement Monday after the announcement.\n\n'Rolling back the designation of Bears Ears leaves thousands of extraordinary archaeological sites vulnerable to looting and vandalism. The President's action also opens the remarkable Bears Ears' landscape to incompatible oil and gas development.' she said.\n\n'This arbitrary review and illegal action will not go unchallenged,' said Nicole Croft, executive director of Grand Staircase Escalante Partners.\n\nEnvironmentalists like Croft fear the decision could set a precedent for future presidents to unravel protections on federal land.\n\n'The experience of exploration, wonder and humility at the grandeur of the natural world is one our children and their children deserve, and that is what this administration is trying to rob from our future,' she said.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/04/567803476/trump-dramatically-shrinks-2-utah-national-monuments","1512363600.0"
"JFK assassination: Trump to allow release of classified documents\nPresident Trump announced on Twitter that he will allow the release of thousands of classified documents about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy after years of delays.\n\nThe unexpected move means the trove of never-before-seen documents are set to be released by the National Archives by Oct. 26.\n\nSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017\n\n'The President believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise,' a White House official said Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe National Archives has until Thursday to disclose the remaining files related to Kennedy's 1963 assassination. The trove is expected to include more than 3,000 documents that have never been released to the public and more than 30,000 that have been previously released but with redactions.\n\nCongress mandated in 1992 that all assassination documents be released within 25 years, but Mr. Trump has the power to block them on the grounds that making them public would harm intelligence or military operations, law enforcement or foreign relations.\n\n'Thank you. This is the correct decision. Please do not allow exceptions for any agency of government,' tweeted Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of a book about Kennedy, who has urged the president to release the files. 'JFK files have been hidden too long.'\n\nThe anticipated release has had scholars and armchair detectives buzzing. But it's unlikely the documents will contain any big revelations on a tragedy that has stirred conspiracy theories for decades, Judge John Tunheim told The Associated Press last month. Tunheim was chairman of the independent agency in the 1990s that made public many assassination records and decided how long others could remain secret.\n\nSabato and other JFK scholars believe the trove of files may, however, provide insight into assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City weeks before the killing, during which he visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies. Oswald's stated reason for going was to get visas that would allow him to enter Cuba and the Soviet Union, according to the Warren Commission, the investigative body established by President Lyndon B. Johnson, but much about the trip remains unknown.\n\nRoger Stone, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump who wrote a book alleging that Johnson was the driving force behind Kennedy's assassination, had personally urged the president to make the files public, he told far-right conspiracy theorist and radio show host Alex Jones this past week.\n\n'Yesterday, I had the opportunity to make the case directly to the president of the United States by phone as to why I believe it is essential that he release the balance of the currently redacted and classified JFK assassination documents,' Stone said, adding that 'a very good White House source,' but not the president, had told him the Central Intelligence Agency, 'specifically CIA director Mike Pompeo, has been lobbying the president furiously not to release these documents.'\n\n'Why? Because I believe they show that Oswald was trained, nurtured and put in place by the Central Intelligence Agency. It sheds very bad light on the deep state,' he said.\n\nAfter the president announced his decision, Stone tweeted: 'Yes ! victory !'\n\nThe files that were withheld in full were those the Assassination Records Review Board deemed 'not believed relevant,' Tunheim said. Its members sought to ensure they weren't hiding any information directly related to Kennedy's assassination, but there may be nuggets of information in the files that they didn't realize were important two decades ago, he said.\n\n'There could be some jewels in there because in our level of knowledge in the 1990s is maybe different from today,' Tunheim said.\n\nThe National Archives in July published online more than 440 never-before-seen assassination documents and thousands of others that had been released previously with redactions.\n\nAmong those documents was a 1975 internal CIA memo that questioned whether Oswald became motivated to kill Kennedy after reading an AP article in a newspaper that quoted Fidel Castro as saying 'U.S. leaders would be in danger if they helped in any attempt to do away with leaders of Cuba.'","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jfk-assassination-trump-to-allow-release-of-classified-documents/","None"
"The best moments from Adebola Williams' powerful speech at the Obama summit\n(CNN) The Obama Foundation Summit was a gathering of the world's most thoughtful and passionate civic leaders.\n\nFrom October 31st to November 1st, change agents from all walks of life gathered in Chicago to discuss ways to make more meaningful impact in their local communities.\n\nCo-founder of Red Media Africa , Adebola Williams, spoke in the closing session themed 'Collective Power' and earned a standing ovation from the crowd, including Barack Obama after his speech.\n\nSpeaking alongside Williams in this session were award-winning actor and musician Common , author and journalist Anand Giridharadas and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative Bryan Stevenson , among others.\n\nWilliams addressed how youth and the media in Africa can rewrite the hopelessness that has for so long defined the continent.\n\nHere are some of the quotable moments.\n\n1. The African continent is filled with promise\n\nAdebola Williams took us on a brief journey through the popular narrative of Africa as a place of desperation and helplessness to the present day Africa, which he believes is buoyant with promise. Williams believes that young people are doing great things around the continent and will lead its transformation.\n\n2. The hopeless person is a ticking time bomb\n\nFor many underemployed and poor young people in Africa, this is a poignant statement. Williams argues that to be hopeless is to be without direction and purpose. This person is a ticking time bomb.\n\n3. Young people must believe in the power of their own gifts\n\nWilliams says he started Red Media Africa in 2004 with two of his friends to change the narrative of Africa as a place of total deprivation and misery to a place of promise. The idea was to make young people hungry enough for change, for positive impact in their societies.\n\n4. The currency of this generation is talent\n\nWilliams believes that talent can change a lot of situations in Africa. Young people, he believes, need to discover their talents and how to apply these talents to solve specific needs in the society.\n\n5. The media defines our choices\n\nWhile emphasizing the role of the individual person in society, Williams talks about the media as a powerful tool for driving change in Africa.\n\n6. The media must provoke action\n\nHe goes further to talk about the media as the force that not only shapes conversations, but provokes the citizens to act.\n\n7. There's nothing more powerful than a committed group\n\nWilliams also stresses the importance of commitment. Commitment is key, he says. It is key to achieving success. It is key to achieving desired change. When Africans unite and get committed to a cause, they can achieve anything.\n\n8. We must end the conspiracy of silence in Africa\n\nWilliams touches on elections and the power of the electorate to demand accountability from those they have elected. The conspiracy of silence in Africa must not be allowed to continue. It has done the continent no good.\n\n9. Hope is our weapon...action is the remedy\n\nHe calls for hope among Africans, a more responsive media and active citizens who hold leaders accountable. This is where the quest for sustainable change must begin.\n\n10. Leaders are not in power to be feared; they are there to serve\n\nWilliams ends by encouraging young people to hold their leaders accountable. He reminds us again that the citizen is powerful and should take responsibility for driving change in the society.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/03/africa/adebola-williams-speech-barack-obama/index.html","1509681600.0"
"Syria chemical weapons attack toll rises to 70 as Russian narrative is dismissed\nAt least 70 people have been killed in northern Syria after being exposed to a toxic gas that survivors said was dropped from warplanes, an attack that sparked comparisons to the most infamous act of the country’s six-year war.\n\nAt least another 100 people were being treated in hospitals in Idlib province where the strike took place at dawn on Tuesday. Several dozen others were transferred to Turkey, some in critical condition.\n\nCondemnation mounted throughout Tuesday as the US, Britain and EU blamed the Syrian government for the carnage, hours before the start of a donor conference on Syria in Brussels.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump denounced the carnage as a “heinous” act that “cannot be ignored by the civilised world”. But he also laid some of the responsibility on Barack Obama, saying in a statement that the attack was “a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution”.\n\nTheresa May said she was appalled by reports of the attack and called for an investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. “I’m very clear that there can be no future for Assad in a stable Syria which is representative of all the Syrian people and I call on all the third parties involved to ensure that we have a transition away from Assad. We cannot allow this suffering to continue,” she said.\n\n\n\nUK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the latest death toll in Khan Sheikhoun at 72 by Wednesday morning, including 20 children.\n\nThe Syrian military said it “categorically denied” responsibility. Russia, which has heavily backed the Syrian regime, said its planes were not operating near Idlib. Early on Wednesday, the Russian defence ministry claimed a Syrian airstrike had hit a “terrorist warehouse” containing an arsenal of “toxic substances” destined for fighters in Iraq. The ministry did not state if the attack was deliberate.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Hamish de Bretton Gordon, director of Doctors Under Fire and former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment, said this claim was “completely untrue”.\n\n“No I think this [claim] is pretty fanciful, no doubt the Russians trying to protect their allies,” he said. “Axiomatically, if you blow up sarin, you destroy it.”\n\n“It’s very clear it’s a sarin attack,” he added. “The view that it’s an al-Qaida or rebel stockpile of sarin that’s been blown up in an explosion, I think is completely unsustainable and completely untrue.”\n\nHours after the attack, a hospital treating the injured was also hit. Images taken inside the clinic appeared to depict the blast as it happened. Photographs and videos taken at the scene and in evacuation areas nearby showed rows of small, lifeless children, some with foam visible near their mouths.\n\nSave the Children said at least 11 children were among the casualties.\n\n\n\nJerry Smith, the operations chief of the UN-led team that supervised the removal of Syria’s sarin stockpiles following the gas attack on the rebel-held Ghouta area of Damascus four years ago, said: “This absolutely reeks of 2013 all over again.” In that attack, more than 1,300 people were killed. The UN said the perpetrators probably had access to the stockpile of sarin held by the Syrian military at the time, as well as the expertise to use it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man carries the body of a child, after what rescue workers described as a suspected gas attack in the town of Khan Sheikhun. Photograph: Ammar Abdullah/Reuters\n\nIn the aftermath of the Ghouta massacre, a UN team supervised the surrender of Syria’s sarin supplies, the removal of which was supposed to have been completed early in 2014. However, suspicions have remained that a portion of the stockpile was not declared to inspectors.\n\n\n\nTuesday’s attack struck Khan Sheikhun, where there are thousands of refugees from the nearby province of Hama who have fled recent fighting. The town is also on a crossroads between Hama and Idlib and is considered vital to any regime offensive towards the northern city of Idlib.\n\n\n\n“In this most recent attack, dozens of children suffocated to death while they slept,” said Ahmad Tarakji, the head of the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), which supports hospitals in opposition-controlled areas in Syria. “This should strike at the very core of our humanity. How much longer will the world fail to respond to these heinous crimes?”\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Syrian man is escorted by civil defence workers in Khan Sheikhun. Photograph: Mohamed Al-Bakour/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSams said its doctors had determined that the symptoms of the patients were consistent with exposure to organic phosphorus compounds such as the nerve agent sarin, which is banned by the chemical weapons convention.\n\nSmith said: “If you look at the footage itself, the victims don’t have any physical trauma injuries. There is foaming and pinpointed pupils, in particular. This appears to be some kind of organo-phosphate poison. In theory, a nerve agent. What is striking is that it would appear to be more than chlorine. The toxicity of chlorine does not lend itself to the sort of injuries and numbers that we have seen.”\n\nTuesday’s strike came days after the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the Trump administration was no longer prioritising the removal of Assad, and that the Syrian people would ultimately decide his fate.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A crater is seen at the site of an airstrike. Photograph: Ammar Abdullah/Reuters\n\nThe US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, made similar comments on Monday, affirming a shift in US policy that began under the Obama administration.\n\nCritics of the stance have said that the absence of a credible threat has given the regime licence to commit war crimes with impunity as its backers, Iran and Russia, steadily claw back years of battlefield losses.\n\n\n\nThe UN security council said it would hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack, after a request from Britain and France.\n\n“Everyone is horrified and the children are in total shock,” said Mohammad Hassoun, a spokesman for civil defence rescue workers in the nearby town of Sarmin, which received 14 of the wounded from Tuesday’s attack. Hassoun said the victims were bleeding from the nose and mouth, had constricted irises and suffered from convulsions.\n\n\n\nChemical weapons attacks in Syria may normalise war crimes, experts warn Read more\n\n“The total number of wounded is incredible. So far it’s over 200,” said Mohammad, a doctor at another hospital in Idlib. “We received over 20 victims and most of them are children, and two of them in the ICU are extremely critical. There are a lot of injured.” Mohammad said the victims he had seen were drifting in and out of consciousness. Many were on respirators.\n\nFew hospitals in Idlib have the capacity to deal with the symptoms of chemical attacks due to the repeated bombing of medical facilities by forces loyal to the government and lack sufficient oxygen tanks to treat victims.\n\nIdlib is one of the last bastions of rebel control in Syria, and has been subjected to a relentless campaign of aerial bombardment despite a supposed ceasefire brokered this year by Russia and Turkey that was aimed at paving the way for political negotiations.\n\nThe raid in Khan Sheikhun indicates Assad’s growing confidence. He has wrested control of territory from the rebels, including the entire city of Aleppo, in recent months. His regime has benefited from the unflinching support of Moscow and Shia militias backed by Iran, as well as waning support for the opposition by its allies in the region and the new US administration.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man breathes through an oxygen mask as another receives treatment. Photograph: Ammar Abdullah/Reuters\n\nThe attack will refocus attention on the failure of the international community to prevent the worst abuses in Syria’s war, and casts doubt on a signature achievement of Obama’s government, which negotiated the presumed destruction of Assad’s chemical arsenal in 2013.\n\nThat deal followed the sarin gas attack on Ghouta, which nearly prompted a US intervention in the conflict. Since then, chemical attacks have continued on a smaller scale, mostly deploying chlorine gas, which was not covered by the deal because it has industrial uses.\n\nHowever, a similar devastating attack to the Idlib strike took place in east Hama last December, with at least 93 people dying and several hundred more being wounded after exposure to what local authorities described as a nerve agent. Western intelligence agencies believe sarin was used in that attack, but were unable to retrieve biological samples that could prove their fears.\n\nSmith said the recovery of samples would be pivotal to the investigation of the Idlib strike. “It is one of the most important things now to get biological samples, interviews and environmental samples, ideally from witnesses who can also give statements,” he said.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/syria-chemical-attack-idlib-province","1491278400.0"
"Brexit: Government reveals plans for UK's exit from EU\nLondon (CNN) The British government formally set out details for the first time Thursday of its strategy for Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\nThe 77-page 'white paper' was published a day after lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill that once finalized would give May the authority to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty -- the formal process of leaving the EU.\n\nIt contained few clues about the government's overall strategy that were not evident in a speech delivered by Prime Minister Theresa May in January . But it fleshed out aspects of May's plan in some key areas.\n\nThe white paper said:\n\n• The UK will seek a 'new strategic partnership' with Europe. While the UK would leave the EU single market and customs union, it would seek to keep 'elements' of the free-trade zone.\n\n• No 'cliff-edge' Brexit. The government said it would seek transitional arrangements to minimize the impact of Britain's departure front he EU.\n\n• Early targets for trade deals would be the US, China, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, India and states in the Persian Gulf. It would seek 'continuity' of arrangements with other countries that are currently covered by EU deals.\n\n• The government hopes for an 'early' agreement on the status of the 2.8 million EU nationals who live in the UK. It expressed disappointment that a number of EU states had blocked attempts to sort the issue out before formal divorce talks begin.\n\n• It offered no guarantee on the status of the Irish border. The government said only that it would 'aim' to protect the common travel area that exists between Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU. The issue is a key part of the deal that brought peace to Northern Ireland.\n\nIn a foreword to the white paper, May said Britain approached the negotiations anticipating success, not failure.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis speaks in the House of Commons.\n\n'The House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly for us to get on with it. And the overwhelming majority of people -- however they voted -- want us to get on with it too,' she said.\n\nDavid Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, told the House of Commons that Britain wanted the 'European Union to succeed, politically and economically' and so would approach the negotiations in the 'spirit of goodwill' and for both sides' mutual benefit.\n\nImmigration: 'Nobody will be thrown out'\n\nAround 2.8 million EU nationals live in the UK, many of them Polish. Around 1 million UK nationals live in other member states, 300,000 of them in Spain.\n\nProtestors demonstrate against Brexit in Parliament Square.\n\nResolving the status of both groups was an 'early priority', the white paper said. It indicated frustration with other EU states that it had not already been dealt with. 'The government would have liked to resolve this issue ahead of formal negotiations,' it said.\n\nWhile welcoming the contribution of migrants to Britain's economy and society, the white paper said there had been 'record levels of long-term net migration in the UK and that sheer volume has given rise to public concern.' It cites pressure on housing, infrastructure, public services and downward pressure on wages for those on the lowest incomes.\n\n'We will design our immigration system to ensure that we are able to control the numbers of people who come here from the EU,' it says. 'In future, therefore, the Free Movement Directive will no longer apply and the migration of EU nationals will be subject to UK law.'\n\nPressed in the House of Commons by opposition Labour spokesman Keir Starmer, Davis said EU nationals would not be forced to leave the UK. 'I am not going to be throwing people out of Britain and for him to suggest that is outrageous,' he said.\n\nIrish border: 'Aim' to keep current arrangements\n\nUnder the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, there is currently an open border between the north and south. Any change to this arrangement would imperil the peace process, critics have warned.\n\nHowever, there are doubts that the UK could maintain an open border with an EU member state -- and the white paper acknowledges the doubts, saying only that the government 'aims' to maintain the current arrangements.\n\nSpeaking last month, May said that finding a solution to the border issue would be 'an important priority,' adding that 'nobody wants to return to the borders of the past, so we will make it a priority to deliver a practical solution as soon as we can.'\n\nTrade: 'No need to start from scratch'\n\nThe government will seek to retain a large part of the country's current trade arrangements with the EU, but emphasizes the need to boost trade with other states, citing growth in its exports to South Korea, China, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nThe paper reiterates May's recent announcement that Britain will not remain in the union's single market but will instead seek 'the freest and most frictionless trade possible in goods and services between the UK and the EU.'\n\nBrexit secretary David Davis outlined plans in the House of Commons.\n\nBut the document made it clear that the UK wanted to retain some parts of the present single market arrangements, saying it 'makes no sense to start again from scratch' in areas where rules have existed for years.\n\nThe government will seek the freest possible trade in financial services, a key sector for Britain's economy.\n\nSeveral prominent financial institutions based in London have suggested moving jobs to EU states to remain part of the single market. From within the EU, Britain has been able to provide financial services across the union under a common set of rules and regulatory authority -- access known in the sector as 'passporting.'\n\nMore than 5,000 UK firms use passporting to provide services to the EU, while around 8,000 European firms use the instrument to provide services to Britain, and UK-based financial institutions have lobbied the government to try to retain passporting rights.\n\nThe government hopes to seek new opportunities and reform policy in the agriculture, food and fisheries sectors, which the paper described as 'currently heavily influenced by EU laws.'\n\nSecurity: 'Deepen security cooperation'\n\nThe government says it will continue to work with the EU in fighting terrorism and maintaining security, adding it is 'uniquely placed to develop and sustain a mutually beneficial model of cooperation.'\n\nIt says that the UK is 'driving or co-driving' approximately half of the Europol projects against organized crime, and cites the extradition of more than 8,000 individuals accused or convicted of a criminal offense to other EU countries under the European Arrest Warrant.\n\nIt reiterates its willingness to work with EU allies over criminal matters, security and cyber security while upholding its commitments to NATO.\n\nIt also highlights that it will 'seek a strong and close future relationship with the EU with focus on operational and practical cross-border cooperation.'\n\nTransition: 'No cliff-edge'\n\nThe government says it wants to deliver a smooth, orderly exit and to 'avoid a disruptive cliff-edge' as Britain leaves the European Union.\n\nThe government envisages finalizing a deal within the expected two-year period after triggering Article 50, but seeks a phased transition after that, to maintain stability and give businesses and institutions time to adjust.\n\nIt does not give a timeline for how long the whole process might take, saying some elements will be phased in faster than others. But it stresses Britain will not seek an 'unlimited transitional status' which would be good for neither side.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/europe/brexit-white-paper/index.html","1486011600.0"
"North Korea’s Missile Success Is Linked to Ukrainian Plant, Investigators Say\nBut since Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was removed from power in 2014, the state-owned factory, known as Yuzhmash, has fallen on hard times. The Russians canceled upgrades of their nuclear fleet. The factory is underused, awash in unpaid bills and low morale. Experts believe it is the most likely source of the engines that in July powered the two ICBM tests, which were the first to suggest that North Korea has the range, if not necessarily the accuracy or warhead technology, to threaten American cities.\n\n“It’s likely that these engines came from Ukraine — probably illicitly,” Mr. Elleman said in an interview. “The big question is how many they have and whether the Ukrainians are helping them now. I’m very worried.”\n\nBolstering his conclusion, he added, was a finding by United Nations investigators that North Korea tried six years ago to steal missile secrets from the Ukrainian complex. Two North Koreans were caught, and a U.N. report said the information they tried to steal was focused on advanced “missile systems, liquid-propellant engines, spacecraft and missile fuel supply systems.”\n\nInvestigators now believe that, amid the chaos of post-revolutionary Ukraine, Pyongyang tried again.\n\nMr. Elleman’s detailed analysis is public confirmation of what intelligence officials have been saying privately for some time: The new missiles are based on a technology so complex that it would have been impossible for the North Koreans to have switched gears so quickly themselves. They apparently fired up the new engine for the first time in September — meaning that it took only 10 months to go from that basic milestone to firing an ICBM, a short time unless they were able to buy designs, hardware and expertise on the black market.\n\nBELARUS POLAND RUSSIA Kiev UKRAINE Dnieper River Dnipro MOLDOVA ROMANIA Sea of Azov Crimea Black Sea 100 Miles Disputed BULGARIA BELARUS 100 Miles RUSSIA Kiev Dnieper River UKRAINE Dnipro MOLDOVA Sea of Azov Crimea Disputed RUSSIA Black Sea\n\nThe White House had no comment when asked about the intelligence assessments.\n\nLast month, Yuzhmash denied reports that the factory complex was struggling for survival and selling its technologies abroad, in particular to China. Its website says the company does not, has not and will not participate in “the transfer of potentially dangerous technologies outside Ukraine.”\n\nAmerican investigators do not believe that denial, though they say there is no evidence that the government of President Petro O. Poroshenko, who recently visited the White House, had any knowledge or control over what was happening inside the complex.\n\nOn Monday, after this story was published, Oleksandr Turchynov, a top national security official in the government of Mr. Poroshenko, denied any Ukrainian involvement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“This information is not based on any grounds, provocative by its content, and most likely provoked by Russian secret services to cover their own crimes,” Mr. Turchynov said. He said the Ukrainian government views North Korea as “totalitarian, dangerous and unpredictable, and supports all sanctions against this country.”\n\nHow the Russian-designed engines, called the RD-250, got to North Korea is still a mystery.\n\nMr. Elleman was unable to rule out the possibility that a large Russian missile enterprise, Energomash, which has strong ties to the Ukrainian complex, had a role in the transfer of the RD-250 engine technology to North Korea. He said leftover RD-250 engines might also be stored in Russian warehouses.\n\nBut the fact that the powerful engines did get to North Korea, despite a raft of United Nations sanctions, suggests a broad intelligence failure involving the many nations that monitor Pyongyang.\n\nSince President Barack Obama ordered a step-up in sabotage against the North’s missile systems in 2014, American officials have closely monitored their success. They appeared to have won a major victory last fall, when Mr. Kim ordered an end to flight tests of the Musudan, an intermediate-range missile that was a focus of the American sabotage effort.\n\nBut no sooner had Mr. Kim ordered a stand-down of that system than the North rolled out engines of a different design. And those tests were more successful.\n\nAmerican officials will not say when they caught on to the North’s change of direction. But there is considerable evidence they came to it late.\n\nPhoto\n\nLeon Panetta, the former C.I.A. director, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the North Korean drive to get workable ICBMs that could be integrated with nuclear weapons moved more quickly than the intelligence community had expected.\n\n“The rapid nature of how they’ve been able to come to that capability is something, frankly, that has surprised both the United States and the world,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is unclear who is responsible for selling the rockets and the design knowledge, and intelligence officials have differing theories about the details.

The sprawling factory, southeast of Kiev and once a dynamo of the Cold War, is having a hard time finding customers.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials note that North Korea has exploited the black market in missile technology for decades, and built an infrastructure of universities, design centers and factories of its own.\n\nIt has also recruited help: In 1992, officials at a Moscow airport stopped a team of missile experts from traveling to Pyongyang.\n\nThat was only a temporary setback for North Korea. It obtained the design for the R-27, a compact missile made for Soviet submarines, created by the Makeyev Design Bureau, an industrial complex in the Ural Mountains that employed the rogue experts apprehended at the Moscow airport.\n\nBut the R-27 was complicated, and the design was difficult for the North to copy and fly successfully.\n\nPhoto\n\nEventually, the North turned to an alternative font of engine secrets — the Yuzhmash plant in Ukraine, as well as its design bureau, Yuzhnoye. The team’s engines were potentially easier to copy because they were designed not for cramped submarines but roomier land-based missiles. That simplified the engineering.\n\nEconomically, the plant and design bureau faced new headwinds after Russia in early 2014 invaded and annexed Crimea, a part of Ukraine. Relations between the two nations turned icy, and Moscow withdrew plans to have Yuzhmash make new versions of the SS-18 missile.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn July 2014, a report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace warned that such economic upset could put Ukrainian missile and atomic experts “out of work and could expose their crucial know-how to rogue regimes and proliferators.”\n\nThe first clues that a Ukrainian engine had fallen into North Korean hands came in September when Mr. Kim supervised a ground test of a new rocket engine that analysts called the biggest and most powerful to date.\n\nNorbert Brügge, a German analyst, reported that photos of the engine firing revealed strong similarities between it and the RD-250, a Yuzhmash model.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/world/asia/north-korea-missiles-ukraine-factory.html","1502683200.0"
"Special Report: 'Treacherous shenanigans' - The inside story of Mugabe's downfall\nHARARE (Reuters) - Inside State House in Harare, Robert Mugabe was in the tightest spot of his 37-year rule. Tanks were on the streets and troops had occupied the state broadcaster, from where the army had announced it had taken control of Zimbabwe.\n\nFILE PHOTO: President Robert Mugabe listens to his wife Grace Mugabe at a rally of his ruling ZANU(PF) party in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 8, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo\n\nMugabe, 93 years old but still alert, remained defiant. The only leader the country had known since independence was refusing to quit.\n\nAt a tense meeting with his military top brass on Nov. 16, the world’s oldest head of state put his foot down: “Bring me the constitution and tell me what it says,” he ordered military chief Constantino Chiwenga, according to two sources present.\n\nAn aide brought a copy of the constitution, which lays out that the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\nChiwenga, dressed in camouflage fatigues, hesitated before replying that Zimbabwe was facing a national crisis that demanded military intervention.\n\nMugabe retorted that the army was the problem, according to the sources present. Then the beleaguered president indicated that perhaps they could find a solution together.\n\nThe meeting marked the start of an extraordinary five-day standoff between Mugabe and Zimbabwe’s supreme law on one side, and the military, his party and Zimbabwe’s people on the other.\n\nThe generals wanted Mugabe to go, but they also wanted a peaceful “coup,” one that would not irreparably tarnish the administration aiming to take over, according to multiple military and political sources.\n\nThe president finally accepted defeat only after he was sacked by his own ZANU-PF party and faced the ignominy of impeachment. He signed a short letter of resignation to parliament speaker Jacob Mudenda that was read out to lawmakers on Nov. 21.\n\nMugabe, who had run Zimbabwe since 1980 and overseen its descent into economic ruin while his wife shopped for luxury goods, was gone.\n\nThe country erupted into ecstasy. Parliamentarians danced and people poured onto the streets in their tens of thousands to celebrate a political downfall that sent shockwaves across Africa and the world.\n\nTo many, the end of Mugabe had been unthinkable only one week before.\n\nReuters has pieced together the events leading up to Mugabe’s removal, showing that the army’s action was the culmination of months of planning that stretched from Harare to Johannesburg to Beijing.\n\nBITTER RIVALRY\n\nDrawing on a trove of intelligence documents from within Mugabe’s feared Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), Reuters reported in September that the army was backing Emmerson Mnangagwa, then vice president, to succeed Mugabe when the time came.\n\nThe report detailed how Mnangagwa, a lifelong friend and former security chief of Mugabe, might cooperate with Mugabe’s political foes in order to revive the economy. It caused furore in Zimbabwe’s media and political circles.\n\nBitter rivalry intensified between Mnangagwa and Grace, Mugabe’s 52-year-old wife, who also hoped to take over as president and had the backing of a ZANU-PF faction known as G40.\n\nIn early October, Mnangagwa said he had been airlifted to hospital in South Africa after a poisoning attempt in August. He pointed no fingers - but he didn’t need to.\n\nGrace’s swift response was to deny it and accuse her rival of seeking sympathy; she belittled him as nothing but an employee of her husband, according to a report in the state-run Herald newspaper.\n\nAs the pressure built, Mugabe became increasingly paranoid about the loyalty of army chief Chiwenga, a career soldier and decorated veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1970s bush-war against white-minority rule.\n\nMugabe’s spies, who permeated every institution and section of society in Zimbabwe, were warning him the military would not accept Grace as president.\n\n“Mugabe is very worried of a coup,” one intelligence report, dated Oct. 23, said. “Mugabe was openly told by senior CIOs that the military is not going to easily accept the appointment of Grace. He was warned to be ready for civil war.”\n\nReuters reviewed the document, and hundreds of other intelligence reports dating back to 2009, before the coup took place. The documents come from within the CIO, but Reuters could not determine for whom they were written. The CIO is split into factions, some pro- and some anti-Mugabe.\n\nIn late October, Mugabe summoned Chiwenga to a showdown, according to another of the documents, dated Oct. 30. It said Mugabe confronted the army chief about his ties to Mnangagwa and told him that going against Grace would cost him his life.\n\n“Chiwenga was warned by Mugabe that it is high time for him to start following. He mentioned to Chiwenga that those fighting his wife are bound to die a painful death,” the intelligence report said.\n\nAt the same meeting, Mugabe also ordered Chiwenga to pledge allegiance to Grace. He refused.\n\n“Chiwengwa refused to be intimidated. He stood his ground over his loyalty to Mnangagwa,” the report said.\n\nReuters put questions about this exchange and other aspects of this article to Mugabe’s spokesman, George Charamba. In an enigmatic text message dated Nov. 23, he replied: “Enjoy Reuters copy. Goodnight.”\n\nTwo spokesmen for Chiwenga declined to comment.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Military vehicles and soldiers patrol the streets in Harare, Zimbabwe, November 15, 2017. Picture taken November 15, 2017. REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File Photo\n\nAfter another tense meeting with Mugabe on Nov. 5, Chiwenga left Harare on a pre-arranged official trip and traveled to China, which wields significant influence as a major investor in Zimbabwe.\n\nA day later, Mugabe sacked Mnangagwa as vice president and purged him from ZANU-PF, the liberation movement that Mnangagwa had served since his youth and for which, as a young militant caught bombing a train, he had nearly been executed.\n\nFor the generals, Mugabe had gone too far. The military immediately activated a “Code Red” alert, its highest level of preparedness, a military source said.\n\nASSASSINATION PLOT\n\nMoments after Mnangagwa was ousted on Nov. 6, the security details assigned to him and his house were withdrawn, according to a statement he issued later. He was told his life was in danger.\n\n“Security personnel, who are friendly to me, warned me that plans were underfoot to eliminate me once arrested and taken to a police station,” Mnangagwa said in a Nov. 21 statement. “It was in my security interest to leave the country immediately.”\n\nFrom Harare, he managed to escape over the border into neighboring Mozambique, where he caught a plane to China, according to one source familiar with his movements. There he met up with Chiwenga, the source said.\n\nReuters could not confirm the account; but an intelligence report from Nov. 13 indicates that Mugabe suspected some of his generals of preparing to overthrow him from China.\n\n“A number of generals are now in China ready to plot Mugabe’s ouster with Mnangagwa,” the report said. It was not clear which generals, and whether their travel to China was authorized.\n\nMugabe’s spies suspected old allies had turned against the aging president. An intelligence report, dated Oct. 30, said Beijing and Moscow both supported regime change out of frustration at Zimbabwe’s economic implosion under Mugabe.\n\n“China and Russia are after change,” the report said. “They are after change within ZANU-PF as they are sick and tired of Mugabe’s leadership.”\n\n“The two countries are even ready to clandestinely supply arms of war to Mnangagwa to fight Mugabe.”\n\nNeither China’s Defense Ministry nor Foreign Ministry responded to a request for comment. The Foreign Ministry had previously said Chiwenga’s visit was “a normal military exchange mutually agreed upon by China and Zimbabwe.”\n\nReuters sent written requests for comment to the Kremlin, the Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian Foreign Ministry. None of them responded.\n\nChina has long taken an interest in Zimbabwe, having supported Mugabe’s forces during the liberation struggle. After independence it developed connections there in mining, security and construction.\n\nRussia has also had ties to Zimbabwe since the early 1980s, and in 2014 a Russian consortium entered into a partnership to develop a $3 billion platinum mining project in the country.\n\nChiwenga’s trip to China culminated in him meeting Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan in Beijing on Nov. 10.\n\nTwo sources with knowledge of the talks told Reuters that Chiwenga asked if China would agree not to interfere if he took temporary control in Zimbabwe to remove Mugabe from power. Chang assured him Beijing would not get involved and the two also discussed tactics that might be employed during the de facto coup, the sources said.\n\nReuters could not establish whether Mnangagwa met Chang.\n\nHaving got wind of the talks in China, Mugabe summoned his still-loyal police commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, and his deputy, Innocent Matibiri, to detain Chiwenga on his return to Harare, government and security sources said.\n\nThe pair assembled a squad of 100 police and intelligence agents. But the plot leaked and Chiwenga supporters managed to pull together a counter-team of several hundred special forces soldiers and agents as their commander’s plane approached.\n\nSome were disguised as baggage handlers, their military fatigues and weapons hidden beneath high-visibility jackets and overalls, one security source said.\n\nRealizing they were outnumbered and outgunned, Chihuri’s police team backed down, allowing Chiwenga to touch down without incident, the security source said.\n\nMugabe’s spokesman did not comment on the incident.\n\n“VERY ALARMED”\n\nTwo days later, Chiwenga and a group of military commanders demanded a meeting with Mugabe at his official State House residence in Harare, an ornate colonial villa complete with stuffed leopards and thick red carpets, according to a government source.\n\nThey said they were “very alarmed” at the firing of Mnangagwa and told Mugabe to rein in his wife and her G40 faction, whom they accused of trying to divide the military, according to the government official, who was present at the discussions.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\n“What do you think should be done?” Mugabe demanded of the soldiers as he sat slumped in an armchair.\n\nThe generals asked him to give assurances that they too would not be purged. Mugabe’s response was lukewarm, the government source said. Chiwenga told Mugabe he would be making his concerns about the G40 faction public.\n\nHours later, Chiwenga summoned reporters to the military’s main barracks near Harare to issue a statement.\n\n“We must remind those behind the current treacherous shenanigans that, when it comes to matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in,” he said, reading from a prepared text.\n\nThe following afternoon, Reuters reported six armored personnel carriers heading towards the headquarters of Mugabe’s Presidential Guard on the outskirts of Harare. It was unclear whose command they were under.\n\nAt the time, the city’s residents were on edge but still unsure what it all meant.\n\nTHE LINE WENT DEAD\n\nAt around 6 p.m. on Nov. 14, Mugabe’s motorcade headed to his private “Blue Roof” residence, a heavily fortified compound in the capital’s leafy northern suburb of Borrowdale.\n\nMeanwhile, social media buzzed with pictures of armored vehicles driving along roads to Harare, sparking frenzied speculation about a coup.\n\nIncreasingly concerned, Grace put in a call shortly after 7 p.m. to a cabinet minister asking to get WhatsApp and Twitter shut down, according to one source familiar with a recording of the conversation.\n\nThe minister, whose identity Reuters is withholding for safety reasons, replied that such a move was the responsibility of state security minister Kembo Mohadi.\n\n“No-one will stand for a coup. It cannot happen,” said Grace, commonly referred to as Amai, which means Mother, according to a source who heard the recording.\n\nMugabe’s voice is then heard on the line: “As you have heard from Amai, is there anything that can be done?”\n\nThe minister gave the same response, about the responsibilities of state security, and the line went dead, the source said.\n\nMohadi declined to comment.\n\nTwo hours later, two armored vehicles rolled into the Pockets Hill headquarters of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), according to ZBC sources.\n\nDozens of soldiers sealed off the site and stormed into the studios where they accosted staff, snatching their phones and halting programs. State-owned ZBC, widely seen as a mouthpiece for Mugabe, switched to broadcasting pop music videos.\n\nMugabe’s inner circle, nearly all of them G40 loyalists, had no idea what was under way, according to four sources familiar with their conversations.\n\nInformation Minister Simon Khaya Moyo called Defense Minister Sydney Sekeramayi to ask if he had any information about a possible coup. Sekeramayi said no, but tried to check with military chief Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga told Sekeramayi he would get back to him. According to the sources, Chiwenga never did.\n\nMoyo remains in hiding and was unavailable for comment. Sekeramayi declined to comment.\n\nSECURITY DETAIL\n\nAs ministers in the G40 faction tried frantically to work out what was going on, Chiwenga’s men closed in on Mugabe’s compound.\n\nAccording to a source briefed on the situation, Albert Ngulube, a CIO director and head of Mugabe’s security detail, was driving home around 9.30 p.m. after visiting Mugabe. He met an armored car on Borrowdale Brooke, a side road leading to Mugabe’s house.\n\nWhen Ngulube confronted the soldiers and threatened to shoot them, they beat him up and detained him, the source said. Ngulube was later released, but had suffered head and facial injuries, the source added.\n\nSpokesmen for Chiwenga and Mnangagwa declined to comment. Reuters was unable to contact Ngulube.\n\nOther G40 ministers were also picked up by soldiers. Finance minister Ignatius Chombo was found hiding in a toilet at his house and beaten before being detained at an undisclosed location for more than a week.\n\nOn his release on Nov. 24, he was hospitalized with injuries to his hands, legs and back, his lawyer told Reuters, describing the army’s behavior as “brutal and draconian.”\n\nSoldiers used explosives to blow the front door off the house of Jonathan Moyo, the main brains behind G40, according to video footage of the house seen by Reuters. Others burst through the front gates of the residence of local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, another key Grace supporter.\n\nBoth men managed to escape to Mugabe’s residence. Contacted by Reuters shortly after midnight in the early hours of Nov. 15, Kasukuwere was audibly stressed. “I can’t talk. I’m in a meeting,” he said, before hanging up.\n\nFor another week, Mugabe clung on to the presidency as Chiwenga and his forces tried to engineer a peaceful, and quasi-legal, exit for the long-serving leader.\n\nBut as parliament began impeachment proceedings on Nov. 21, Mugabe finally gave up. After 37 years in control, during which much of his country fell into poverty, his letter of resignation said he was stepping down out of “concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-politics-mugabe-specialrepor/special-report-treacherous-shenanigans-the-inside-story-of-mugabes-downfall-idUSKBN1DQ0AG","1511793620.0"

"Distrustful U.S. allies force spy agency to back down in encryption fight\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An international group of cryptography experts has forced the U.S. National Security Agency to back down over two data encryption techniques it wanted set as global industry standards, reflecting deep mistrust among close U.S. allies.\n\nIn interviews and emails seen by Reuters, academic and industry experts from countries including Germany, Japan and Israel worried that the U.S. electronic spy agency was pushing the new techniques not because they were good encryption tools, but because it knew how to break them.\n\nThe NSA has now agreed to drop all but the most powerful versions of the techniques - those least likely to be vulnerable to hacks - to address the concerns.\n\nThe dispute, which has played out in a series of closed-door meetings around the world over the past three years and has not been previously reported, turns on whether the International Organization of Standards should approve two NSA data encryption techniques, known as Simon and Speck.\n\nThe U.S. delegation to the ISO on encryption issues includes a handful of NSA officials, though it is controlled by an American standards body, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\n\nThe presence of the NSA officials and former NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations about the agency’s penetration of global electronic systems have made a number of delegates suspicious of the U.S. delegation’s motives, according to interviews with a dozen current and former delegates.\n\nA number of them voiced their distrust in emails to one another, seen by Reuters, and in written comments that are part of the process. The suspicions stem largely from internal NSA documents disclosed by Snowden that showed the agency had previously plotted to manipulate standards and promote technology it could penetrate. Budget documents, for example, sought funding to “insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems.”\n\nMore than a dozen of the experts involved in the approval process for Simon and Speck feared that if the NSA was able to crack the encryption techniques, it would gain a “back door” into coded transmissions, according to the interviews and emails and other documents seen by Reuters.\n\n“I don’t trust the designers,” Israeli delegate Orr Dunkelman, a computer science professor at the University of Haifa, told Reuters, citing Snowden’s papers. “There are quite a lot of people in NSA who think their job is to subvert standards. My job is to secure standards.”\n\nThe NSA, which does not confirm the authenticity of any Snowden documents, told Reuters it developed the new encryption tools to protect sensitive U.S. government computer and communications equipment without requiring a lot of computer processing power.\n\nNSA officials said via email they want commercial technology companies that sell to the government to use the techniques, and that is more likely to happen when they have been designated a global standard by the ISO.\n\nAsked if it could beat Simon and Speck encryption, the NSA officials said: “We firmly believe they are secure.”\n\nTHE CASE OF THE DUAL ELLIPTIC CURVE\n\nISO, an independent organization with delegations from 162 member countries, sets standards on everything from medical packaging to road signs. Its working groups can spend years picking best practices and technologies for an ISO seal of approval.\n\nAs the fight over Simon and Speck played out, the ISO twice voted to delay the multi-stage process of approving them.\n\nIn oral and written comments, opponents cited the lack of peer-reviewed publication by the creators, the absence of industry adoption or a clear need for the new ciphers, and the partial success of academics in showing their weaknesses.\n\nSome ISO delegates said much of their skepticism stemmed from the 2000s, when NSA experts invented a component for encryption called Dual Elliptic Curve and got it adopted as a global standard.\n\nISO’s approval of Dual EC was considered a success inside the agency, according to documents passed by Snowden to the founders of the online news site The Intercept, which made them available to Reuters. The documents said the agency guided the Dual EC proposal through four ISO meetings until it emerged as a standard.\n\nIn 2007, mathematicians in private industry showed that Dual EC could hide a back door, theoretically enabling the NSA to eavesdrop without detection. After the Snowden leaks, Reuters reported that the U.S. government had paid security company RSA $10 million to include Dual EC in a software development kit that was used by programmers around the world.\n\nThe ISO and other standards groups subsequently retracted their endorsements of Dual EC. The NSA declined to discuss it.\n\nIn the case of Simon and Speck, the NSA says the formulas are needed for defensive purposes. But the official who led the now-disbanded NSA division responsible for defense, known as the Information Assurance Directorate, said his unit did not develop Simon and Speck.\n\n“There are probably some legitimate questions around whether these ciphers are actually needed,” said Curtis Dukes, who retired earlier this year. Similar encryption techniques already exist, and the need for new ones is theoretical, he said.\n\nANSI, the body that leads the U.S. delegation to the ISO, said it had simply forwarded the NSA proposals to the organization and had not endorsed them.\n\nFROM JAIPUR TO HAMILTON\n\nWhen the United States first introduced Simon and Speck as a proposed ISO standard in 2014, experts from several countries expressed reservations, said Shin’ichiro Matsuo, the head of the Japanese encryption delegation.\n\nSome delegates had no objection. Chris Mitchell, a member of the British delegation, said he supported Simon and Speck, noting that “no one has succeeded in breaking the algorithms.” He acknowledged, though, that after the Dual EC revelations, “trust, particularly for U.S. government participants in standardization, is now non-existent.”\n\nAt a meeting in Jaipur, India, in October 2015, NSA officials in the American delegation pushed back against critics, questioning their expertise, witnesses said.\n\nA German delegate at the Jaipur talks, Christian Wenzel-Benner, subsequently sent an email seeking support from dozens of cryptographers. He wrote that all seven German experts were “very concerned” about Simon and Speck.\n\n“How can we expect companies and citizens to use security algorithms from ISO standards if those algorithms come from a source that has compromised security-related ISO standards just a few years ago?” Wenzel-Benner asked.\n\nSuch views helped delay Simon and Speck again, delegates said. But the Americans kept pushing, and at an October 2016 meeting in Abu Dhabi, a majority of individual delegates approved the techniques, moving them up to a country-by-country vote.\n\nThere, the proposal fell one vote short of the required two-thirds majority.\n\nFinally, at a March 2017 meeting in Hamilton, New Zealand, the Americans distributed a 22-page explanation of its design and a summary of attempts to break them - the sort of paper that formed part of what delegates had been seeking since 2014.\n\nSimon and Speck, aimed respectively at hardware and software, each have robust versions and more “lightweight” variants. The Americans agreed in Hamilton to compromise and dropped the most lightweight versions.\n\nOpponents saw that as a major if partial victory, and it paved the way to compromise. In another nation-by-nation poll last month, the sturdiest versions advanced to the final stage of the approval process, again by a single vote, with Japan, Germany and Israel remaining opposed. A final vote takes place in February.\n\nFILE PHOTO - An aerial view shows the National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters in Ft. Meade, Maryland, U.S. on January 29, 2010.

"Spanish Police Fatally Shoot Suspect in Barcelona Terror Attack\nPolice also said on Twitter that so far there were four detained suspects and eight dead suspected terrorists in connection with the attacks in Barcelona and the nearby seaside town of Cambrils, where an additional person was killed in a separate attack.\n\nCatalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said at the press conference that members of the public called authorities when they saw Abouyaaqoub at a train station.\n\nWhen police found him near a vineyard, Abouyaaqoub opened his shirt and shouted 'Allahu Akbar' while wearing a suspicious belt, Trapero said. Police then shot him and he was identified by fingerprint matching, he added.\n\nTrapero added that the apparent suicide belt was a fake and did not have any explosives. Abouyaaqoubwas carrying several 'knives and daggers,' he added.\n\nPolice had named Abouyaaquoub as the only remaining suspect yet to be arrested after the attacks, but said Monday that the investigation was still ongoing.\n\nPolice gave a detailed account of how Abouyaaquoub, 22, allegedly careened down a busy Barcelona thoroughfare — killing 13 and injuring more than 100.\n\nThey said he escaped the scene on foot, stabbed to death another driver and took his car before mowing down a policewoman.\n\nPolice said Abouyaaquoub's fled through La Rambla via the nearby La Boqueria food market, walking just under four miles to the city’s university neighborhood where he then killed 34-year-old Pau Perez and took his vehicle.\n\nPerez is the 15th person to be named by police as a victim in the attacks.\n\nPolice said they tried to stop Abouyaaqoub in the university neighborhood, firing shots at the car but he slipped the net, running over a policewoman in the process.\n\nYounes Abouyaaqoub, one of the suspects in the Spain terror attacks, is on the run.

"Brawley, California, earthquake swarm rocks New Year's\nStory highlights California town hit by more than 100 minor earthquakes\n\nEarthquake swarms not uncommon for the area, experts say\n\n(CNN) Dozens of earthquakes helped bring in the New Year around Brawley, California, but they are more of a curiosity than a concern, experts tell CNN.\n\nCaltech seismologist Lucy Jones said earthquake 'swarms' aren't unexpected around Brawley -- there also was a swarm in 2012 -- because the fault-riddled region called the Brawley Seismic Zone lies between the large San Andreas Fault and the Imperial Fault.\n\nMore than 100 earthquakes have hit the region this weekend, but most are too weak, under 2.5 magnitude, to be noticed by people, said Donyelle Davis, spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey.\n\nWeak quakes can trigger a bigger, more dangerous quake, but Brawley, a city of about 25,000 people near the Mexican border, is too far from the San Andreas Fault for that to be much of a risk, Davis said.\n\n'This area may have produced the most earthquakes in the entire state of California, but they are small,' Jones said.

"U.S. War Footprint Grows in Middle East, With No Endgame in Sight\nConcerns about the recent accusations of civilian casualties are bringing some of these details to light. But some of the shifts have also involved small increases in the deployment and use of American forces or, in Yemen, resuming aid to allies that had previously been suspended.\n\nAnd they coincide with the settling in of a president who has vowed to intensify the fight against extremists abroad, and whose budgetary and rhetorical priorities have indicated a military-first approach even as he has proposed cuts in diplomatic spending.\n\nTo some critics, that suggests that much more change is to come, in difficult situations in a roiled Middle East that have never had clear solutions.\n\nRobert Malley, a former senior official in the Obama administration and now vice president for policy at the International Crisis Group, said the uptick in military involvement since Mr. Trump took office did not appear to have been accompanied by increased planning for the day after potential military victories.\n\n“The military will be the first to tell you that a military operation is only as good as the diplomatic and political plan that comes with it,” Mr. Malley said.\n\nThe lack of diplomacy and planning for the future in places like Yemen and Syria could render victories there by the United States and its allies unsustainable.\n\n“From harsh experience, we know that either U.S. forces will have to be involved for the long term or victory will dissipate soon after they leave,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOthers fear that greater military involvement could drag the United States into murky wars and that increased civilian deaths could feed anti-Americanism and jihadist propaganda.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome insist that this has already happened.\n\n“Daesh is happy about the American attacks against civilians to prove its slogans that the Americans want to kill Muslims everywhere and not only the Islamic State’s gunmen,” a resident of the Syrian city of Raqqa wrote via WhatsApp, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. He gave only his first name, Abdul-Rahman, for fear of the jihadists.\n\nThe shift toward greater military involvement extends into one of Mr. Obama’s central legacies: the prolonged American presence in Afghanistan, where more than 8,400 American soldiers and 5,924 troops from NATO and other allies remain, and where the Taliban have been resurgent.\n\nPlans have been announced to send 300 United States Marines to Helmand Province, their first deployment there since 2014. And the American commander, Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., told Congress in February that he would like another “few thousand” American and coalition troops.\n\nBut the changes have also been notable in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, all home to overlapping conflicts in failed states where jihadist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have taken advantage of the chaos to step up operations.\n\nEven while being drawn more deeply into those conflicts, the Obama administration sought to limit American engagement while pushing — mostly in vain — for diplomatic solutions. It also launched frequent airstrikes to kill individual jihadists or to destroy their facilities and sent thousands of American troops back to Iraq to train and advise Iraqi forces, and also provide firepower, so they could “degrade and ultimately destroy” the Islamic State.\n\nBut under Mr. Obama, the White House often spent weeks or even months deliberating certain raids and airstrikes out of concern for American service members and civilians — and often to the frustration of commanders and American allies.\n\nMr. Trump’s tough statements before coming into office, and the rise in civilian deaths in recent American strikes, have raised questions about whether the new president has removed constraints from the Pentagon on how it wages war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut administration officials say that has not yet happened. And military officials insist that the streamlined process for airstrikes does not exempt commanders from strict protocols meant to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nSpeaking before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, General Votel said the Pentagon had not relaxed its rules of engagement. He called the mounting toll of civilian deaths in Iraq and Syria “absolutely tragic and heartbreaking” and said Central Command was investigating their cause.\n\nThe complexity of these wars and the American role in them is clear in Yemen, where the United States has two distinct roles, both of which have increased under Mr. Trump.\n\nThe country, the Arab world’s poorest, has been split in half since militants known as the Houthis allied with parts of the military and seized the capital, pushing the internationally recognized government into exile.\n\nTwo years ago, a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels, hoping to weaken them militarily and restore the government. They have made little progress, while more than 10,000 people have been killed and large parts of the country are on the verge of famine, according to the United Nations.\n\nUnder Mr. Obama, the United States provided military support to the Saudi-led coalition, but halted the sale of precision-guided munitions over concerns that airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and its allies were killing too many civilians.\n\nBut since Mr. Trump took office, his administration has advanced some arms deals for coalition countries, while approving the resumption of sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, according to an American official familiar with Yemen policy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Later, a Special Operations raid in late January led to the death of many civilians and an American commando.\n\nSo far this month, the United States has also launched more than 49 strikes across Yemen, most of them during one five-day period, according to data gathered by the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. That is more strikes than the United States had carried out during any other full year on record.\n\nSome analysts note that this military surge has not brought with it a clear strategy to end Yemen’s war or uproot Al Qaeda.\n\n“As the military line has surged, there has not been a surge in diplomacy,” said Katherine Zimmerman, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe United States faces a similarly complex set of overlapping conflicts in Syria, where a brutal civil war opened up opportunities for Al Qaeda to infiltrate the rebels seeking to topple the government while the Islamic State seized an area of territory that extended over the border into Iraq.\n\nWhile intervening covertly to support the rebels, the United States has ordered airstrikes on the jihadists — alone in the case of Al Qaeda and as part of a coalition against the Islamic State. It has also built ties with the Iraqi security forces, and with Kurdish and Arab fighters in Syria to battle the jihadists on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut recently, a string of airstrikes have exposed the United States to allegations of killing large numbers of civilians. More than 60 people were killed in a strike on a mosque complex where local residents said a religious gathering was taking place. The United States said it was targeting Qaeda leaders. The military has been accused of killing about 30 Syrians in an airstrike on a school, but has insisted that the early indications show it hit Islamic State fighters. A strike in Mosul killed scores of civilians, although the military is investigating whether militants herded the people into the building or possibly rigged it with bombs.\n\nThe rise in reports of civilian deaths linked to the United States and its allies has been so significant that Airwars, a group that tracks airstrikes, said last week that it was suspending its investigations into Russian airstrikes to avoid falling behind on those by the United States.\n\nAmerican officials have attributed the rising number of strikes and the danger to civilians to the urban battlefields in Mosul and Raqqa and the high concentration of civilians in areas held by the jihadists. They say they try to avoid civilian casualties while the Islamic State deliberately kills anybody who stands in its way.\n\nThis month, American officials also said they would send an additional 400 troops to Syria to help prepare for the assault on Raqqa, the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed capital, nearly doubling the total there.\n\nIn Iraq, General Votel said that in just the past 37 days, as the fight moved into the denser western side of Mosul, 284 of the Iraqi forces had been killed and 1,600 more wounded, underlining the ferocity of the battles.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/world/middleeast/us-war-footprint-grows-in-middle-east.html","1490760000.0"
"Big money is coming to bitcoin: ex-Fortress executive Novogratz\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Mike Novogratz, the former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group who has joined the mad dash for crypto-currencies, said on Monday that mainstream institutional investors are about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin.\n\nNovogratz said he expects major financial firms will soon start to offer bitcoin or similar products as an investment option, one that could be easily purchased over the phone.\n\nA turning-point product from a big financial firm could arrive within six months, he said, though he declined to name a specific company.\n\n“When it’s that easy, the price of bitcoin or ethereum is going to go much higher. And that is a lot closer than people think,” said Novogratz, who spoke at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York.\n\nNovogratz is now chief executive of Galaxy Investment Partners, a firm that bets on cryptocurrencies and related businesses.\n\n“The institutionalization of this space is coming. It’s coming pretty quick,” he said.\n\nFor the most part though, institutional investors have stayed away from bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the original and largest crypto-currency in terms of market capitalization, despite outperforming all the world's traditional currencies.\n\nTraditional investors still view bitcoin as opaque and highly speculative with potential to collapse even though so far this year bitcoin has soared nearly 580 percent.\n\nBitcoin surged on Monday to $6,487, recovering more than $1,000 after losing almost a third of its value in less than four days as traders bought back into the volatile cryptocurrency.\n\nIt hit a record peak last week just shy of $8,000.\n\nDuring the latest pullback over the weekend though, Novogratz said he bought $15 million to $20 million worth of bitcoins.\n\nEarly enthusiasts for the crypto-currency were drawn to its revolutionary ideals of transparency and a lack of central or official control. The risks of dealing in bitcoin were laid bare in 2013 when Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox collapsed after admitting it had lost the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of investor funds.\n\nThe currency’s earlier ties to gambling and criminal websites did not endear it to traditional investors.\n\nBut bitcoin has since overcome some of those challenges. “We’re past that,” he said.\n\nBIGGEST REGRET FOR 2017\n\nNovogratz’s biggest regret this year has been not buying more cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, when prices fell, because he knew that they would keep going up.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nEthereum is another public blockchain, essentially a shared database, similar to that of bitcoin. Ethereum’s token is called ether.\n\nHe felt that he made a psychological mistake, comparing the original price he paid to ethereum’s value over the summer. “When it was time to buy it back, I didn’t buy enough back,” he said.\n\nHe sees bitcoin, for instance, hitting $10,000 by March.\n\nThe former Fortress executive recently created his own crypto-hedge fund, putting in about $100 million of his own money. He hopes to raise about $500 million, making it the largest fund of its kind.\n\nNovogratz said Galaxy’s largest investment is in bitcoin. It has a “very big” holding of ethereum and about 30-35 different tokens and companies. He declined to give the percentages of each holding, citing competitive reasons.\n\nOne of those investments is in the token sale of Worldwide Asset Exchange, an online marketplace for so-called “skins,” which are essentially virtual accessories of video game characters. The total market for “skins” is $50 billion.\n\nThe skins don’t have much application except to change how a character or a weapon looks.\n\nHe is also an investor in FunFair, a decentralized gaming platform.\n\nFORTRESS EXIT\n\nNovogratz, a former Princeton University wrestler, U.S. Army helicopter pilot, and Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) partner, is best known as a swaggering “macro” investor in the mold of George Soros who made big wagers on global economic movements.\n\nNovogratz worked at Fortress from 2002 to 2015, where he was a principal and ran its macro hedge funds. They grew to manage billions of dollars and made “Novo” a Wall Street star. But the funds were shut in 2015 following investment losses. Novogratz retired from the firm.\n\n“Very few people have graceful exits from Wall Street. Mine wasn’t as graceful as I would have liked,” he told Reuters.\n\nAfter Fortress, Novogratz planned to focus running his own money and avoid the complications of external investors. But he fell in love with the promise of blockchain technology after successfully investing in bitcoin, ethereum and other assets.\n\nHe has quickly become one of the most prominent advocates of blockchain and has been working to convince larger, more conservative asset managers to get involved.\n\n“It’s potentially wildly disruptive and revolutionary,” Novogratz said.\n\nFor other news from Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit, see: here","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-summit-novogratz/big-money-is-coming-to-bitcoin-ex-fortress-executive-novogratz-idUSKBN1DD2RE","1510686439.0"
"So What Exactly Is In The Paris Climate Accord?\nSo What Exactly Is In The Paris Climate Accord?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Francois Mori/AP Francois Mori/AP\n\nEditor's Note: This story was originally published in December 2015 and was republished with minor updates ahead of President Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. Some of the information on approval by individual governments has been changed to reflect changes in status.\n\nRepresentatives from 196 parties made a historic pact on Dec. 12, 2015, in Paris to adopt green energy sources, cut down on climate change emissions and limit the rise of global temperatures — while also cooperating to cope with the impact of unavoidable climate change.\n\nThe agreement acknowledges that the threat of climate change is 'urgent and potentially irreversible,' and can only be addressed through 'the widest possible cooperation by all countries' and 'deep reductions in global emissions.'\n\nBut how deep will those reductions be — and how soon, and who's paying for it?\n\nHere are some key figures from the final agreement.\n\n2 Degrees\n\nThe central goal of the agreement is laid out in one phrase:\n\n'Holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels ...'\n\nLimiting the rise in temperature to 2 degrees (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) has been discussed as a global goal for several years now. That amount of warming will still have a substantial impact, scientists say, but will be less devastating than allowing temperatures to rise unchecked.\n\nThe global average temperature has already risen about 1 degree Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels.\n\nAnd even if every signatory country meets its current pledge for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the world is still expected to pass 2 degrees of warming, as the agreement itself notes with concern. (That section is literally labeled 'Notes with concern.')\n\nThe current emission targets are just a first step, in short, and the Paris signatories hope the world can figure out how to get closer to the 2-degree goal as time goes on.\n\n... Or 1.5 Degrees\n\nBut wait! There's more!\n\nThat same sentence in the deal continues: '... and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.'\n\nThat's right. The big, ambitious goal is immediately followed ... by a bigger, more ambitious goal.\n\nSmall island nations, in particular, fought hard to have this number appear in the agreement, noting that even if the temperature increase was held at 2 degrees, the resulting rise in sea levels would be devastating for them.\n\nIsland representatives adopted the oft-repeated motto, '1.5 to stay alive,' as NPR's Ari Shapiro has reported.\n\nAnd while those vulnerable nations didn't manage to establish 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) as the legally binding target, it is worked in as an aspiration. But it's a goal that would be even harder to achieve than 2 degrees — which, again, is a target the world hasn't yet figured out how to meet.\n\n$100 Billion\n\n'To help developing countries switch from fossil fuels to greener sources of energy and adapt to the effects of climate change, the developed world will provide $100 billion a year,' NPR's Christopher Joyce reports.\n\nBut that amount is identified as a 'floor,' not a ceiling.\n\n'Developed countries won inclusion of language that would up the ante in subsequent years,' he explains, 'so that financial aid will keep ramping up over time.'\n\n'As Soon As Possible'\n\nThis one isn't exactly a number ... but it's the target time for 'global peaking' of climate change emissions.\n\nIt's an acknowledgement that in the near future, total emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases won't fall — in fact, they'll rise, as developing economies consume more energy.\n\nBut the plan assumes that greener technology, conservation efforts and processes to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will eventually allow emissions to decline instead of rise — and at that point, the 'peak' will be achieved.\n\n2020\n\nNations aren't expected to ratchet their emissions back immediately.\n\n'Each country came to Paris with a voluntary pledge to reduce emissions,' Christopher says. 'The agreement now codifies that and sets a framework for those reductions to begin in 2020.'\n\nThat year is also the deadline for countries to submit a more long-term plan — not an immediate pledge, like their current goals, but one looking decades into the future.\n\n5 Years\n\nAfter the 2020 reductions kick in, it's not over: The deal is designed to evolve as the years pass. Every five years, specifically, each nation's targets will be reevaluated to move the world closer to the 2-degree target.\n\nThis element of the deal was one strongly supported by then-President Barack Obama, and it's highlighted in a White House fact sheet:\n\n'Targets must be submitted 9-12 months before they are finalized, creating time for other countries and civil society to seek clarity about the targets submitted,' the Obama administration wrote.\n\n'Each target should reflect progress from the prior one, reflecting the highest possible ambition that each country can achieve. This durable, long term framework will drive greater climate ambition as technologies improve and circumstances change.'\n\n2050(ish)\n\nThis target date isn't actually precise: The deal describes it as 'mid-century.'\n\nBut that's when the world is supposed to meet another goal, which is much more concrete:\n\n0\n\nZero, as in net zero emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nNo one expects that over the next 40 years, the world would entirely stop using every form of technology that releases greenhouse gases. Instead, as Christopher Joyce explains, the mid-century target would be met by balancing inputs and outputs:\n\n'Any greenhouse gases emitted would be balanced or zeroed out by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. In the case of carbon dioxide, that would presumably be accomplished by growing forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.'\n\n???\n\nDiplomacy isn't always quantifiable. Many sections of the deal, of course, don't nail down any numbers at all.\n\nFor instance, nations around the world 'should strengthen their cooperation on enhancing action on adaptation' to the effects of climate change, the agreement states.\n\n'All Parties should cooperate to enhance the capacity of develop country Parties to implement this agreement,' it says elsewhere. And 'Parties shall cooperate in taking measures, as appropriate, to enhance climate change education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information.'\n\n55 Countries, 55 Percent\n\nA total of 196 parties committed to the climate deal in 2015 and had a deadline of April 21, 2017, to officially sign on to the agreement.\n\nAt least 55 nations — between them accounting for at least 55 percent of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions — needed to formally approve the pact before it went into effect. That threshold was reached on Oct. 5, 2016, and the accord kicked in 30 days later.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/01/531048986/so-what-exactly-is-in-the-paris-climate-accord","1496289600.0"

"5 killed in California shooting rampage, including gunman's wife\nThe death toll in a shooting rampage in northern California rose to five today as authorities gave chilling new insight into the suspected killer's apparently random attack.\n\nAuthorities say the gunman's wife -- whose killing appeared to have kicked off the shooting spree -- was found dead under the floor at their home Tuesday night. Authorities say they suspect she was killed Monday night, sparking suspected gunman Kevin Neal's seemingly random Tuesday morning shooting spree at multiple locations, including an elementary school.\n\nNo children were killed in the shootings, which took place about 130 miles north of Sacramento. But seven children were among those wounded, authorities said, with injuries ranging from very minor to life-threatening.\n\nThe suspected gunman was killed by police.\n\nTehama County Sheriff via AP\n\nAuthorities said law enforcement had a history with Neal and said he was out on bail for an assault with a deadly weapon arrest from January.\n\nHere's what we know about how the rampage unfolded, according to authorities:\n\n-- Neal's wife was found dead from several gunshot wounds on Tuesday night, said Phil Johnston, Tehama County assistant sheriff, but Johnston said she was probably shot late Monday. Her body was found covered up under the floor, he said. Johnston said it appears that's what started the shooting spree.\n\n-- The first call for the Tuesday shootings came in at 7:54 a.m. PT. Authorities said random shots were fired into residences.\n\n-- The suspect then engaged a citizen who followed him before allegedly stealing the citizen's car, police said.\n\n--The gunman 'arbitrarily' shot at residents in the rural area as he drove by, said Johnston.\n\nElijah Nouvelage/AFP/Getty Images\n\n-- Shortly after, the gunman engaged with a woman who was taking her two children to school. He allegedly opened fire on them at an intersection, authorities said.

"German parliament foiled cyber attack by hackers via Israeli website\nBERLIN (Reuters) - The German parliament was the target of fresh cyber attacks in January that attempted to piggy-back on an Israeli newspaper site to target politicians in Germany, Berlin’s cyber security watchdog said on Wednesday.\n\nA man types on a computer keyboard in Warsaw in this February 28, 2013 illustration file picture. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Files\n\nCyber defenses installed after a 2015 hack of the parliament helped avert the attempted breaches, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said in a statement.\n\nThe hackers appeared to use advertising running on the Jerusalem Post website to redirect users to a malicious site, it said.\n\nThe BSI looked into unusual activity on the parliament’s network early this year and has just completed a detailed analysis of the incident, which was first reported by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Wednesday.\n\nAt least 10 German lawmakers from all parliamentary groups were affected by the attempted hack, the Munich daily reported.\n\n“The technical analysis is complete. The website of the Jerusalem Post was manipulated and had been linked to a malicious third party site,” the agency said in a statement.\n\n“BSI found no malware or infections as part of its analysis of the Bundestag networks.”\n\nThe Jerusalem Post confirmed details of the attack with Reuters, but said no malware came from its own site and that it was fully protected against such attacks in the future.\n\n“The Jerusalem Post website was attacked in January by foreign hackers,” the publisher said in a statement. “We immediately took action and together with Israeli cyber authorities successfully neutralized the threat.\n\nHackers can use infected banner advertisements to attack otherwise safe or secure sites. So-called “malvertising” appeared to be served up to the site via an unidentified third-party advertising network.\n\nThere was no suggestion from the German agency of any wrongdoing by the Jerusalem Post.\n\n“SPEAR-PHISHING”\n\nSecurity expert Graham Cluley said such “spear-phishing” attacks via malicious ads is highly unusual, but possible.\n\nIn this instance, the Jerusalem Post site could have served up German language ads to visitors with German internet addresses. However, he said it was unlikely this could be used to target specific politicians in Berlin.\n\nThis latest attack comes amid growing concern in Germany about cyber security and reports that Russia is working to destabilize the German government and could seek to interfere in the upcoming Sept. 24 national elections.\n\nThe Bundestag lost 16 gigabytes of data to Russian hackers in 2015, after which it revamped its software system with the help of the BSI and private contractors.\n\n“The BSI believes that the defenses of the German Bundestag detected and prevented links to the website. The attack was therefore averted,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement.\n\nA source familiar with the incident said it did not appear to be linked to APT28, a Russian hacking group also known as “Fancy Bear” that was blamed for the 2015 Bundestag hack and the 2016 hack of the U.S. Democratic National Committee.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-cyber/german-parliament-foiled-cyber-attack-by-hackers-via-israeli-website-idUSKBN1701V3","1490794974.0"
"Catalonia referendum: What just happened?\n(CNN) Spain is facing political turmoil this week following a contested independence referendum in the region of Catalonia, which descended into violence and left hundreds injured.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nMore than 2.25 million people turned out to Sunday's referendum across Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain. The regional government said 90% of voters were in favor of a split from Madrid.\n\nBut the turnout was low -- around 42% of the voter roll. Catalan authorities blamed the figure on the crackdown on the vote initiated by the national government.\n\nSpain's highest court had ruled the vote illegal under the Spanish constitution. Citing the judicial authority, Madrid flooded Catalonia with thousands of national police in advance of the vote . Officers seized millions of ballot papers and sealed schools and other buildings to be used as polling stations.\n\nOn Sunday, the day of the disputed vote, national police launched a concerted effort to prevent people from casting their ballots. Police fired rubber bullets at protesters and voters trying to take part in the referendum, and used batons to beat them back.\n\nPeople help a man injured by a rubber bullet fired by Spanish police officers outside the Ramon Llull polling station in Barcelona.\n\nPolice smashed their way into polling stations, and were seen pulling voters out by the hair and restraining elderly people.\n\nThe scenes shocked Catalans and reverberated around Europe.\n\nAlmost 900 people were injured, Catalan officials said. Opposition parties criticized Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for taking a heavy-handed approach to blocking the vote.\n\nWhy did it happen?\n\nThe long-running dispute goes back to the brutal years under Franco, whose dictatorial regime repressed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy. In 1979, four years after his death, the region was granted greater autonomy.\n\nIn 2006, the Spanish government backed Catalonia's calls for even greater powers and financial control of the region, granting it 'nation' status.\n\nPhotos: Divisions in Spain over Catalonia crisis Protesters march through Barcelona during a demonstration to support the unity of Spain on October 8.

Catalonia is the wealthiest region in Spain and is industrially more advanced than the rest of the country.\n\nThe region held a symbolic poll in 2014, in which 80% of voters backed complete secession -- but only 32% of the electorate turned out.\n\nWas the vote legitimate?\n\nMadrid insists the vote was illegal. Prime Minister Rajoy said on Sunday that it 'didn't happen.'\n\nJUST WATCHED Police clash with Catalonia referendum voters Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police clash with Catalonia referendum voters 02:35\n\nThe national government argues that Spain's Constitution, revised in 1978, says that all Spaniards have the right to vote in referenda on major issues, so any vote on secession must be put to all Spaniards. Less than half of the regions 5 million voters appear to have taken part in the referendum.\n\nThe European Commission wrote on Twitter that the vote was not legal.\n\nThere are several other complications with the vote. Because Madrid declared the vote illegal, many Catalans who might have turned out to an independence referendum chose not to.\n\nImages of the use of force by police also suggest that many voters were physically prevented from casting their ballots, or felt intimated to do so.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe world is now waiting to see if Catalan officials will unilaterally declare independence. Authorities had earlier threatened to make the declaration within 48 hours of the vote if secession won.\n\nBut on Monday, the Catalan President stopped short of such a declaration, calling for international mediation instead.\n\nMadrid has the option of seizing control of Catalonia's administration by triggering article 155 of the Constitution . It could use this time to call a snap election and negotiate with new Catalan leaders.\n\nBut this is a major risk for the Spanish government. Like the use of force on Sunday, such a measure would likely fuel resentment for Madrid among Catalan independence supporters and create more political turmoil.\n\nThere is more at stake for Madrid than losing its wealthiest region. The country has 17 regions with varying degrees of autonomy, and losing one may inspire other regions to begin, or revive, separatist movements.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/02/europe/catalonia-independence-referendum-explainer/index.html","1506916800.0"
"Indian Prime Minister blames Rohingya violence on extremists\nNew Delhi (CNN) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Myanmar is threatening to be overshadowed by the escalating humanitarian crisis in the south of the country, as tens of thousands of ethnic Rohingya flee into Bangladesh to escape violence in Rakhine state.\n\nIn a joint statement issued by Modi and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday, the two leaders promised to work together to solve what they termed 'a terrorist problem.'\n\n'We would like to thank India for its strong stance with regard to the terrorist threat that came to our country a couple of weeks ago,' said Suu Kyi.\n\nMyanmar officials have long maintained that violence in Rakhine is the result of ongoing terrorist activity and any subsequent security clampdowns are a necessary measure to protect innocent Burmese. According to the country's state media, the latest wave of unrest was sparked when Rohingya militants killed 12 security officers in border post attacks on August 25.\n\n'We believe that together we can work to make sure that terrorism is not allowed to take root on our soil or on the soil in any neighboring countries,' added Suu Kyi.\n\nModi, who is in Mynamar as part of a two-day bilateral visit, supported Suu Kyi's statement, attributing the violence of the last few weeks to extremists. 'We share your concerns about the extremist violence in the Rakhine state and especially the violence against the security forces and how innocent lives have been affected and killed.'\n\nAn estimated 146,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh in recent days, according to the United Nations. Many of those crossing the border have brought with them stories of widespread devastation and murder , as the Myanmar security forces deploy alleged scorched earth tactics in the hunt for militants.\n\nRegional issue\n\nAs the conflict in Rakhine intensifies, many of Myanmar's Muslim-majority neighbors have called on the government to halt the ongoing violence and better protect those fleeing.\n\nIndia, which is home to one of the largest concentrations of Rohingya outside Bangladesh, has a vested interest in preventing the violence and stemming the influx of refugees, but geopolitical considerations have so far kept it from speaking out, say analysts.\n\n'The Modi government has been trying to push its Act East policy and to build a kind of community around the Bay of Bengal, where Myanmar is a key player,' said K. Yhome, a senior fellow at India's Observer Research Foundation.\n\nIndia views Myanmar as a useful ally in the country's longstanding rivalry with China, as the two countries vie for regional power. 'The (Indian) government is not wanting to push the Myanmar regime towards the other side,' added Yhome.\n\nDomestic considerations have also played into India's relatively muted diplomatic response. On Tuesday, as Modi prepared to touch down in Myanmar, a junior minister in India's Home Ministry, Kiren Rijiju, told local media that 'whether the Rohingyas are registered under the United Nations Human Rights Commission or not, they are illegal immigrants in India ... as per law, they stand to be deported.'\n\nRijiu's comments follow growing concern within India at the increasing numbers of Rohingya seeking asylum in the country. In April, senior members of the government met to discuss possible mechanisms for the 'detection, arrest and deportation' of Rohingya.\n\nIt's not clear whether India is in a position to deport its Rohingya population to Myanmar or Bangladesh. In a statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said they have not received any official communication from the Indian government with regard to its plans on Rohingya, and there are currently no reported instances of deportations of registered Rohingya refugees.\n\nIllegal immigrants\n\nAfter a short period living in a Bangladeshi refugee camp, Rohingya refugee Nezamudden traveled overland to Delhi in 2013 in search of security. Yet, five years on, he finds that security more fragile than ever. 'We are very scared of our deportation,' he told CNN.\n\nThe words from the central government against Rohingya have added fuel to the discrimination he says he faces on a daily basis from his Delhi landlord and neighbors.\n\n'They're saying, 'you Muslims are terrorists. You're fighting against your own government. You're bad people,'' said Nezamudden. 'They say this everyday.'\n\nJUST WATCHED Rohingya Muslims flee violence in Myanmar Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rohingya Muslims flee violence in Myanmar 02:33\n\nThe Indian government says there are around 40,000 Rohingya currently in the country, though that number is contested by the UNHCR, who puts the number closer to 16,500.\n\nThe notion that Rohingya are 'illegal immigrants' is at least in part perpetuated by the group's semi-legal status in India, itself a product of the country's lack of legal framework around refugees.\n\nGuidelines issued by the the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs allow local immigration offices to dispense long-term visas to refugees, but only on a case-by-case basis.\n\nLawyers representing the Rohingya in India are now attempting to challenge this ruling, arguing that India's Supreme Court has accepted international law in previous rulings on refugees.\n\n'International law is often incorporated into the judgments of the Supreme Court,' said Colin Gonsalves, a lawyer representing Rohingya refugees in a petition in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. 'The general principle regarding refugees is that a refugee will not be returned to a country where he is likely to face harm or death or be persecuted again.'\n\nIn the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, where some 7,000 Rohingya have settled, lawyer Hunar Gupta has filed a petition to remove Rohingya, alleging that 'they are suspected of being involved in various anti-national activities such as drug trafficking.'\n\nGupta also claims that 'there will be an increase in pro-separatists as well as anti-Indian activities in the state of Jammu and Kashmir,' as a result of the influx of 'illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar.'\n\nIndia, though not a signatory to the 1951 UN refugee convention, has historically prided itself on its openness to refugees. An estimated eight million refugees were granted asylum in 1947 in the wake of Partition, with the largest refugee camp being set up northwest of Delhi.\n\nThere, the government accommodated some 300,000 people fleeing from what was then West Punjab, providing '100 tons of flour daily, along with large quantities of salt, rice, lentils, sugar and cooking oil,' according to historian Ramachandra Guha. The government even provided entertainment, showing classic Disney films featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.\n\nAbout a decade later, India opened its doors again, this time to Tibetans feeling Chinese persecution. And in 1971, when Bangladesh split from Pakistan to become its own country, India once again took in refugees fleeing from violence.\n\n'This notion that there's an absence of a legal framework to take in refugees, this is nothing more than a sheer fig leaf,' said Sumit Ganguly, a professor of political science at Indiana University.\n\nThe real intentions, he said, are rooted in anti-Muslim ideas.\n\n'The use of a broad brush to suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is the most absurd proposition,' he added. 'They're simply using the terrorist bogey in India to justify a policy based in prejudice and hatred.'","https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/06/asia/modi-india-myanmar-rohingya/index.html","1504670400.0"

This means there are few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services.\n\nAlthough so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its 'soldiers' had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act.

"Strangers buy car for 20-year-old Texas man who walks 3 miles to work every day\nWhen Andy Mitchell spotted a young man in a fast food uniform walking along the side of a road on a 95-degree summer day in Rockwall, Texas, he felt compelled to pull over.\n\nHe rolled down his window and offered the man, a 20-year-old named Justin Korva, a ride -- not knowing how much that small gesture would impact the man's life.\n\nWhile driving the Korva to work at Taco Casa, Mitchell discovered the young man normally walked 3 miles to work and home again every day. Korva said he was determined to save up money and someday, he hoped, he would be able to afford a car.\n\nAfter dropping off Korva, Mitchell posted about the man's determination on Facebook.\n\n'To all the people that say they want to work but can't find a job or don't have a vehicle all I can say is you don't want it bad enough,' Mitchell wrote.\n\nFacebook/Andy Mitchell\n\nHundreds of people in the community saw his post, including Samee Dowlatshahi, owner of Samee's Pizza Getti Italian Bistro & Lounge in Rockwell.\n\nDowlatshahi offered to put a donation box inside his pizza joint to aid Korva in his quest to buy a car.\n\nIn less than 48 hours, with some help from Mitchell, they'd raised more than $5,500.\n\nThat's when Danny Rawls, general sales manager at Toyota of Rockwall and a friend of Dowlatshahi, heard Korva's inspiring story.\n\n'I presented it to my general manager and said, 'Hey, let's help the kid. It seems like a great story,'' Rawls told CBS News.\n\nHis boss agreed, and the pair reduced the price on a 2004 Toyota Camry that was available.\n\n'I sent [Dowlatshahi] a private message and said, 'Give me a call. I have a nice car that would work for the kid,'' Rawls explained.\n\nNot only did they have enough money to buy the car, they had enough left over to pay for his insurance for a year, plus two years' worth of oil changes and a $500 gas card.\n\nLast Friday, they drove the white 2004 Camry to Taco Casa and asked Korva to come outside.\n\n'Justin, you can't imagine all the people who wanted to help you,' Mitchell said, as several people filmed the exchange on their cellphones in the restaurant parking lot. 'So, instead of walking to work, buddy, you're driving this car from now on.'\n\nKorva looked at Mitchell in disbelief, 'Are you serious?'\n\n'It's your car! This is your car,' Mitchell repeated.\n\nFacebook\n\nKorva gave each man a hug, wiping tears from his eyes as he walked toward the car.\n\n'We just want you to know, seriously, this community, nothing we love better than to have someone who works hard,' Dowlatshahi said.

"Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock was a high-stakes gambler who 'kept to himself' before massacre\nORLANDO — He liked to bet big, wagering tens of thousands of dollars in a sitting. He owned homes in four states but preferred staying in casino hotels, sometimes for weeks at a time, as he worked the gambling machines.\n\nHe grew up the son of a convicted bank robber who was constantly running from the law. But in his own life, Stephen Paddock, 64, had stayed out of trouble until Sunday night, when he suddenly unleashed a firestorm of bullets from his casino hotel room, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500 more on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\n“If you told me an asteroid fell into Earth, it would mean the same to me. There’s absolutely no sense, no reason he did this,” his brother Eric Paddock said in an interview outside his home in Orlando. “He’s just a guy who played video poker and took cruises and ate burritos at Taco Bell. There’s no political affiliation that we know of. There’s no religious affiliation that we know of.”\n\nAfter the shooting, officers found Stephen Paddock dead with 23 guns on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where he had arrived Thursday. Police believe Paddock acted alone in executing the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\n[How the Las Vegas Strip shooting unfolded]\n\nEric Paddock said he knew of five guns his brother kept in his safe but was shocked that a rapid-fire weapon was used in Sunday’s shooting. He said Stephen Paddock didn’t hunt and barely shot his guns, once taking Eric’s children on a skeet-shooting trip paid for by the casinos.\n\nPolice said they found 19 firearms at Stephen Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nev.\n\nIn the final years of his life, Stephen Paddock was living out his retirement in quiet obscurity. He liked country music, relatives said, and went to concerts like the Route 91 Harvest festival where he killed so many Sunday night.\n\nHe was worth more than $2 million, relatives said. Before retiring, he made a small fortune from real estate deals and a business that he and Eric Paddock sold off. He traveled a lot and had millions of free airline miles.\n\nAt various points of his life, Stephen Paddock worked for defense contractor Lockheed Martin and as an accountant and property manager. As a retiree, he had no children and plenty of money to play with. So he took up gambling.\n\n“It’s like a job for him. It’s a job where you make money,” said Eric Paddock, adding that his brother could lose $1 million and still have enough to live on. “He was at the hotel for four months one time. It was like a second home.”\n\nHe recalled one time when the entire family took over the top floor of the Atlantis at the casino’s expense.\n\nHis brother was very particular about the games he played. “It had to be the right machine with double points, and there has to be a contest going on. He won a car one time,” Eric Paddock said.\n\n“He’s known. He’s a top player. He’s the small end of the big fish.”\n\n[Route 91 Harvest Festival: The Las Vegas ‘sleepover’ that ended in a nightmare]\n\nOver the past two decades, Stephen Paddock bought and lived in properties in several states, including California, Nevada, Florida and Texas, where for a time, neighbors said he lived with his mother. Public records show Paddock owned two planes and was a licensed pilot. He also had a fishing license from Alaska.\n\nHe told neighbors he was a professional gambler and a prospector, and he appeared to favor buying homes in retirement communities. At one point, he and his longtime girlfriend, Marilou Danley, were living in at least three retirement communities, property records show. Neighbors said the couple seemed almost itinerant, leaving the properties empty for long stretches as Paddock visited his casinos.\n\nDonald Judy, who was his next-door neighbor in Florida until two years ago, said the inside of Paddock’s home “looked like a college freshman lived there.” There was no art on the walls and no car in the driveway. Just a dining chair, a bed and two recliners. Paddock was constantly on the move, carrying a suitcase and driving a rental car whenever he stayed at the community near Cocoa Beach.\n\n“It looked like he’d be ready to move at a moment’s notice,” Judy said.\n\nJudy said he never flashed his wealth, often wearing khaki cotton pants, with a polo or other collared shirt, and never driving anything nicer than a standard rental car.\n\nA little while after living there, Paddock left Judy a key and asked him to keep an eye on the rarely used house and to borrow any tools he might want. Judy said there were no drugs or parties, nothing unusual except for Paddock’s gambling.\n\n“They did seem to always stay up till midnight and sleep in till noon,” Judy said. “They always seemed to stay on Vegas time.”\n\n[America’s deadliest shooting incidents are getting much more deadly]\n\nThen, as quickly as he had appeared, Paddock put up a for-sale sign, Judy said. “He never said much about it, just said they were moving back to Vegas.”\n\nCalifornia records show that Paddock married a woman named Peggy Okamoto in 1985. They divorced in 1990 citing “irreconcilable differences.” In recent years, Danley had become his girlfriend, relatives said.\n\nAuthorities said Danley was out of the country at the time of the shooting and was located in Tokyo. She is not considered a suspect.\n\nAt one point, Danley worked as a high-limit hostess for Club Paradise, a rewards program in the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, Nev., according to her LinkedIn profile. In a statement, Atlantis officials said she has not worked for the casino for several years.\n\nDiane McKay lived next door to Paddock and Danley at their Reno home until July, when McKay moved away. Danley wasn’t forthcoming about her life, and Paddock was unfriendly, McKay recalled. She only saw him in the mornings, when he went to the clubhouse to work out.\n\n“He was weird. Kept to himself,” said McKay, 79. “It was like living next to nothing. . . . You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet.”\n\nThe couple kept their blinds closed, but sometimes Paddock would open the garage door, revealing an enormous safe the size of a refrigerator.\n\n1 of 24 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The scene after a gunman opened fire on concertgoers at a country music festival in Las Vegas View Photos A man in a high-rise hotel opened fire on concertgoers on the Las Vegas Strip late Sunday, killing at least 50 people and injuring more than 200.

Eric, eight years his junior, was the youngest, with two in between: Bruce and Patrick.\n\nTheir father died a few years ago, but Eric Paddock grew up thinking their father was already dead. He found out otherwise when Patrick went to the Air Force Academy and was told his father was a decorated veteran and still alive.\n\n“We didn’t grow up under his influence,” Eric Paddock said. “I was born on the run in Tucson. My dad was about to be arrested for robbing banks.”\n\nFBI agents interviewed relatives Monday, including Paddock’s mother, who is close to 90 and spoke with him two weeks ago, Eric said. Five days after Hurricane Irma hit Orlando, Paddock texted his brother to see whether relatives had been affected.\n\nEric said he did not know of any mental illness, alcohol or drug problems in his brother’s life. He said he had no clue whether Stephen had gambling debts or was financially troubled.\n\nBy Monday night, after an entire day dealing with FBI investigators and reporters camped outside his house, Eric said he and other relatives were still struggling to process the atrocity carried out by his brother.\n\n“When we talked about a month ago, I can’t believe he was planning this,” he said, squeezing his eyes closed. “But he must have. It takes time.”\n\nWhat he knows about his brother doesn’t fit with Sunday’s massacre of innocents.\n\n“Something broke in his head is the only thing possible. Did he have a stroke?” he said. I’m hoping they cut open his brain and find something. There’s a data point missing.”\n\nJulie Tate and Mark Berman in Washington; Ally Gravina in Reno, Nev.; Heather Long in Mesquite, Nev.; William Dauber in Los Angeles; and Justin Glawe in Dallas contributed to this report.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/10/02/las-vegas-gunman-liked-to-gamble-listened-to-country-music-lived-quiet-retired-life-before-massacre/","1506916800.0"
"Rep. John Conyers announces retirement, endorses son to run for seat\nEmbattled Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, has announced Tuesday that he is retiring and has endorsed his son, John Conyers III to run for his seat. Conyers' lawyer confirmed that the retirement is effective immediately.\n\n'My legacy can't be compromised or diminished in any way by what we're going through now. This too shall pass,' said Conyers on a local Michigan radio station Tuesday morning.\n\nHe added, 'I want you to know that my legacy will continue through my children. I have a great family here and especially in my oldest boy, John Conyers III who incidentally I endorsed to replace me in my seat in Congress.'\n\nShortly after the announcement, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, took to the House floor to read a statement from Conyers. She said he asked her to read his statement announcing his decision and that he's notified House Speaker Paul Ryan, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder of his plans to step down.\n\n'Given the totality of the circumstance of not being afforded the right of due process in conjunction with current health conditions, and to preserve my legacy and good name, I am retiring. I hope my retirement will be viewed in the larger perspective of my record of service as I enter a new chapter,' the statement from Conyers read.\n\nCBS News obtained his retirement letter address to Speaker Ryan and Pelosi later Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWhile Conyers maintains he would be retiring immediately, CBS News' Steve Chaggaris reports that Conyers' resignation from the House will trigger a special election to replace him to be called by the governor, per Michigan law. That will take place as soon as the Michigan governor's office receives his letter of resignation.\n\nAccording to Speaker Ryan's office, nothing has been received notifying Ryan of his resignation. His resignation will not be effective until the office receives the original letter announcing the resignation and a copy of his signed letter to Governor Snyder.\n\nThe news comes after Conyers' great-nephew, 29-year old Michigan state Senator Ian Conyers, told CBS News' Jonathan Blakely he would be running for the elder Conyers' seat.\n\nAccording to a phone interview with The New York Times, the state senator was adamant that the elder Conyers was not resigning, but retiring instead. The 88-year-old Democrat is the longest-serving current House member.\n\n'His doctor advised him that the rigor of another campaign would be too much for him just in terms of his health,' Ian Conyers told the Times.\n\nHe added that he believed his great-uncle's constituents in Michigan would continue to support him and the rest of the family 'as we continue to fight, as we have for leading up to a century.'\n\nThe move comes amid numerous calls, including from Democratic leadership, for Conyers to step down in light of allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment against him.\n\nBuzzFeed was the first news outlet to report last week about a settlement Conyers made with a former staffer who had accused him of sexual misconduct. Conyers eventually acknowledged the settlement, but denied wrongdoing. Another former staff member accused Conyers of sexual misconduct and filed a lawsuit, but dropped the suit when the court refused to seal the case.\n\nSpeaking on the Mildred Gaddis radio show, Conyers said he's taking the allegations 'in stride.'\n\n'This goes with the issue of politics. The game of politics which we're in, we take what happens, we deal with it, we pass on and move on forward as we keep going trying to make as much as we can of this tremendous opportunity that's been given to me for so long,' said Conyers on Tuesday.\n\nIan Conyers did not go into detail with the Times on the allegations against his family member, but said he would stand with him.\n\n'I stand with my uncle in terms of his belief of no specific wrongdoing,' he said. 'However, those things need to have their day in court.'\n\nThe elder Conyers, however, continued to deny the allegations leveled against him.\n\n'Whatever they are they are not accurate, they are not true, and I think that they are something that I can't explain where they came from,' said Rep. Conyers.\n\nFollowing news of the allegations, Conyers was hospitalized in Detroit for a stress-related illness, according to his lawyer Arnold Reed.\n\nThe revelations against Conyers came amid a flurry of allegations of sexual misconduct against several of his colleagues in both the House and Senate, including Reps. Joe Barton, R-Texas, Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, and Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota.\n\nWhen asked if Congress should disclose the details of settlements made by other lawmakers in cases of sexual misconduct or harassment, Conyers replied with 'a strong, unequivocal yes.'\n\n'I think there should be a complete disclosure and revealing to all of the citizens of the country of what your federal legislators are doing or not doing and any cost that may have been incurred as a result of that,' added Conyers.\n\nConyers has already stepped down from his leadership position as ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee late last month. He will now be leaving the seat he's held since 1965.\n\nCBS News' Rebecca Kaplan and Catherine Reynolds contributed to this report.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rep-john-conyers-son-john-conyers-iii-to-run-for-congress-seat/","None"
"Prince Mohammed bin Salman Aims to Rebrand Saudi Arabia\nAnd while Salman, 32, is trying to reshape the way the world sees his country, Saudi Arabia continues to face questions over the treatment of its own people, with dozens of human rights defenders in prison for pushing for reform.\n\n'Too much destruction'\n\nSalman's bet is that reducing Saudi dependence on oil and transforming the economy will fulfill the needs and desires of his young population, outweighing the views of a powerful clerical class long wary of modernization.\n\nAnd he doesn't have a lot of time — the absolute monarchy urgently needs to create jobs and forestall the sorts of complaints that fed the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings throughout the region.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Hamad I Mohammed / Reuters file\n\nGhadi Al Harbi from Medina, home of one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Islam, is one of the young people that Salman needs on his side. And she knows where she stands on the issue of radicalization — the government must crack down.\n\n“We’ve suffered so much and so many innocent people have died for no reason,” said the 19-year-old English student, referring to religious divisions within Saudi society brought on by differing interpretations of Islam.\n\nShe said she had seen the effects of extremism firsthand, and knew people who had killed family members they branded infidels.\n\n“If this ideology persists, there will be too much destruction,” Al Harbi said.\n\nAn older brother Anwar Al Harbi, 34, sat close by, and he agreed that the government was heading in the right direction in allowing women to drive and opening the economy to the world.\n\nSalman was “talking the talk, walking the walk,” said Anwar Al Harbi, who works with the government's nationwide traffic control system.\n\nGhadi Al Harbi, center, and Anwar Al Harbi, second-from-right, sit with other family members in a popular park overlooking ancient Diriyah on the outskirts of Riyadh.

People are scared of the implications when it comes to what is after energy,' he said, referring to the country's dependence on oil.\n\nWith that, the two Al Harbis touched on the huge risks and opportunities inherent in Salman's sweeping plans to transform the Middle East’s largest economy, and one of the world’s most conservative and insular societies.\n\nSocial change\n\nSalman’s comments on Islam came during a rare public foray at a high-level business and finance conference in Riyadh, underlining the fact that widespread economic changes are going hand-in-hand with sweeping social ones.\n\n'We are returning to what we were before — a country of moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world,” he said on Oct. 24 before some 3,500 delegates from around the world.

We will destroy them today.”\n\n'Dashed hopes are a big machine for revolutions' 'Dashed hopes are a big machine for revolutions'\n\nWhile his pronouncements on Islam and radicalization made headlines, business and finance was the order of the day during the three-day Future Investment Initiative conference — dubbed 'Davos in the desert.”\n\nAmong the panelists were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock.\n\n“The guest list is a big deal,” said Eugene Rogan, a professor of Middle Eastern history at Oxford University who was in Riyadh at the same time as the conference. “When I look at who came they really were pulling in some of the heavy hitters of the global economy, and if they’re coming to Saudi Arabia it’s because they think they can make a buck here.”\n\n'Transformation' is a mantra that follows Salman around.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, right, meets with British businessman Richard Branson on Oct. 26.

At the same time, the state aims to get many more Saudis into private sector jobs — including women, who have long been underrepresented in the highly gender-segregated society — and reduce its dependence on foreign workers.\n\nSalman, who displaced his older cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince in June, is on a quest to show the world that Saudi Arabia is not a backward nation hamstrung by a backward beliefs.\n\nRiyadh's King Abdullah financial district sits on the horizon.

"Sikh community asks for hate-crime probe after man is told ‘go back to your own country’ and shot\nA gunman shot a Sikh man standing in his driveway in Kent, Wash., on Friday, March 3.

"'I'm The Only One That Matters,' Trump Says Of State Dept. Job Vacancies\n'I'm The Only One That Matters,' Trump Says Of State Dept. Job Vacancies\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nPresident Trump says: 'I'm the only one that matters' in setting U.S. foreign policy, thus downplaying the importance of high-level jobs such as the assistant secretary of state, which is currently vacant.\n\n'Let me tell you, the one that matters is me,' Trump said in an interview that aired on Fox News on Thursday night. 'I'm the only one that matters, because when it comes to it, that's what the policy is going to be. You've seen that, you've seen it strongly.'\n\nThe president was responding to a question from Fox's Laura Ingraham, who asked him, 'Are you worried that the State Department doesn't have enough Donald Trump nominees in there to push your vision through?'\n\nIngraham added, 'other State Departments, including Reagan's, at times, undermined his agenda. And there is a concern that the State Department currently is undermining your agenda.'\n\nTrump said, 'So, we don't need all the people that they want. You know, don't forget, I'm a businessperson. I tell my people, 'Where you don't need to fill slots, don't fill them.' But we have some people that I'm not happy with their thinking process.'\n\nTrump also briefly blamed Democrats for obstructing his nominees in the Republican-controlled Senate. He then said, 'We don't need all of the people. You know, it's called cost-saving.'\n\nThe president's remarks on his diplomatic corps came as he prepares to leave Washington for a five-nation trip to Asia, including stops in South Korea and China.\n\nIn August, concerns were raised that key East Asia jobs had been left empty as tensions rose between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump has not nominated an ambassador to South Korea.\n\nFor months, Trump's administration has been criticized over budget cuts to the State Department and its pace of nominations for high-profile ambassadorships in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nAs NPR's Michele Kelemen reported in September, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson 'has raised a lot of eyebrows, maintaining a hiring freeze long after it was lifted for the rest of the federal government. Secretary Tillerson has also hired outside consulting groups.'\n\nFor Trump, the approach extends beyond the State Department. His recent remarks echo what he said in October, when he told Forbes, 'I'm generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be — because you don't need them.'\n\nThe president went on to complain about the 'massive' size of some federal agencies.\n\nAs of last month, the Trump administration had installed roughly a quarter of the personnel needed to fill some 600 appointed positions that require Senate confirmation, as NPR's Tamara Keith has reported.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/03/561797675/im-the-only-one-that-matters-trump-says-of-state-dept-job-vacancies","1509681600.0"
"Japan braces as North Korea threatens hydrogen bomb test in Pacific\nJapan must brace itself for the possible launch of a nuclear-armed North Korean missile over its territory if the regime carries out a threat to test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean, Japan’s defence minister has said.\n\nThe warning followed an extraordinary exchange of insults between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in response to the US president’s threat at the UN general assembly to “totally destroy” North Korea if Washington was forced to defend itself or its allies.\n\nKim said that he was considering retaliating at the “highest level”, calling Trump a “mentally deranged US dotard” who would “pay dearly” for threatening to destroy his regime. The North Korean foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, suggested Pyongyang could test a powerful nuclear weapon in the Pacific.\n\n“It could be the most powerful detonation of an H-bomb in the Pacific,” Ri, who is due to address the UN general assembly at the weekend, told reporters in New York. “We have no idea about what actions could be taken as it will be ordered by leader Kim Jong-un.”\n\nTrump tweeted in response on Friday: “Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn’t mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!”\n\n\n\nItsunori Onodera, the Japanese defence minister, warned such a test could involve a nuclear device mounted on a medium-range or intercontinental ballistic missile being flown over Japan. “We cannot deny the possibility it may fly over our country,” he said.\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea detonated a powerful hydrogen bomb at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the north-east of the country. The explosion caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake that was felt over the Chinese border in Yanji.\n\n'A rogue and a gangster': Kim Jong-un's statement on Trump in full Read more\n\nTesting a nuclear device beyond its own borders would mark a major escalation in tensions over the regime’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes.\n\nAnalysts said a nuclear test involving a missile could be “truly terrifying” if something goes wrong.\n\nAn atmospheric nuclear test could pose a risk to aircraft and shipping, even if the North declares a keep-out zone, according to Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategy expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n“And if the test doesn’t go according to plan, you could have population at risk, too,” Narang added. “We are talking about putting a live nuclear warhead on a missile that has been tested only a handful of times. It is truly terrifying if something goes wrong.”\n\n\n\nSpeculation is growing that North Korea will add to its robust verbal response to Trump’s UN speech on Tuesday with a military provocation, possibly a test of a Hwasong-14 missile, which is theoretically capable of reaching Hawaii and Alaska.\n\nChung Sung-yoon, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said there was a “very high possibility” that Kim would follow through with a provocation of some sort.\n\nWhile the North has claimed it is able to mount a miniaturised nuclear weapon on a missile, the regime has yet to offer definitive proof.\n\nThe US and Japan have warned they will shoot down any missile they consider a threat to Japanese territory.\n\nMonitoring groups estimate that the nuclear test conducted in North Korea this month - its sixth and largest - had a yield of 250 kilotons, which is 16 times the size of the US bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.\n\nIn a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, Kim called Trump “mentally deranged” and warned him that he would “pay dearly” for issuing threats to the regime during his maiden UN general assembly speech on Tuesday.\n\nDescribing the president as “a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire”, Kim drew a critical comparison between Trump and his predecessors in the White House, calling him unfit to hold the position of commander in chief.\n\n\n\n“Far from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defuse tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors.”\n\nIn a combative speech, Trump warned he would “totally destroy” North Korea if it attacked the US or its allies, and called on other countries to cut the regime off from its sources of funds.\n\n\n\n“The mentally deranged behaviour of the US president openly expressing on the UN arena the unethical will to ‘totally destroy’ a sovereign state … makes even those with normal thinking faculty think about discretion and composure,” Kim said.\n\nQ&A How does a hydrogen bomb differ from an atomic bomb? Show Hide The difference lies in the heart of the bomb. Atomic bombs rely on nuclear fission to produce a blast: atoms of weapons-grade uranium or plutonium are split by neutrons, releasing energy as well as more neutrons - triggering a chain reaction.\n\nHydrogen bombs incorporate nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. As in an atomic bomb, fission generates neutrons and energy. This energy is used to kick off the fusion of 'heavy” types of hydrogen in another part of the bomb. The fusion reaction also releases energy and neutrons, which then trigger further fission reactions. The upshot is a far more powerful blast. A boosted atomic bomb is a sort of hybrid of the two approaches, using a small quantity of fusion material together with an atomic bomb core. It is not as powerful as a hydrogen bomb.\n\nThe North Korea leader is thought to be the first of three generations of the Kim dynasty to publicly read out a statement aimed at the international community in his own name.\n\nSouth Korea’s unification ministry said neither Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, nor his grandfather - and North Korean founder - Kim Il-sung, had issued a similar statement.\n\n\n\nKim said Trump’s remarks had convinced him “that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last”.\n\n\n\nHe added that he was “thinking hard” about his response, but vowed that Trump would “pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying” North Korea.\n\n“Action is the best option in treating the dotard, who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say,” he said.\n\n“Now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy [North Korea], we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.”\n\n\n\nHis lengthy criticism of Trump ended: “I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.”\n\nThe statement came just hours after Trump issued a new executive order that expands US sanctions on North Korea’s shipping, banking, ports and manufacturing. Trump also claimed China’s banking system had shut down business with the country.\n\n\n\nReuters reported earlier in the day that China’s central bank had ordered financial institutions to implement UN sanctions rigorously after frequent complaints from Washington that Beijing was leaving open too many loopholes.\n\nTrump issues new sanctions on North Korea and claims China is following Read more\n\nTrump thanked China’s president Xi Jinping and said the move was “very bold” and “somewhat unexpected”.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from the Chinese government that it had imposed a financial embargo on North Korea. If confirmed, it would represent a significant tightening of the economic noose around the Pyongyang regime, by a country which accounts for 90% of its trade.\n\nBut it is unclear whether any amount of financial or economic pain would induce Kim Jong-un to relinquish North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles, which he believes are essential for the regime’s survival.\n\nTrump announced the new executive order during a working lunch with his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, and Shinzō Abe, the Japanese prime minister.\n\n“Our new executive order will cut off sources of revenue that fund North Korea’s efforts to develop the deadliest weapons known to humankind,” Trump said. “The order enhances the treasury department’s authorities to target any individual or entity that conducts significant trade in goods, services, or technology with North Korea.”\n\nUnder the new measures, no ship or aircraft can visit the US within 180 days of going to North Korea. The same restriction would apply to any vessel involvement in ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean vessels. The order gives the US Treasury the power to sanction anybody involved in a wide variety of North Korean industries, ports, trade, and banking.\n\n“Foreign financial institutions must choose between doing business with the United States or facilitating trade with North Korea or its designated supporters,” a White House statement said.\n\n“To prevent sanctions evasion, the order also includes measures designed to disrupt critical North Korean shipping and trade networks,” he said. “For much too long, North Korea has been allowed to abuse the international financial system to facilitate funding for its nuclear weapons and missile programs.”\n\nOn the same day, the EU announced new sanctions of its own, including a ban on investment in North Korea and on EU exports of oil. The impact will be minimal, as trade and investment relations between North Korea and EU are tiny.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/21/kim-jong-un-trump-north-korea-threats","1505966400.0"
"White man traveled to New York to kill black men and ‘make a statement,’ police say\nSurveillance footage allegedly shows a man New York City police say is accused of a stabbing attack on a black man. (New York Police Department)\n\nA white man from Maryland who told police he traveled to New York to kill black men turned himself in on Wednesday, about 24 hours after he fatally stabbed a man he encountered on the street, officials said.\n\nAuthorities described the suspected attacker as someone who had long harbored feelings of hatred toward black men before violently acting on them this week. Police said he carried out the attack in a way that intended to draw attention.\n\n“The reason why he picked New York is ’cause it’s the media capital of the world,” said William Aubry, assistant chief of the New York City Police Department. “And he wanted to make a statement.”\n\nNew York police said they charged James Harris Jackson, 28, with murder. Police said Jackson encountered 66-year-old Timothy Caughman shortly after 11 p.m. on Monday and stabbed him multiple times. Caughman went to a police precinct for help and was brought to Bellevue Hospital, where he died, police said.\n\n[FBI investigating shooting of two Indian men in Kansas as a hate crime]\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, a little more than 24 hours after the attack, Jackson walked into the police substation in Times Square and announced that he was wanted for murder.\n\n\n\nJames Harris Jackson, in white, is escorted out of a police precinct in New York on Wednesday. (Seth Wenig/AP)\n\n“‘I’m the person you’re looking for,'” Jackson told the patrol officers there, Aubry said at a briefing later Wednesday.\n\nJackson also told them he had knives in his pockets, and police searched him and took him into custody, Aubry said. Police recovered what Aubry called a 26-inch “black mini-sword,” which he said police believe is the weapon used to stab Caughman in the back.\n\nThe attack is “extremely distressing,” James P. O’Neill, the New York City police commissioner, said at the same briefing.\n\nPolice gave few details of Jackson’s background on Wednesday, identifying him only as a Baltimore resident and military veteran. Jackson was in the Army for more than three years, deploying to Afghanistan between December 2010 and November 2011, according to Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson, an Army spokesperson. His service record did not include any badges reflecting combat interaction with any enemy during that time. Jackson served as a military intelligence analyst and left the service in August 2012 with the rank of specialist.\n\n[He yelled ‘Get out of my country,’ witnesses say, and then shot 2 men from India, killing one]\n\nJackson’s arraigned was still pending Thursday afternoon, and it was not immediately clear from court dockets whether he had an attorney.\n\nBaltimore police said they do not have records of any interactions with Jackson, and his name did not appear in a search of Maryland court records. Authorities also said that Jackson traveled to New York from Baltimore on a Bolt Bus on Friday, staying at a hotel in midtown until Monday afternoon, at which point “he proceeded to wander through the city,” Aubry said.\n\nAubry said the initial investigation gave detectives little question about what prompted the stabbing.\n\n“Based on statements that he made as well as a preliminary review of video, it reveals that the attack on Timothy Caughman was clearly racially motivated,” he said. Aubry went on to say that Jackson “was specifically intending to target male blacks for assault.”\n\nWhile Aubry did not elaborate on what Jackson said to police about what motivated the stabbing, he did say that Jackson “has been harboring these types of feelings for quite some time,” adding: “It’s well over 10 years that he’s been harboring these feelings of hate towards male blacks.”\n\nPublic officials decried the stabbing as an act of racial hatred. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) issued a statement calling the attack “more than an unspeakable human tragedy” and an assault on the city’s “inclusiveness and our diversity.”\n\n“Now it’s our collective responsibility to speak clearly and forcefully in the face of intolerance and violence — here or across the country,” he said. “We are a safe city because we are inclusive. We are a nation of unrivaled strength because we are diverse. No act of violence can undermine who we are.”\n\nMelissa Mark-Viverito (D), speaker of the New York City Council, called Jackson a white supremacist. She also tied the attack to a recent spike in reports of hate crimes both in the city and nationwide and invoked the election of President Trump, saying in a statement that the attack highlighted a growing divide that he “has only made worse.”\n\nIn a statement Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said he was appalled by the stabbing and said his administration had “zero tolerance for hate crimes of any kind.”\n\n“We will not allow the forces of racism and hate to intimidate or divide us,” Cuomo said. “Let me be very clear: This disturbing act of violence goes against everything New York stands for. Not only must we repudiate this attack, but we must continue to deny that the ideas behind this cowardly crime have any place in democratic society.​”\n\nOfficials say they are looking into Jackson’s background, relatives and his social media history, and detectives traveled to Maryland to speak with people there. Police said they have not found many interactions with law enforcement. New York police are working with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to see if they can upgrade the charges against Jackson to include that it was motivated by hate or racism, Aubry said.\n\nJackson “was very forthcoming” with detectives and “knew what he was doing when he came up here,” Aubry said.\n\nAubry said the stabbing appeared to be random, saying that Caughman “happened to be going through garbage on the sidewalk, and he happened to be the unfortunate one” who Jackson encountered.\n\nJulie Tate and Dan Lamothe contributed to this report, which was first published on Wednesday at 6:21 p.m. and updated Thursday with details about the arraignment.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nNYPD says Trump’s budget would gut New York’s counterterrorism efforts, make the city less safe","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/22/white-man-traveled-to-new-york-to-kill-black-men-and-make-a-statement-police-say/","1490155200.0"
"Dakota Access Pipeline Court Challenge Denied, Oil Could Flow As Soon As Next Week\nDakota Access Pipeline Court Challenge Denied, Oil Could Flow As Soon As Next Week\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA federal judge has denied a request by the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River tribes to halt construction of the final piece of the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\nIn a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied the tribe's motion for a preliminary injunction against the pipeline company. The tribes are arguing that the completion of the pipeline construction just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation endangers their drinking water source, part of the Missouri River called Lake Oahe, and that the pipeline has damaged cultural sites.\n\nThe pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, has been drilling under Lake Oahe for weeks, and said oil could start flowing through that section of the pipeline as early as next week.\n\nIn explaining his decision, Judge Boasberg laid out the progression of the case since it was originally filed last summer:\n\n'Since last summer, the question of whether Dakota Access should route its oil pipeline near the reservations of American Indian tribes has engendered substantial debate both on the ground in North and South Dakota and here in Washington. '... At the start of 2017, that pipeline was nearly complete, save a stretch — awaiting an easement — that was designed to run under the bed of Lake Oahe, a federally regulated waterway that forms part of the Missouri River and straddles North and South Dakota. 'Upon assuming office, President Trump directed an expedited approval process, and on February 8, the Army Corps of Engineers issued the easement that permitted Dakota Access to drill under the lake. Fearing that the presence of oil in the pipeline under Lake Oahe will cause irreparable harm to its members' religious exercise, Cheyenne River responded with a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, in which it argues that the easement's grant violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and requests that the Court enjoin the effect of the easement and thus the flow of oil, which is expected to commence in the next week or two.'\n\nExplaining he believed the tribes were unlikely to prevail in their lawsuit at this point, Boasberg denied their request to halt construction on the pipeline, or stop oil from flowing through it once it is complete.\n\nThe plaintiffs have not announced any change to their legal approach to the case.\n\nIn a statement after the decision was announced, Chase Iron Eyes, the lead counsel for the Lakota People's Law Project, which is supporting the legal challenges to the pipeline, wrote 'Oil should never be allowed to flow through this pipeline until the legal process has played out in the courts.'\n\nIron Eyes also accused the federal government and the army of 'treating the original inhabitants of this land as though we are less than human, as though our lives and lands are something to be ignored and discarded in the never-ending quest for profit.'\n\nAs we have reported, in April 2016 a senior field archaeologist for the Army Corps identified about 30 sites near the route of the pipeline that were of potential cultural significance, but determined that 'no historic properties will be subject to effect,' by the crossing under Lake Oahe.\n\nIn late February, North Dakota's governor ordered people camped near the construction site, some of whom had been demonstrating against the pipeline for months, to leave the largest encampment, citing flooding concerns as snow melted.\n\nOthers opposed to the pipeline have continued to protest elsewhere in the country. Over the weekend, a group of people gathered outside Trump Tower in New York City, some carrying signs advocating for the rights of indigenous Americans, and others expressing anger about President Trump's decision to allow the pipeline to go forward.\n\nOn March 10, a coalition of groups is planning a demonstration in Washington, D.C., known as the Native Nations March.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/07/519040535/dakota-access-pipeline-court-challenge-denied-oil-could-flow-as-soon-as-next-wee","1488862800.0"

"Daca: Trump 'to scrap' amnesty for young immigrants\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Many recipients of the Daca programme have taken to the streets to defend it\n\nUS President Donald Trump has decided to scrap a programme that protects young undocumented immigrants, according to reports.\n\nHe will give Congress six months to draw up legislation to replace the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), sources quoted by US media say.\n\nThe decision, first reported in Politico, is considered a compromise amid strong support for the scheme.\n\nHowever, the sources cautioned that Mr Trump could still change his mind.\n\nHe is due to formally announce his decision on Tuesday.\n\nThe Obama-era Daca programme protects hundreds of thousands of so-called 'Dreamers' from deportation and provides work and study permits.\n\nTrump puts his party in tough spot\n\nAnthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington\n\nCandidate Trump promised to do away with Daca, and it appears that's what he's going to do, despite warnings from a cross-party collection of politicians. Or, knowing this president, those objections from 'the establishment' only make him more determined to act.\n\nFortunately for him, unlike repealing Obamacare or building his Mexican border wall, he doesn't need Congress's help here.\n\nIn fact, by setting a six-month fuse on Daca's destruction, Mr Trump puts all the pressure on legislators if they want to protect undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children.\n\nWhile the votes may be there for some type of fix, Congress already has its hands full with other pressing issues - hurricane relief, budget resolutions, the need to authorise new government debt and, at some point, tax reform.\n\nMr Trump may not care, but he's putting Republicans with tough re-election races in a difficult spot. If the president's Daca bomb goes off, they will face angry constituents just as the campaign season gets into gear.\n\nThe president, however, satisfies his anti-immigration base with this move - and washes his hands of the matter. The loyalists who have stood by him are rewarded, others in his party be damned.\n\nAccording to Politico, the White House informed House Speaker Paul Ryan of the president's decision on Sunday morning.\n\nMr Ryan last week urged the president not to scrap the scheme, arguing it left many young people 'in limbo'.\n\n'These are kids who know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don't know another home,' he said.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption President Trump has previously said he 'loves' the Dreamers\n\nMr Ryan is one of a growing number of Republican lawmakers and business leaders to speak out against scrapping the programme.\n\nWhile campaigning for office, Mr Trump took a hard-line on immigration and said he planned to 'immediately terminate' the Daca programme.\n\nBut since then he has said he finds the subject 'very, very tough'.\n\nHe said he intends to show 'great heart' in dealing with what he described as, in many cases, 'incredible kids'.\n\nThe decision to give Congress six months to draft an alternative is seen as a compromise after Republican lawmakers and business leaders from companies including Google, General Motors and Microsoft urged Mr Trump to retain the programme.\n\nOn Sunday, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted: 'Thanks to Dreamers' courage & resolve, #DACA has allowed thousands of young people to contribute to our society. We're better for it.'\n\nIleana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican Representative from Florida, also took to Twitter to vent her frustration, saying: 'After teasing #Dreamers for months with talk of his 'great heart,' @POTUS slams door on them.

"Tesla’s big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategy\n(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk took many risks with the technology in his company’s cars on the way to surpassing Ford Motor Co’s market value. Now Musk is pushing boundaries in the factory that makes them.\n\nMost automakers test a new model’s production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don’t have gaps or seams.\n\nTesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month.\n\nMusk’s decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS\n\n* China clamps down on steel surplus\n\n* French election relief sends markets soaring\n\n* Few clues on casualties at site of huge U.S. bomb in Afghanistan\n\nMusk expects the Model 3 rollout to help Tesla deliver five times its current annual sales volume, a key target in the automaker’s efforts to stop burning cash.\n\n“He’s pushing the envelope to see how much time and cost he can take out of the process,” said Ron Harbour, a manufacturing consultant at Oliver Wyman.\n\nInvestors are already counting on Tesla’s factory floor success, with shares soaring 39 percent since January as it makes the leap from niche producer to mass producer in far less time than rivals.\n\nThere are caution signs, however. The production equipment designed to produce millions of cars is expensive to fix or replace if it doesn’t work, industry experts say. Tesla has encountered quality problems on its existing low-volume cars, and the Model 3 is designed to sell in numbers as high as 500,000 vehicles a year, raising the potential cost of recalls or warranty repairs.\n\n“It’s an experiment, certainly,” said Consumer Reports’ Jake Fisher, who has done extensive testing of Tesla’s previous Models S and X. Tesla could possibly fix errors quicker, speeding up the process, “or it could be they have unsuspected problems they’ll have a hard time dealing with.”\n\nMusk discussed the decision to skip what he referred to as 'beta' production testing during a call last month with an invited group of investors. Details were published on Reddit by an investor on the call. (here).\n\nHe also said that “advanced analytical techniques” – code word for computer simulations - would help Tesla in advancing straight to production tooling.\n\nTesla declined to confirm details of the call or comment on its production strategy.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe auto industry’s incumbents have not been standing still. Volkswagen AG’s Audi division launched production of a new plant in Mexico using computer simulations of production tools – and indeed the entire assembly line and factory - that Audi said it believed to be an industry first. That process allowed the plant to launch production 30 percent faster than usual, Audi said.\n\nAn Audi executive involved in the Mexican plant launch, Peter Hochholdinger, is now Tesla’s vice president of production.\n\nMAKING TOOLS FASTER\n\nTypically, automakers test their design with limited production using lower grade equipment that can be modified slightly to address problems. When most of the kinks are worked out, they order the final equipment.\n\nTesla’s decision to move directly to the final tools is in part because lower grade, disposable equipment known as “soft tooling” ended up complicating the debut of the problem-plagued Model X SUV in 2015, according to a person familiar with the decision and Tesla’s assembly line planning.\n\nWorking on a tight deadline, Tesla had no time to incorporate lessons learned from soft tooling before having to order the permanent production tooling, making the former’s value negligible, the source said.\n\n“Soft tooling did very little for the program and arguably hurt things,” said the person.\n\nIn addition, Tesla has learned to better modify final production tools, and its 2015 purchase of a Michigan tooling company means it can make major equipment 30 percent faster than before, and more cheaply as well, the source said.\n\nFinancial pressure is partly driving Tesla’s haste. The quicker Tesla can deliver the Model 3 with its estimated $35,000 base price to the 373,000 customers who have put down a $1000 deposit, the closer it can log $13 billion.\n\nTesla has labored under financial pressure since it was founded in 2003. The company has yet to turn an annual profit, and earlier this year Musk said the company was “close to the edge” as it look toward capital spending of $2-2.5 billion in the first half of 2017.\n\nTesla has since gotten more breathing room by raising $1.2 billion in fresh capital in March and selling a five per cent stake to Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) .\n\nMusk has spoken to investors about his vision of an “alien dreadnought” factory that uses artificial intelligence and robots to build cars at speeds faster than human assembly workers could manage.\n\nBut there are limits to what technology can do in the heavily regulated car business. For example, Tesla will still have to use real cars in crash tests required by the U.S. government, because federal rules do not allow simulated crash results to substitute for data from a real car.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-assemblyline/teslas-big-model-3-bet-rides-on-risky-assembly-line-strategy-idUSKBN17Q0DE","1493057145.0"
"Mumbai fights to fix its crowded, crumbling and deadly rail network\nMumbai, India (CNN) It's a typical workday morning in Mumbai and commuters are rushing to get on and off trains at Prabhadevi station.\n\nEvery day in this city, seven and a half million people pack into commuter trains and steel themselves for the daily ordeal of traveling to and from work.\n\nThe veneer of Bollywood and billionaires may lend India's financial heart an aura of glamor, but the workers in the country's most densely packed city, from office staff to snack sellers, risk their lives every day while navigating a transport system meant to serve an earlier century.\n\nAt the center of the problem is the crumbling Mumbai local railway network -- the backbone of the city's transport infrastructure.\n\nStatistics associated with the railway read like a war zone: Since 2007, according to Mumbai Railway Police data , nearly 38,000 people have died in train related accidents. That's more than 3,200 deaths every year and an average of nine deaths every day.\n\nAnd now a fresh nightmare is seared in the minds of Mumbai's train commuters. Here -- where Mumbai's Prabhadevi and Parel stations are joined by a narrow footbridge -- 23 people were crushed to death on an exit stairwell on the morning of Friday September 29.\n\nThat morning there was a sudden heavy rain, and several trains had just arrived.\n\nExiting passengers had gathered on the overpass and near the stairways, waiting for the rains to subside. As more trains arrived, the usual crowding became extreme.\n\nThe result of an official inquiry into what triggered the stampede may take several weeks, but passengers offer theories: There were shouts about a roof collapse, screams about seeing sparks. Perhaps someone tripped. It doesn't take much to trigger panic when people are packed so tightly they can't raise an arm.\n\nCommuters pause to look at photos of the stampede victims at Prabhadevi station, formerly known as Elphinstone station.\n\n'Fear is always there'\n\nOn a sunny morning several days on from the stampede, passengers trudge down the same stairs where the tragedy took place. Some squeeze past the exiting passengers to head up the stairs with wide bundles on their heads.\n\n'Every day, we face death while traveling,' says a young woman whose friend died in the stampede. She nods angrily toward two nearby policemen. 'Why are they here today, after it has all happened?'\n\nAlong the dilapidated walkway at the base of the staircase, commuters pause to look at two makeshift memorials -- posters displaying photos of the victims hang above tables covered in melted candles and fading flowers.\n\nSince 2007, almost 38,000 people have died in train related accidents in Mumbai.\n\nOne poster shows the victims' photos taken when they were alive. Steps away, another poster shows the bruised and swollen faces of the dead.\n\nFurther down the path, commuters rush past the remnants of the stampede: A jumble of sandals and shoes, a bright blue scarf and a scattering of crushed marigolds. The flowers were being sold for a religious festival.\n\nShoes of Prabhadevi station stampede victims remain uncollected on the floor of the station, a constant reminder of the inherent risks of train travel in Mumbai.\n\nMumbai commuters have long complained online about the dangerous conditions at Prabhadevi station, which was formerly known as Elphinstone station, and other stations across the city. Posts on Twitter now seem prophetic.\n\nCommuter Bandish Satra tweeted four times about this station's problems, starting in early February. In late August he wrote about a 'serious risk of stampede and loss of lives.' Many others had posted similar warnings tagging railway officials.\n\n@sureshpprabhu serious risk of stampede and loss of lives at parel station overbrige leading to exit towards elphinstone — Bandish Satra (@BandishSatra) February 2, 2017\n\nBut in general, the deadly train system is accepted as a fact of life. As one young woman explains, 'It's our daily routine. What can we do? Fear is always there.' People are willing to take the risks because the trains are far faster and cheaper than the roads. And a job and a daily wage take priority over time spent filing complaints and lobbying officials.\n\nThe risks are known\n\nThe majority of Mumbai's train related deaths are caused by crossing train tracks and falling out of moving trains. People slip or are accidentally pushed as they cling to jam packed open doorways; frantic passengers grab on to a single pole in the doorway or grip the edges of the open doors.\n\nThe risks are known, but the desperation to get to work or home prevails. As one commuter explains, 'People hang on to the doorways from outside of the train. They don't want to wait half an hour for the next train and they still might not get on.'\n\nAnd crossing train tracks is a common practice because there aren't enough pedestrian overpasses, or they are too crowded or because some, like the elderly, can't climb the many stairs. Or because, when numbed to the risks, it just seems more convenient.\n\nMany passengers hanging from the doorways are killed when they smack against the signal posts and poles along the tracks.\n\nAn estimate by IndiaSpend -- a nonprofit research group -- found that Mumbai's local trains are packed on average to 2.6 times their capacity. That's 30% more than Tokyo's infamously crowded railway cars, according to IndiaSpend.\n\nCommuters enter and exit the footbridge, now guarded by a security official, where the stampede occured at Prabhadevi station.\n\nDreams meet reality\n\nThe stampede may be jolting more to action.\n\nIt's drawn new anger against a state proposal for Mumbai to have world's largest statue. The proposed 210 meter (roughly 700 feet) tall memorial statue of Shivaji -- the 17th century warrior king for whom Mumbai's airport and a major city train station are already named -- would be built on a man-made island and visible from the city.\n\nThe estimated cost of this memorial: over half a billion US dollars. In the wake of the stampede, more than 29,000 people have signed an online petition demanding that the money be diverted to improving train service.\n\nCitizens are also venting against the Central government's plan for a $17-billion bullet train -- India's first - which would run from the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat state into Mumbai.\n\nA train makes its way between Varsova and Ghatkopar stations, Mumbai, 2014.\n\nMumbai based architect and urban planner Chandrashekhar Prabhu, a former president of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, says for a fraction of the cost of a bullet train, more than 7 million people in Mumbai could get relief from the deadly daily commute.\n\n'We like flamboyant themes and to keep people dreaming. We don't bother for solving the daily problems,' he says bitterly.\n\nTo solve the problem of the trains, Prabhu says, the city planners and the railway authority need to work together. Mumbai's overburdened trains and antiquated stations are the result of an 'absolute disconnect' between the administration of the Railways and the City's urban planning, he explains. The location of the tragedy illustrates this dilemma.\n\nCommuters enter into Prabhadevi station. The area around the station has undergone rapid urban growth in recent years.\n\nThe neighborhood where the stampede took place used to be filled with textile mills. Shift workers mostly walked to their jobs. When the mills began to close in the early 1980s, the area instantly became prime real estate -- a way for Mumbai to expand north from its congested south.\n\n'The mill lands are the lands which came up for indiscriminate urbanization, without any study, without any study of impact on transport,' Prabhu says, 'By a stroke of the pen, permissions were given where they ought not to have been given.'\n\nSo the gleaming office towers sprang up and drew tens of thousands of new workers who crammed the old streets and packed the train stations built for a bygone era.\n\nIndian authorities are moving to strip Mumbai's railway stations of their British names, as leaders seek to purge the city of remnants of its colonial past.\n\nThe new normal\n\nThe day after the stampede Railway Minister Piyush Goyal held an emergency meeting and ordered improvements.\n\nMumbai Activist Samir Zaveri is skeptical. He's been fighting for change in the Mumbai railroads for 25 years: One rainy night when he was 17-years-old, Zaveri crossed railroad tracks on his way home because there was no other way to get from one side of the track to the other. 'It was a heavy rain and I was holding an umbrella and I was running,'\n\nHe slipped and fell and was hit by a train severing both his legs. 'My body was outside the railway track and my legs were left on the track,' he now describes matter of factly. Since then, he has taken railroad officials to court over corruption and wasteful spending, and successfully fought to get waiting ambulances and doctors mandated at stations.\n\n'The station was overcrowded. This is a fact that was ignored,' Zaveri says, 'So this is India, here this is normal. There is no priority for prevention. After the death of people, they will work. People get killed and then they do the work.'","https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/06/asia/india-mumbai-deadly-commute/index.html","1507262400.0"
"White supremacists picked fight with an interracial couple after Tennessee rally, police say\nHours after a “White Lives Matter” rally unfolded Saturday in Shelbyville, Tenn. — resulting in lots of counterprotesters, but no violence — a fight broke out between a smaller group of white supremacists and an interracial couple at a restaurant in Brentwood, about 50 miles to the north.\n\nThe couple, a 30-year-old white woman and a 37-year-old black man, were dining inside the Corner Pub when a group of about 20 to 30 white men and women came in and sat at a table behind them, according to a statement by the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department.\n\nThe 30-year-old woman later told police that one of the group members asked her to “guess” and that she responded “white lives matter,” police said.\n\n“Another said ‘that’s right’ and told her to join their table and leave her boyfriend,” police said in a statement. “The argument inside apparently escalated even after the female victim had gone outside to de-escalate the situation.”\n\nPolice said another woman from the self-identified “white lives matter” group began to argue with the 30-year-old woman, who was then reportedly punched in the face by a man, causing a cut above her eye. She did not seek medical treatment, police said.\n\nThe fight was captured on video by Annelise Werme, a Tennessee resident who said she had driven to Brentwood to escape “the rally chaos” farther south. While at the Corner Pub, Werme said she recognized a group of white supremacists walk into the restaurant.\n\n“These guys, maybe 20 of them, dressed in all black, paraded through to an adjoining room, and immediately started harassing a biracial [interracial] couple there,” Werme wrote in Facebook post that has since been widely shared. “It broke out into a huge fight with them busting open the face of the white girl who was furious with them for harassing them. I honestly can’t believe this is happening. My heart hurts.”\n\nWerme posted a picture of the group of men filing into the restaurant, along with video of the altercation after it had apparently spilled out onto the street. Footage showed a tight cluster of people, shoving one another and appearing to shout. At one point, a woman is pushed back against a window of the pub and blood is visible on her face.\n\n“Oh, my God, they’re — she’s bleeding,” a man inside the restaurant says in the video.\n\nWerme did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday afternoon.\n\nBy the time officers arrived at the restaurant, all of the parties involved in the altercation were gone; however, the 30-year-old woman later returned to the Corner Pub to file a report, police said.\n\nAn investigation into the assault is ongoing. Police said they are looking for the man who punched the woman, and described him as a white male in his 30s wearing a black jacket and black jeans. The female victim told police that people in the group left the scene in multiple cars, including a white van with a Wisconsin license plate and a sedan with a New York license plate.\n\n[‘White Lives Matter’ rally organizers adjust strategy to avoid becoming ‘another Charlottesville’]\n\nJerry Grim, the manager of Corner Pub, told The Washington Post the restaurant was about half full when the fight broke out.\n\n“Unfortunately, we don’t know much other than some people were eating and that turned into an argument,” Grim said. “Everything was fine and then all of sudden people started talking and everyone was yelling.”\n\nHe said an incident like that is extremely unusual for the pub.\n\n“This is a family sports bar. We’ve got kids, babies in here . . . we all cheer for our teams,” he said. “It’s a nice place to come.”\n\nIn a phone interview late Saturday with Mic reporter Jack Smith IV, white nationalist leader Matthew Heimbach disputed claims their group had started the fight at the pub, instead blaming the black man who was part of the interracial couple. Heimbach claimed their group tried to de-escalate the situation — and that the woman who was bloodied “jumped in and took swings at people.”\n\nHeimbach told Smith their group did not report anything to police.\n\nJust got off the phone with white nationalist leader Matthew Heimbach—here's a rough transcript of our quick chat about the fight in TN: pic.twitter.com/wg0W7Hnn8U — Jack Smith IV (@JackSmithIV) October 29, 2017\n\nFears of violence had plagued officials and residents of Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, Tenn., leading up to the “White Lives Matter” rallies. (A second rally planned for Murfreesboro was canceled Saturday.) Most wanted to avoid the same disastrous outcome in Charlottesville, when a “Unite the Right” rally on Aug. 12 turned deadly after a car plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman and injuring at least 19 other people.\n\nAs The Post’s Wesley Lowery reported from Shelbyville, about twice as many counterprotesters as “White Lives Matter” participants showed up Saturday, ultimately overwhelming them:\n\nThroughout the morning, the counterprotest oscillated between mocking the rally and drowning it out with music. At various points, they played the “Ghostbusters” song, Michael Jackson’s “Black or White” and the theme song to “Jeopardy.” When the rally’s speakers tried to address the crowd they were drown out by “black lives matter” chants. In between speakers, organizers teased the white supremacists. “Yo, Nazis!” a counterprotester with a megaphone shouted. “How does it feel knowing your daughters are probably all at home listening to rap music and hanging out with their black boyfriends right now?”\n\n“It was an effective show of force,” counterprotester Kubby Barry, 39, told Lowery. “It was important to show up and show people that we don’t stand for their message.”\n\n\n\nMatthew Heimbach of the Traditionalist Workers Party speaks to participants at a white nationalist’s rally on Oct. 28 in Shelbyville, Tenn. The event billed as a White Lives Matter rally is hosted by Nationalist Front, which is a coalition of several white supremacist organizations.

"Google staffer's hostility to affirmative action sparks furious backlash\nA Google software engineer’s polemic against diversity efforts has left female staff “shaking in anger” and forced the tech giant to defend its patchy record on racial and gender equality.\n\nThe 10-page “manifesto”, which Google executives acknowledge was written by a company software engineer, initially circulated internally but was leaked to the public. The author’s identity remains unknown.\n\nThe manifesto argues that the lack of women in tech and leadership is the result, at least in part, of innate differences between in men and women. “I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership,” the author writes.\n\n\n\nAfter a number of female staff described their disgust at the document on social media, Google sent out a company-wide memo saying it did not represent the company’s views.\n\nThe document’s author claims that the company’s problem is “left bias”, but the row will raise questions about attitudes to women among some members of staff and force Google back into uncomfortable discussions of its record on gender equality, which progressive critics say is poor.\n\nThe US Department of Labor found in April that there were systemic issues with equal pay across the company, and described discrimination there as “quite extreme”.\n\nMen are from Mars, women are from Venus? New brain study says not Read more\n\nGoogle’s perceived political leanings also came under fire, with the author arguing that those with conservative views currently have to “stay in the closet” to dodge open hostility.\n\n\n\n“When it comes to diversity and inclusion, Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence,” the author writes. “Conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness, which is required for much of the drudgery and maintenance work characteristic of a mature company.”\n\nThe document fuelled alarm and outrage on social media and sent Google executives scrambling to disavow its message. Hours after it became public, Google’s new vice-president of diversity, integrity and governance, Danielle Brown, sent an email to company employees saying that its “incorrect assumptions about gender” were “not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages”.\n\nOn Twitter, women in the tech industry called for Google to take action. Brianna Wu, a US-based software engineer, asked who was going to be fired over the manifesto, while Jaana Dogan, a programmer at Google, tweeted:\n\nJaana B. Dogan 👀 (@rakyll) If HR does nothing in this case, I will consider leaving this company for real for the first time in five years.\n\nOthers were less surprised to hear what they called a pervasive attitude in an industry long dominated by men. The manifesto “is the Silicon Valley mindset in many ways,” said Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon University college of engineering and a frequent critic of the tech sector’s lack of diversity. “You could take this to a lot of people and you would hear: ‘Yup, we agree with this.’ People used to say things like this fearlessly.”\n\nWadhwa said the document was an example of the resistance companies such as Google encounter as they attempt to make their firms more equitable.\n\nThe company’s own record has come in for frequent criticism. Google was one of the first tech giants to disclose demographic information about its workforce in public. The first time the company released the data, though, it revealed Google to be more white and male than the likes of LinkedIn and Yahoo.\n\n\n\nThe company released figures in June showing that the proportion of female and black employees across the company as a whole had not changed from 2015 to 2016. There was a modest increase in the proportion of women in tech and leadership roles and the number of Latino employees, but only 20% of Google’s tech roles were filled by women, below the national average of 26%.Asian employees made up 35% of the company’s workforce, but they were underrepresented in leadership roles.\n\nThe manifesto claims that men have a higher drive for status, that women might not like coding because they have more interest than men in “people and aesthetics”, and that the low number of women in “high stress jobs” is down to them having more “neuroticism”. “We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,” the author writes.\n\nThe document also claims that the gender wage gap is a myth, but Google is locked in an ongoing battle with US labour regulators claiming to have evidence that the company systematically undercompensates women.\n\n“The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry,” a US Department of Labor lawyer said in April, adding that the agency had “compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters”.\n\nGoogle disputes the agency’s claims, saying it has eliminated its wage gap.\n\nIn her letter to Google employees, Brown also took issue with the notion Google stifled certain political opinions. “I’ve never worked at a company that has so many platforms for employees to express themselves,” she wrote. Employees of different political views should feel free to voice their opinions, she said. “But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment.”\n\nThe vice-president of engineering at Google, Ari Balogh, also weighed in on the latest furore with an internal memo criticising the manifesto. “One of the aspects of the post that troubled me deeply was the bias inherent in suggesting that most women, or men, feel or act a certain way. That is stereotyping, and it is harmful,” he wrote. “Building an open, inclusive environment is core to who we are, and the right thing to do. ’Nuff said.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/06/google-staffers-manifesto-against-affirmative-action-sparks-furious-backlash","1501992000.0"

"A $500 surprise expense would put most Americans into debt\nWhile the jobless rate is down and wages are up, most Americans nevertheless remain one misstep away from a financial crisis.\n\nFifty-seven percent of Americans don’t have enough cash to cover a $500 unexpected expense, according to a new survey from Bankrate, which interviewed 1,003 adults earlier this month. While that may appear dire, it reflects a slight improvement from 2016, when 63 percent of U.S. residents said they wouldn’t be able to handle such an expense. The improvement reflects the stronger U.S. economy, but is still far from ideal, Bankrate.com said.\n\nThe findings shed light on how many households continue to struggle with their basic finances more than seven years after the official end to the recession. Despite steady job growth during the Obama administration, wages have been slow to recover, with the typical American household still earning 2.4 percent below what they brought home in 1999, when income peaked. At the same time, costs for essentials such as housing and child care have surged faster than the rate of inflation, placing stress on household budgets.\n\nUnfortunately, unexpected expenses are far from uncommon, Bankrate.com found. About half of adults said they or a family member incurred a major expense in the last year.\n\n“It’s not a matter of if, but when an unexpected expense will pop up,” Jill Cornfield, a Bankrate.com analyst, said in a statement. “If you have a car, a house or apartment, a pet, or a kid – if you’re a member of the human race – something that costs money is bound to go wrong.”\n\nAbout four out of 10 Americans said they had enough in savings to cover a surprise $500 expense. Another 21 percent said they would rely on a credit card, while 20 percent said they’d cut back on other expenses. Another 11 percent said they’d turn to family or friends for the money.\n\nDining out is the first place where consumers would cut back, with six out of 10 respondents saying they would eat out less. The least likely expense to face the chopping block? Mobile phone plans, with the survey finding that only 35 percent said they would cut back on their wireless plans to save money.\n\nAmericans who earn more than $75,000 per year -- about a third more than the typical U.S. household earns -- report more savings on hand, although almost half said they wouldn’t be able to cover a $500 surprise expense. Millennials represent the generation most equipped to handle an emergency cost, with 47 percent saying they have enough in savings to cover one.\n\nThe findings echo research published last year by the Federal Reserve, which polled more than 5,600 Americans on their household finances. Forty-six percent of respondents said they would be challenged to come up with $400 to cover an emergency expense, and would likely borrow or sell something to afford it. When the Fed asked what types of emergency expenses Americans had actually faced in the last year, more than one out of five cited a major unexpected medical expense. The average expense: $2,782, or almost seven times higher than the Fed’s hypothetical $400 surprise bill.\n\nOther types of hardships reported by Americans included losing a job, suffering from reduced work hours or receiving a foreclosure or eviction notice.\n\n“Many Americans remain ill-prepared for such a financial disruption,” the Federal Reserve noted. “While slightly more Americans have a safety net to withstand a small financial disruption than was the case in recent years, nearly half lack the resources to easily handle such an event.”","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans-cant-afford-a-500-emergency-expense/","None"
"Exclusive: FBI agents raid headquarters of major U.S. body broker\nPORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - Federal agents have seized records from a national company that solicits thousands of Americans to donate their bodies to science each year, then profits by dissecting the parts and distributing them for use by researchers and educators.\n\nThe headquarters of MedCure, one of the nation's largest body brokers, raided by FBI agents last week conducting a search warrant, is shown outside Portland, Oregon, November 6, 2017. REUTERS/John Shiffman\n\nThe search warrant executed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at MedCure Inc headquarters here on November 1 is sealed, and the bureau and the company declined to comment on the nature of the FBI investigation. But people familiar with the matter said the inquiry concerns the manner in which MedCure distributes body parts acquired from its donors.\n\nMedCure is among the largest brokers of cadavers and body parts in the United States. From 2011 through 2015, documents obtained under public-record laws show, the company received more than 11,000 donated bodies and distributed more than 51,000 body parts to medical industry customers nationally. In a current brochure, the company says that 80,000 additional people have pledged to donate their bodies to MedCure when they die.\n\nFBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele confirmed the day-long search of the 25,000-square-foot facility, but declined to comment further because the matter is under seal. A person familiar with the matter said that FBI agents took records from MedCure but did not remove human remains.\n\nThe search warrant, though sealed, signals that an FBI investigation of MedCure has reached an advanced stage. To obtain a search warrant to seize records, rather than demand them via subpoena, FBI agents must provide a detailed affidavit to a U.S. magistrate with evidence to support probable cause that crimes have been committed and that related records may be on the premises.\n\n“MedCure is fully cooperating with the FBI, and looks forward to resolving whatever questions the government may have about their business,” said Jeffrey Edelson, a Portland attorney who represents the company. “Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we do not believe that further comment is appropriate at this time.”\n\nIt is illegal to profit from the sale of organs destined for transplant, such as hearts and kidneys. But as a Reuters series detailed last month, it is legal in most U.S. states to sell donated whole bodies or their dissected parts, such as arms and heads, for medical research, training and education.\n\nCommonly known as body brokers, these businesses often profit by targeting people too poor to afford a burial or cremation. Reuters documented how people who donate their bodies to science may be unwittingly contributing to commerce. Few states regulate the body donation industry, and those that do so have different rules, enforced with varying degrees of thoroughness. Body parts can be bought with ease in the United States. A Reuters reporter bought two heads and a spine from a Tennessee broker with just a few emails.\n\nMedCure, founded in 2005, is based outside Portland, Oregon, and has offices in Nevada, Florida, Rhode Island and Missouri, as well as Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At some locations, including the one near Portland, MedCure provides training labs for doctors and health professionals to practice surgical techniques. MedCure also sends body parts and technicians to assist with medical conferences across the country.\n\nMedCure is accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks, a national organization that primarily works with transplant tissue banks. The broker is also licensed by the state health departments in Oregon and New York, among the few states that conduct inspections. According to Oregon state health records, officials renewed MedCure’s license in January, following a routine on-site review.\n\nThe Reuters series, 'The Body Trade,' can be read here","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bodies-fbi-exclusive/exclusive-fbi-agents-raid-headquarters-of-major-u-s-body-broker-idUSKBN1D72SL","1510084735.0"
"Yemen cholera cases pass the 100,000 mark: WHO\nGENEVA (Reuters) - The number of suspected cholera cases in war-torn Yemen has risen to more than 100,000 since an outbreak began on April 27, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.\n\nThe rapid spread of the disease through 19 of Yemen’s 23 governorates highlighted a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen after two years of civil war that has disabled most health care facilities, according to the U.N. humanitarian office.\n\n“To date, 101,820 suspected cholera cases and 789 deaths have been reported in 19 governorates,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters.\n\nThe WHO has warned that the number of cases could hit 300,000, but the daily number of new ones declined slightly in the week to June 5 to 3,432, compared with 3,651 in the previous seven-day period.\n\n“Yemen is in the grip of a severe cholera epidemic of an unprecedented scale,” the U.N. humanitarian office said in a report published on Wednesday.\n\n“Malnourished children and women, people living with other chronic health conditions and households that do not have enough to eat are now at greater risk of death as they face the ‘triple threat’ of conflict, famine and cholera,” it said.\n\nThe war has left 19 million of its 28 million people needing humanitarian aid and many of them on the verge of famine. The cholera outbreak is the second wave of an epidemic that began in October, spread until December and then dwindled but was never brought fully under control.\n\nAid charity Oxfam called for a “cholera ceasefire” to allow health workers to halt the spread of the disease, adding that the published numbers were probably an underestimate.\n\n“Yemen is on the edge of an abyss. Lives hang in the balance,” Oxfam’s Yemen Country Director Sajjad Mohammed Sajid said in a statement. “Cholera is simple to treat and prevent but while the fighting continues the task is made doubly difficult.”\n\nCholera is caused by ingesting bacteria from water or food contaminated with faeces. It usually manifests itself with sudden acute diarrhea and can kill within hours, although three-quarters of infected people show no symptoms.\n\nThe short incubation period means outbreaks can spread quickly, especially in places without safe water or sanitation.\n\n“Health and sanitation workers have not been paid for over eight months, only 30 per cent of required medical supplies are being imported into the country, garbage collection in the cities is irregular, and more than eight million people lack access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation,” the U.N. report added.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-cholera-idUSKBN18Z17N","1496921781.0"
"Russia Moves to Ban Jehovah’s Witnesses as ‘Extremist’\nSeveral students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special anti-extremism unit, while Leonid Volkov, the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law.\n\nIn the case of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the group’s absolute opposition to violence, a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs, most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses, members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years, refuse military service, do not vote and view God as the only true leader. They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin, like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014.\n\nMr. Sivak, who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovah’s Witnesses elder, said he voted for Mr. Putin in 2000, three years before joining the denomination. He added that while he had not voted since, nor had he supported anti-Kremlin activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russia’s post-Soviet version of the K.G.B., the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B.\n\n“I have absolutely no interest in politics,” he said during a recent Jehovah’s Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino, a snow-covered village north of Moscow. Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long, chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible, sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“From the Russian state’s perspective, Jehovah’s Witnesses are completely separate,” said Geraldine Fagan, the author of “Believing in Russia — Religious Policy After Communism.” She added, “They don’t get involved in politics, but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation.”\n\n“The idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of — and also indifferent to — the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services,” she said.\n\nThat the worldwide headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there, Ms. Fagan added, “all adds up to a big conspiracy theory” for the increasingly assertive F.S.B.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/europe/russia-moves-to-ban-jehovahs-witnesses-as-extremist.html","1491278400.0"
"Here's why the federal government can't study gun violence\nOn the heels of the deadliest gun massacre in modern U.S. history, Republicans and Democrats alike have decried the killings and offered supportive words to the hundreds of victims in Las Vegas.\n\nWith every major mass shooting, from Sandy Hook in sleepy Newtown, Connecticut, to Pulse nightclub in Orlando, come pleas from the public for officials to do something, anything, to address the scourge of gun violence in this country.\n\nOn this case, politicians from both sides of the aisle, with the support of the NRA, have indicated they may be open to a conversation about common sense gun restrictions, including restricting 'bump stocks,' devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like automatic weapons.\n\nBut perhaps part of the reason Congress hasn't fully addressed the rising tide of shootings is that the federal government lacks basic research into which solutions work best.\n\nDickey: Why the feds don't research gun violence\n\nPassed in 1997 with the strong backing of the NRA, the so-called 'Dickey Amendment' effectively bars the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from studying firearm violence -- an epidemic the American Medical Association has since dubbed 'a public health crisis.'\n\nThe amendment, which was first tucked into an appropriations bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton, stipulates that 'none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.' A similar provision was included in the Appropriations Act of 2012.\n\nNamed for Republican Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas, a self-proclaimed 'point man for the NRA' on The Hill -- the Dickey amendment does not explicitly ban CDC research on gun violence. But along with the gun control line came a $2.6 million budget cut -- the exact amount that the agency had spent on firearm research the year prior -- and a quiet wariness.\n\nAs one doctor put it, 'Precisely what was or was not permitted under the clause was unclear ... but no federal employee was willing to risk his or her career or the agency's funding to find out.'\n\nCritics argue that the government should not try to limit the collection of scientific information, which is by nature apolitical.\n\n'Facts are facts,' Amalia Corby, the American Psychological Association's senior legislative and federal affairs officer, told ABC News. 'Public health researchers do not have a vested interest in the outcome.'\n\nBesides, experts say, non-partisan research could uncover a plethora of suggestions to help stem the tide of violence -- education strategies, guns storage solutions, etc. -- that don't include limiting access to guns.\n\n'Violence prevention researchers are invested in less violence, not fewer guns,' Corby said. 'Their end game is not to take away guns.'\n\nThough President Obama formally directed the CDC to 'the causes of gun violence and the ways to prevent it' shortly after the Newtown mass-murder in 2012, the chilling effect had already taken hold, and the CDC has consistently declined to allocate money to study the issue.\n\nIn fact, to this day, CDC policy states the agency 'interprets' the language as a prohibition on using CDC funds to research gun issues that would be used in legislative arguments 'intended to restrict or control the purchase or use of firearms.'\n\nThus, researchers remain 'afraid to even delve into that area of research because they're afraid of having their funding pulled,' Corby said.\n\nMore than a decade after Dickey passed, Congressman Dickey himself came come to regret the law he had helped push.\n\n'Firearm injuries will continue to claim far too many lives at home, at school, at work and at the movies until we start asking and answering the hard questions,' he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed shortly after the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting that killed 12 in July 2012. 'Scientific research should be conducted into preventing firearm injuries.'\n\n'I wish I had not been so reactionary,' Dickey told ABC years later.\n\nThe congressman, who remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment until his death in April, said he once worried that the CDC's 'agenda' was to take away guns. But he later joined forces with Mark Rosenberg, the former director of the CDC's gun research center, to promote academic inquiry into guns.\n\n'Scientific research... it's our responsibility,' Dickey explained. 'It's silly for us to watch this nonsense take place, without doing something.'\n\nWhy the ATF can't track guns electronically\n\nLaws govern not only the tracking of gun violence statistics, but tracking of the firearms themselves too.\n\nThe Tiahrt Amendment, first sponsored by Kansas Republican Rep. Todd Tiahrt and recently reauthorized as part of another appropriations bill, prohibits the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) from maintaining a searchable database. Instead, officers attempting to trace a gun used in the commission of a crime must use a card catalog and phone system to track the weapon.\n\nOften, officers find themselves forced to comb through boxes and boxes of paper records, many of them barely legible, by hand. The antiquated system -- which stretches the average processing time from hours to days -- cost taxpayers around $60 million over the course of 12 years, the ATF Tracing Center estimates.\n\nThough proponents say the law prevents ATF overreach and protects the second amendment by barring a gun 'registry,' critics claim that Tiahrt has 'unduly hampered' the agency from enforcing the law, according to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive , a nonprofit that tracks firearm violence across the country, there have been 275 mass shooter incidents -- defined as a shooting involving four or more victims injured or killed -- to date in 2017.\n\nIn the same time period, more than 11,700 people, including minors, died by gunshot, whether intentional or accidental, and nearly 24,000 were injured.\n\nThe CDC -- which notes that the Dickey amendment does not prohibit public health data collection -- says that firearm-related injuries are among the five leading causes of death for people ages 1-64 in the United States.\n\nThe NRA did not respond to ABC News' repeated requests for comment. The organization spent more than $3.2 million on lobbying in the first half of 2017, according to the Senate Office of Public Records' lobbying database.\n\nABC News' Lauren Pearle and Geneva Sands contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-study-gun-violence/story?id=50300379","None"

"A look at every North Korean missile test this year\nNorth Korea has conducted 14 ballistic missile tests so far in 2017.\n\nInterested in North Korea? Add North Korea as an interest to stay up to date on the latest North Korea news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHere's what to know about each of the tests that have already occurred this year.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nIn February, North Korea successfully tested a land-based KN-15 missile, a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile, which traveled 310 miles into the Sea of Japan.\n\nGen. John Hyten, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command, told a congressional panel in early April that the February launch marked a significant advancement for North Korea because it was its first successful solid-fueled missile fired from a mobile launcher.\n\nMobile-launched missiles are harder to track and can be fired at short notice.\n\nHyten labeled the launch of what is now believed to have been a KN-15 missile as “a major advancement” by North Korea because it was 'a new solid medium range ballistic missile off a new transporter erector launcher.'\n\nThe February launch occurred as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida over the weekend.\n\nPhotos taken by the club's patrons and later posted on Facebook captured Japanese and U.S. officials responding in real-time to the incident, sparking criticism about why such important meetings were not conducted in a more secure location.\n\nMarch 5\n\nIn early March, North Korea launched five medium-range Scud-er (extended range) missiles. Four traveled more than 600 miles, the upper limit of their range, into the Sea of Japan. The fifth took off, but later crashed.\n\nThree of missiles landed in waters in Japan's economic exclusion zone, which extends 200 miles from its shoreline.\n\nKCNA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nShortly after this test occurred, the U.S. delivered the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system to South Korea, a process which the U.S. started working on with its ally after the flurry of North Korean missile tests in 2016.\n\nTHAAD is a missile defense shield designed to intercept short and medium range missiles.\n\nMarch 21\n\nLater in the month, North Korea tested a mobile-launched missile which exploded 'within seconds of launch,' according to U.S. Pacific Command.\n\nThe launch was near Kalma in eastern Wonsan province, where North Korea previously attempted to test its mobile-launched Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile. Last year, North Korea test-fired eight Musudan rockets, but only one was considered a success.\n\nU.S. officials have not identified what type of missile was tested on March 21 since it exploded so soon after launch.\n\nApril 4\n\nOn April 4, a KN-17 missile launch came just days before Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, during which the pair discussed how to curb North Korea's missile and nuclear programs.\n\nThe Trump administration is hoping China will exert its economic influence over North Korea since the country controls eighty percent of all foreign trade with the reclusive regime.\n\nU.S. officials said the missile spun out of control and landed in the Sea of Japan after traveling 34 miles. It was being assessed as an in-flight failure.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson released a terse statement following Tuesday's test, saying, 'North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.'\n\nThe KN-17 is a new mobile-launched, single-stage missile that uses liquid fuel. It has not been successfully tested by North Korea, so it's difficult to assess its full range.\n\nApril 15\n\nLess than two weeks later, North Korea launched another KN-17 that exploded shortly after launch.\n\n'The launch failed very early on, so that makes it harder to know exactly what they were trying to do,' Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said days later. 'But I think that our understanding is that it was not one of the longer-range missiles that they were trying to test there; it was something like a medium-range ballistic missile.'\n\nVice President Mike Pence was briefed on the failed missile launch en route to South Korea on Air Force 2.\n\nWhile speaking with U.S. members of the military in Seoul, Pence described it as a 'provocation.'\n\n'This morning's provocation from the North is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world,' Pence said. 'Your willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear inspires our nation and inspires the world, and it's an honor for us to share this meal with you today.'\n\nApril 28\n\nNorth Korea fired a KN-17 for at least the third launch in April; this time the missile traveled 21 miles before breaking up in mid-air, according to a U.S. official.\n\nA U.S. Pacific Command spokesman noted that it was 'aware of the event' but gave no further comment in the immediate aftermath of the launch.\n\nMay 14\n\nThe U.S. believes the ballistic missile North Korea launched was a KN-17 medium range missile, not a new intermediate range missile. The launch was the first successful test of this type after several previous failures.\n\nLaunched from Kusong, in western North Korea, the missile flew for 435 miles before landing in the Sea of Japan, 60 miles from the Russian border. The Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada told reporters that the missile reached an unprecedented altitude of 2,000 kilometers (1,245 miles), which raised speculation that North Korea may have developed a new intermediate range missile. Experts claim the missile would have flown a much greater distance if launched on a maximum trajectory, perhaps reaching military bases in Guam.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nNorth Korea boasted the 'medium long-range' ballistic rocket is capable of carrying a heavy nuclear warhead, but most experts view that claim with skepticism believing the North Koreans have yet to perfect the necessary technology.\n\nThe missile was first seen publicly in a military parade in Pyongyang on April 15.\n\nMay 21\n\nOn May 21, the White House confirmed that North Korea successfully launched a medium-range ballistic missile with a shorter range than missiles in previous tests. The South Korean military said the missile traveled over 500 kilometers (just over 300 miles) into the Sea of Japan.\n\nA U.S. official told ABC News that it was a KN-15, the same solid-fueled missile tested on February 11 that can be fired at short notice.\n\nNorth Korea said shortly after the test that they were ready to mass produce medium-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching Japan and US military bases there.\n\nThis test occurred as Trump was in Saudi Arabia, the first stop on his first foreign trip as president.\n\nKCNA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMay 28\n\nOn May 28 at 10:40 p.m. Hawaii time, North Korea conducted its ninth test, a short-range ballistic missile launched from near Wonsan Airfield.\n\nThe missile was tracked for six minutes by U.S. Pacific Command before it landed in the Sea of Japan.\n\nA U.S. defense official told ABC News it appeared to be a SCUD-type missile.\n\nNorth Korea said this latest launch was aimed at testing a new precision-guidance system.\n\nJuly 4\n\nNorth Korea launched, for the first time, a two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to mark the U.S. holiday of July 4.\n\nThe missile was launched into a high-altitude trajectory of 1,730 miles and flew horizontally about 577 miles into the Sea of Japan.\n\nThe missile emerged from the north of Kusong, a city located in the far northwestern corner of North Korea, an area used for launches in the past.\n\n'The United States strongly condemns North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile,' Tillerson said in a statement. 'Testing an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region, and the world.'\n\nJuly 28\n\nThree weeks after its first ICBM launch, North Korea tested a second ICBM from Mupyong-ni, in the far north of the country, near an arms plant.\n\nIt traveled 621 miles laterally for 45 minutes and landed in the Sea of Japan, inside Japan’s Economic Exclusion Zone, about 88 nautical miles west of Hokkaido.\n\nIt marked the longest flight of a ballistic missile in North Korea's history, according to the Pentagon.\n\nAccording to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, the ICBM traveled 2,300 miles into space. Experts fear that if North Korea angled the trajectory of that missile, it could potentially travel as far as Washington, D.C., or New York.\n\nIn a statement, Trump condemned the launch, saying that North Korea's 'second such test in less than a month' is the 'latest reckless and dangerous action' by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime.\n\nU.S. officials had suspected a test could occur on July 27 to mark the North Korean holiday known as 'Day of Victory,' which celebrates the end of hostilities in the Korean War in 1953. But rainy weather at the launch location and technical difficulties appeared to have prevented a launch then.\n\nAug. 25\n\nPACOM confirmed that North Korea fired three short-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan with the first and third failing in flight. The second 'appears to have blown up almost immediately,' PACOM said.\n\nThe launches came after escalating rhetoric between Trump and Kim.\n\nOn Aug. 8, Trump threatened North Korea with 'fire and fury like the world has never seen,' touching off a war of words between the two governments.\n\nKim said he would consider sending missiles into the waters off the coast of Guam in 'mid-August.' Guam is a U.S. island territory that is home to two American military bases.\n\nBut, after reviewing those plans, Kim ultimately decided he would “watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees,' seeming to walk back an imminent threat to the island and de-escalating tensions on the Peninsula -- at least for now.\n\nAug. 28\n\nThe Pentagon and Japanese government each confirmed a North Korean missile traveled over Japan and landed in the ocean.\n\nA U.S. official later said that the missile fired was a KN-17 intermediate-range missile that flew 1,667 miles horizontally and broke apart at the end of its flight.\n\nThe flight path of a missile spurred a notification to Japanese citizens from the country's emergency alert system.\n\nIn response, Trump issued a statement that 'all options are on the table' and continued to criticize North Korea for its 'threatening and destabilizing actions.\n\nSept. 14\n\nNorth Korea launched a missile over Japanese airspace, U.S. officials confirmed.\n\nThe missile passed over Japanese airspace near Hokkaido, the same prefecture under which a KN-17 intermediate-range missile traveled on August 28.\n\nJapanese broadcaster NHK reported that the missile traveled up 478 miles high, and traveled for about 2,300 miles.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson called on “all nations” to take measures against North Korea, specifically named China and Russia.\n\n“China and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own,” Tillerson said in a statement.\n\nThis is the 14th missile test conducted by North Korea in 2017.\n\nABC News' Karma Allen, Michael Edison Hayden and Paola Chavez contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korean-missile-test-year/story?id=46592733","None"
"Boston ‘free speech’ rally ends early amid flood of counterprotesters; 27 people arrested\nBoston police said 27 people were arrested during day-long demonstrations to protest hate speech a week after a woman was killed at a Virginia white supremacist rally. (Reuters)\n\nBOSTON – Tens of thousands of counterprotesters crammed Boston Common and marched through city streets Saturday morning in efforts to drown out the planned “free speech” rally that many feared would be attended by white-supremacist groups.\n\nBy 1 p.m., the handful of rally attendees had left the Boston Common pavillion, concluding their event without planned speeches. A victorious cheer went up among the counterprotesters, as many began to leave. Hundreds of others danced in circles and sang, “Hey hey, ho ho. White supremacy has got to go.”\n\nCity officials said that at least 40,000 people participated in the counter protest, 20,000 of whom participated in a march across town. Tensions flared as police escorted some rally attendees out of the Common, prompting several physical altercations between police and counterprotesters.\n\nBoston Police Commissioner William Evans said there were 27 arrests, primarily for disorderly conduct. He said no officers or protesters were injured and there was no property damage. Evans added that three individuals were wearing ballistics vests, one of whom was later found to be armed. It is unclear if those three are among the arrests.\n\nEvans said there were three groups of people in attendance: attendees of the “free speech” rally, counter protesters, and a small group of people who showed up to cause trouble.\n\n“Overall everyone did a good job,” Evans said. “99.9 percent of people were here for the right reason, and that’s to fight bigotry.”\n\nBoston Mayor Martin J. Walsh met up with the counterprotesters at the march.\n\n“I think it’s clear today that Boston stood for peace and love, not bigotry and hate,” he said.\n\n[‘Donald Trump brought me here today’: Counterprotesters rout neo-Nazi rally in Berlin]\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised law enforcement and Mayor Marty Walsh via tweet Saturday afternoon for their handling of the crowds, saying that there appeared to be “many anti-police agitators in Boston.” More than an hour later, he tweeted support for protesters.\n\nOur great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2017\n\nI want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2017\n\nThe showdown between right-wing ralliers and the far larger group of counterprotesters in the heart of downtown Boston comes just one week after a chaotic gathering of far-right political groups — including neo-Nazis, white supremacists and Ku Klux Klan members — left dozens injured and one woman dead in Charlottesville after a reported neo-Nazi allegedly plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\nIn anticipation of potential violence, city officials corralled more than 500 police officers onto the Common, installed security cameras and constructed elaborate barriers to separate the free-speech rally from the massive demonstration in opposition to it. The handful of rally attendees gathered beneath a pavilion near the center of the Common, surrounded by metal barriers and dozens of police. Several hundred feet away, thousands of counterprotesters surrounding them carrying signs declaring “Black Lives Matter” and “Hate Has No Home In Boston,” while mockingly chanting “we can’t hear you” when it appeared the ralliers had begun to speak.\n\nOne moment of tension came when rally attendees ventured outside of the barriers and were promptly confronted by counterprotesters. One man, draped in a Donald Trump flag, was immediately surrounded by media, while demonstrators chanted at him to “go home.”\n\n[‘Shame!’: Part of Boston’s protest looked eerily like a scene from ‘Game of Thrones’]\n\nOne rally attendee, Luke St. Onge, a young man wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat and GOP T-shirt, said he came even though he knew it might be attended by white-supremacist groups, whose views he said he does not agree with.\n\n“I definitely wouldn’t associate myself with the KKK or any white supremacist. I don’t stand with them at all,” said St. Onge, who is from Las Vegas. “I do support their right to an opinion,” he added. “Free speech is definitely something I stand for.”\n\n1 of 37 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Photos from the scene of a counterprotest march and rally in Boston View Photos Thousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged on downtown Boston in a boisterous repudiation of white nationalism, dwarfing a small group of conservatives who cut short their planned “Free Speech Rally.” Caption Thousands of demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans converged on downtown Boston in a boisterous repudiation of white nationalism, dwarfing a small group of conservatives who cut short their planned “Free Speech Rally.” Aug. 19, 2017 Marchers participate in an interfaith prayer service in Boston before marching against a planned “Free Speech Rally'” on Boston Common, one week after the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nPlans for the Boston rally, which organizers said was not about white supremacy or Confederate monuments, were nearly scrapped following the violence in Charlottesville. Several speakers pulled out of or were uninvited from the event, but John Medlar, a Boston-area college student and the rally’s lead organizer, said that the rally would go on.\n\nAmong those who were scheduled to speak were Joe Biggs, formerly a writer for the conspiracy-theory website Infowars, and Kyle Chapman, a far-right activist charged with beating counterdemonstrators with a wooden pole during a clash at the University of California in Berkeley earlier this year, though it is unclear if either man attended. Members of the KKK told the Boston Herald that they expected several of the group’s members to attend, but there was little, if any, visible KKK presence at the rally.\n\n“There have been questions about why we granted a permit for the rally,” Walsh said on Friday. “The courts have made it abundantly clear. They have the right to gather, no matter how repugnant their views are. But they don’t have the right to create unsafe conditions. They have the right to free speech. In return, they have to respect our city.”\n\n“We will not be offering our platform to racism or bigotry,” organizers said in a Facebook post earlier this week. “We denounce the politics of supremacy and violence.”\n\nLast week’s gathering in Virginia was ostensibly in protest of the proposed removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. In the days since, cities across the nation have announced the removal of dozens of Confederate monuments, sparking anew the long-heated debate over what, if anything, should be done with the hundreds of statutes, streets, and schoolhouses named after or in honor of those who fought to maintain slavery.\n\n[Deconstructing the symbols and slogans spotted in Charlottesville]\n\nThousands of protesters are expected to attend rallies calling for the removal of Confederate monuments at cities across the country this weekend, including Dallas and New Orleans. Meanwhile, supporters of the Confederate monuments are also organizing, with a rally planned in Hot Springs, Ark.\n\nOrganizers in Boston said today’s gathering is not in solidarity with white nationalists, but few of those who attended the massive counterprotest believed them. Across town, thousands began gathering before 10 a.m. on Malcolm X Boulevard for a march to the Common.\n\n“We’re not standing for it. We’re not standing (for) white supremacy. We’re not going to have it in our city, not in Boston,” said Boston activist Monica Cannon, who was among those who organized the counterprotest. “We want to send a clear message that you don’t get to come to the city of Boston with your hatred.”\n\nAn estimated 40,000 people demonstrated against a rally featuring right-wing activists in Boston on Aug. 19. (Claritza Jimenez,Dalton Bennett/The Washington Post)\n\nRebecca Koskinen stood in front of her brick rowhouse on Tremont Street, awaiting the marchers, with her daughters Elle, 5, and Liv, 1. The older daughter’s sign read “I’m only five and even I know Black Lives Matter.”\n\nKoskinen said she and her husband, who are white, had taken the girls to the several other marches earlier this year and felt that it was important to show support for an event that was particularly important to people of color – especially because Elle will soon start kindergarten at a private school that is less diverse than the South End neighborhood where they live.\n\n“Because she’s not going to public school, it felt really important to me to talk about this with her and how different groups are treated,” Koskinen said.\n\nJoel Moran, a Boston resident who attended the march with his partner and a friend, said he was moved to “have my voice heard against white supremacists, against people who think that, for some reason, they have more rights than other people have.”\n\nMoran said they were “absolutely” influenced to participate today after the tragedy in Charlottesville.\n\n“It wasn’t even on my radar until last weekend,” he said. “After seeing that and having a very emotional and disturbing response to that, I feel like it’s basically my responsibility.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/08/19/thousands-expected-at-boston-free-speech-rally-and-counter-protest/","1503115200.0"
"April Fools 2017: Some of the best jokes around the world\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Despite rumours, it appears Dublin is unlikely to host the next Trump Tower\n\nOn one day of the year 'fake news' is only to be expected - and this first of April is no different.\n\nAs brands, embassies and media outlets compete to raise a chuckle with their sham announcements, here are some of 2017's best spoof stories.\n\n1. Trump buys Irish high-rise\n\nIf you believe the Irish Times, Dublin is to get its very own 'Trump Tower'. 'Trump Dublin is expected to be completed by the end of 2018,' it exclusively revealed.\n\nExtra credit should go to whoever completed the joke with a fake tweet from Donald Trump: 'Bought a small tower in Dublin, Ireland. We are going to build an awesome hotel in Dublin. It will be totally great. Love Ireland! Great country! #trumpdublin'.\n\n2. Russian hackers on demand\n\nInspired by claims that Kremlin-sponsored hackers tried to rig the US election, Russia's foreign ministry shared 'a new answering machine for Russian diplomatic missions abroad' on Facebook.\n\n'To arrange a call from a Russian diplomat to your political opponent, press 1,' the fake switchboard message suggests. Your other options? 'Press 2 to use the services of Russian hackers', or 3 'to request election interference.'\n\n3. Germany to go GMT\n\nThe scamps at the UK's German embassy tweeted that Germans would shortly vote to 'leave, or remain in' Central European Time (CET). 'A replica of the Shepherd Gate Clock in Greenwich would be placed atop the World Time Clock in Alexanderplatz, Berlin, in a frivolous symbolic gesture,' the writer deadpanned.\n\nThe clues were there for linguists, however - the surname of the 'government spokesperson' quoted - Frau Sommerzeit - translates as 'Summertime'.\n\nImage copyright Twitter / German Embassy\n\n4. Triple-decker plane\n\nEmirates airline almost had us going with the claim that it's planning to unveil a triple-decker plane. Why? Time zones. The UAE gets to 1 April before the UK and without that all-important date-stamp... could it possibly - somehow - be true?\n\nNo, is the answer. The Dubai-based carrier has not designed a plane including 'a swimming pool, games room, gym & park'. Our sympathies to the 6,800 excited people who re-tweeted that...\n\nImage copyright Twitter / Emirates\n\n5. Canine cabin crew\n\nMeanwhile in the Antipodes... Virgin Australia will be the first airline in the world to employ dogs as cabin staff, the company announced on Twitter.\n\nWhile less useful in an emergency, these little guys might have been a loveable distraction at 40,000ft.\n\nImage copyright Twitter / Virgin Australia\n\n6. Google Gnome\n\nGoogle has clearly decided April Fool's pranks don't contravene its mantra 'Don't be evil'.\n\nThe tech giant got a head-start on its comedy competitors by revealing 'Google Gnome' - a sort of do-it-all outdoor assistant - ahead of the big day.\n\n'Google Gnome is like having a tiny, little meteorologist at your beck and call,' the GoogleStore claimed.\n\nThe sullen character 'comes programmed with the ability to take charge of your backyard tools,' it enthused.\n\nOr, for the curious: 'Ask Gnome all kinds of questions, like: 'what's the difference between cirrocumulus and cumulonimbus clouds', 'why is humidity the worst', and, for windswept hair in summertime photo shoots, 'which way is the wind blowing'?'\n\nThe jokers confessed in the small print: 'Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts - for now.'\n\nImage copyright Twitter / Made by Google\n\n7. Alexa for pets\n\nNot to be outdone, Amazon breathlessly broke the news of 'Petlexa' - allegedly an animal-friendly version of its voice-activated personal assistant, Alexa.\n\n'Now your dog, cat, or favorite pet can communicate with Alexa just like you do,' the firm promised, - even including an instructional video.\n\nReader, it was all a lie.\n\n8. Attenborough does Grime\n\nThe BBC dipped a toe into the jovial April waters with a mocked-up BBC Three documentary, purportedly starring national treasure David Attenborough. The subject? Grime music.\n\nIf that seems unlikely to fool anyone, we'd like to introduce Stormzy, one of the urban genre's brightest stars, who fell for it hook, line and sinker.\n\nAccording to the man himself, he sent a savage direct message to BBC Three on Twitter, airing his views.\n\n'Public apology,' the red-faced MC confessed as the penny dropped.\n\nImage copyright Twitter / BBC Three\n\n9. Norway and Sweden aren't keen\n\nIn Scandinavia, some editors are concerned that in an era of outlandish, fact-free headlines, April Fool's Day stories could muddy the waters of truth even further.\n\nOyulf Hjertenes, editor of the Bergen Times, one of Norway's largest papers, told the BBC it was time to take the journalistic high ground instead.\n\nMagnus Karlsson, editor-in-chief at the daily Smalandsposten in Sweden, agreed. In his view, April Fool's stories could be devastating for the credibility of local newspapers in particular - a price too high to pay for a quick-fire giggle.\n\nReaders inclined to their view might enjoy the following - our favourite 'weird but true' stories from Fake News Day.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-39466693","None"
"Iran Dominates in Iraq After U.S. ‘Handed the Country Over’\nPolitical Ascendancy\n\nWhen a group of Qatari falcon hunters, “including members of the royal family, were kidnapped in 2015 while on safari in the southern deserts of Iraq, Qatar called Iran and its militia allies — not the central government in Baghdad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Mr. Abadi, the prime minister, the episode was an embarrassing demonstration of his government’s weakness at the hands of Iran, whose proxy militia Kataibb Hezbollah was believed to be behind the kidnapping.\n\nSo when the hostage negotiations were about to end, Mr. Abadi pushed back.\n\nAround noon on a day in April, a government jet from Qatar landed in Baghdad, carrying a delegation of diplomats and 500 million euros stuffed into 23 black boxes.\n\nThe hunters were soon on their way home, but the ransom did not go to the Iranian-backed militiamen who had abducted the Qataris; the cash ended up in a central bank vault in Baghdad.\n\nThe seizure of the money had been ordered by Mr. Abadi, who was furious at the prospect of militias, and their Iranian and Hezbollah benefactors, being paid so richly right under the Iraqi government’s nose.\n\n“Hundreds of millions to armed groups?” Mr. Abadi said in a public rant. “Is this acceptable?”\n\nIn Iraq, the kidnapping episode was seen as a violation of the country’s sovereignty and emblematic of Iran’s suffocating power over the Iraqi state.\n\nIn a post on Twitter, Mr. Zebari, the former finance minister, who was previously foreign minister, called the episode a “travesty.”\n\nMr. Zebari knows firsthand the power of Iran over the Iraqi state.\n\nLast year, he said, he was ousted as finance minister because Iran perceived him as being too close to the United States. The account was verified by a member of Parliament who was involved in the removal of Mr. Zebari, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Iran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Zebari, who recounted the events in an interview from his mountainside mansion in northern Iraq, said that when President Barack Obama met with Mr. Abadi last September at the United Nations, the American leader personally lobbied to save Mr. Zebari’s job. Even that was not enough.\n\nMr. Abadi now finds himself in a difficult position. If he makes any move that can be seen as confrontational toward Iran, or as positioning himself closer to the United States, it could place a cloud over his political future.\n\n“He had two options: to be with the Americans or with the Iranians,” said Izzat Shahbander, a prominent Iraqi Shiite leader who once lived in exile in Iran while Mr. Hussein was in power. “And he chose to be with the Americans.”\n\nMr. Abadi, who took office in 2014 with the support of both the United States and Iran, has seemed more emboldened to push back against Iranian pressure since President Trump took office.\n\nIn addition to seizing the ransom money, he has promoted an ambitious project for an American company to secure the highway from Baghdad to Amman, Jordan, which Iran has opposed. He has also begun discussing with the United States the terms of a deal to keep American forces behind after the Islamic State is defeated.\n\nSome are seeing an American troop commitment as a chance to revisit the 2011 withdrawal of United States forces that seemingly opened a door for Iran.\n\nWhen American officials in Iraq began the slow wind-down of the military mission there, in 2009, some diplomats in Baghdad were cautiously celebrating one achievement: Iran seemed to be on its heels, its influence in the country waning.\n\n“Over the last year, Iran has lost the strategic initiative in Iraq,” one diplomat wrote in a cable, later released by WikiLeaks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut other cables sent warnings back to Washington that were frequently voiced by Iraqi officials they spoke to: that if the Americans left, then Iran would fill the vacuum.\n\nRyan C. Crocker, the American ambassador in Iraq from 2007 to 2009, said that if the United States left again after the Islamic State was defeated, “it would be effectively just giving the Iranians a free rein.”\n\nBut many Iraqis say the Iranians already have free rein. And while the Trump administration has indicated that it will pay closer attention to Iraq as a means to counter Iran, the question is whether it is too late.\n\n“Iran is not going to sit silent and do nothing,” said Sami al-Askari, a senior Shiite politician who has good relationships with both the Iranians and Americans. “They have many means. Frankly, the Americans can’t do anything.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-iraq-iranian-power.html","1500091200.0"
"Massive cyberattack spreads ransomware across Europe, US\nA massive cyberattack that freezes computers and demands a ransom to open them has hit companies in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world today, U.S. officials and private cybersecurity analysts said.\n\nInterested in Cyberattacks? Add Cyberattacks as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Cyberattacks news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAmong the American targets are the giant Merck pharmaceutical company in New Jersey; a major multinational law firm, DLA Piper; and possibly the Mondelez food company, which produces Oreo cookies.\n\nAccording to American cybersecurity researchers, the ransomware attack used a global spam campaign to trick computer users into downloading malicious software that locks them out of their devices until they pay $300 in bitcoin. The email address where victims can confirm payment is not working, however, making recovery impossible.\n\nResearchers tell ABC News that tens of thousands of computers across multiple large organizations in at least four continents have been hit, with organizations in Russia and the Ukraine the most affected.\n\nWhile several researchers identified the virus as a derivative of the “Petya” ransomware, Kaspersky Lab, which congressional sources told ABC News is itself under FBI scrutiny, disputed that assessment, concluding that the virus was “a new ransomware that has not been seen before” and dubbing it “NotPetya.”\n\nLike the WannaCry attack in May, today’s ransomware appears to be using the hacking tools EternalBlue and DoublePulsar developed by the U.S. National Security Agency and leaked to the public by the Shadow Brokers hacker group. The virus exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows to spread quickly throughout networks with outdated security software.\n\n'Many researchers are seeing evidence that the NSA exploits are being used to propagate this,' John Bambenek of Fidelis Cybersecurity told ABC News. 'Some ineffective security defenses allowed this to happen as well.'\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Amit Serper, a researcher at the Boston-based cybersecurity firm Cybereason, tweeted that he had found a way to stop the malware using the virus’ original file name, though he cautioned it was not a “generic kill switch” like the one discovered to stop WannaCry, but only a “temporary workaround.”\n\nEarly reports indicated the virus affected major companies in Russia and Ukraine as well as the world’s largest shipping firm, Maersk, according to the affected companies and government sources.\n\nUkraine appears to have been particularly hard hit, with the country’s government reporting that some of its systems, as well as those of key institutions, including banks and telecom providers, were affected. Even radiation monitoring at the Chernobyl nuclear power station was impacted, with technicians forced to take measurements around the ruined station manually after their Windows computers were knocked out, Ukraine’s government said.\n\nMerck confirmed on Twitter that its network was infected.\n\n'We confirm our company's computer network was compromised today as part of global hack,' the company tweeted. 'Other organizations have also been affected. We are investigating the matter and will provide additional information as we learn more.'\n\nA spokesperson for DLA Piper, a global law firm with offices in Washington, D.C., confirmed that malware spread to its system, saying, “The firm, like many other reported companies, has experienced issues with some of its systems due to suspected malware. We are taking steps to remedy the issue as quickly as possible.”\n\nMondelez International, a New Jersey–based food and drink company, released a statement saying its networks were down.\n\n'The Mondelez International network is experiencing a global IT outage. Our global special situations management team is in place, and they are working to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. We will update as we have more information.”\n\nBoth the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued statements indicating that officials were aware of the attack and working to contain it.\n\n'The Department of Homeland Security is monitoring reports of cyber attacks affecting multiple global entities and is coordinating with our international and domestic cyber partners,' said the agency in a statement. 'We stand ready to support any requests for assistance. Upon request, DHS routinely provides technical analysis and support. Information shared with DHS as part of these efforts, including whether a request has been made, is confidential.'\n\n'The FBI is aware of the reported global cyber attacks and takes all potential cyber compromises seriously,' an FBI spokesperson told ABC News. 'Threat mitigation, as well as bringing the perpetrators of cyber attacks to justice, are the FBI’s top priorities.'\n\nPhotos of screens of affected computers and ATMs sent to ABC News and other media outlets showed the following message: 'If you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted. Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don’t waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service.”\n\nMaersk reported its IT systems were affected by the attack, with local media showing the same ransom message from the firm’s offices in Rotterdam, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia's state-owned energy giant Rosneft said it suffered a major attack and in a statement on Twitter said it succeeded in halting it. Workers at another oil company, Bashneft, that is owned by Rosneft, sent photos to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti showing their screens locked with the same ransom message. An analyst at IB-Group told the Russian news site RNS that at least 80 companies were affected in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIn Ukraine the virus struck the country’s government administration. Vice Prime Minister Pavlo Rozenko wrote on Facebook that the Cabinet’s office computers were all locked out. Ukraine’s central bank said a number of banks in the country were hit, as well as a state energy company. Some ATMs in the country were blocked and displayed the lock-out screen. Ordinary Ukrainians reported being unable to use some banking services. Local Ukrainian media reported that the country’s Borispol airport and national rail company were also attacked.\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Ministry, called the cyberattack the worst in the country’s history. Ukrainian officials, including a spokesperson for Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service, were quick to point fingers at Russia for the attack, though there was no evidence so far that Moscow was behind it.\n\nResearchers told ABC News that they do not believe that a nation was behind the attack and suggested that it could have been launched by a lone cybercriminal.\n\n'I think what’s happened here is someone is launching this tool to stock a bitcoin wallet and is probably just surprised at how effective it is,' said Erik Rasmussen, a former deputy prosecuting attorney and special agent with the U.S. Secret Service who now works for the cybersecurity firm Kroll. 'This attack doesn't have a specific target, so it’s likely ransomware that’s gone awry and is just really good at doing damage.'\n\nBambenek suggested that the surprise success of the virus has made its creator a top target for law enforcement.\n\n'This individual has just put himself on the top of everybody’s dinner menu,' he said.\n\nABC News’ Jack Date and Mike Levine contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/massive-cyberattack-strikes-europe/story?id=48303592","None"

"South Korea's Moon to visit China amid North Korea tensions\n(CNN) South Korean leader Moon Jae-in will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing next week, as the security situation on the Korean Peninsula continues to worsen.\n\nThe two presidents will discuss denuclearization and peace on the peninsula, Moon's spokesman Park Soo-hyun said Wednesday. This will be the third time Moon and Xi have met, with their last encounter at an Asian leaders' summit in Vietnam in November.\n\nRelations between Seoul and Beijing have been damaged by the ongoing North Korea crisis, particularly after the deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) defense system , which became fully operational in September.\n\nBeijing was strongly opposed to that deployment, set in motion by Moon's predecessor, impeached President Park Geun-hye. While Moon also voiced skepticism over the missile system before assuming power, analysts said ongoing North Korean missile testing made it difficult for him to roll back deployment.\n\nChina reacted to the roll-out with an unofficial embargo of South Korea, which hit the country's tourism industry and prompted Chinese consumers to boycott Korean brands.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they pose for a photo during a meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum in Danang, Vietnam.\n\nRough road\n\nRelations between Seoul and Beijing, though, began to improve in recent months. The two countries issued a statement in late October that recognized the 'great importance' of the bilateral relationship.\n\n'Both sides agreed that strengthening exchanges and cooperation between Korea and China would create harmony of interests in both sides, and agreed to resume exchanges and cooperation in all areas as soon as possible,' the statement said\n\nTong Zhao, fellow at the Carnegie Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, told CNN at the time that it appeared the Chinese government had decided to move past the issue, which he said had led to major losses for both countries, diplomatically and economically.\n\n'China needs a smooth relationship with South Korea in order to maintain its own geostrategic interests over the Korean Peninsula,' he said.\n\n'China has great concerns about the US alliance in the region and if China can build good relations with one of those US allies, that can work to undermine (the alliance), in some sense.'\n\nEuan Graham, director of the International Security Program at Sydney's Lowy Institute, said continued North Korean nuclear and missile testing had been pushing South Korea and the US closer together, undermining efforts by China to improve relations and increase its influence in the region ahead of the THAAD deployment.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump: Mutual commitment to denuclearize NK Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Mutual commitment to denuclearize NK 01:22\n\nKorean diplomacy\n\nUS Presidential Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that China is key to unlocking the North Korea issue.

"Trump Jerusalem move sparks Israeli-Palestinian clashes\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Israeli army fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds as Palestinian protesters burned tyres and threw stones\n\nAt least 31 Palestinians have been wounded in clashes in the Gaza Strip and across the occupied West Bank, during protests against US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nOne person is in a critical condition.\n\nMr Trump's announcement - met with worldwide dismay - reversed decades of US policy on the sensitive issue.\n\nIsrael deployed hundreds of extra troops in the West Bank as Palestinians went on strike and took to the streets.\n\nProtesters set tyres alight and threw stones, and Israeli troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets.\n\nOne rocket fired from the Gaza Strip exploded inside southern Israel while others fell short, Israel's army said.\n\nIn response, an Israeli tank and an aircraft targeted 'two terror posts' in Gaza, the army said without giving further details.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption This Palestinian man and Israeli soldier were photographed outside Damascus Gate in Jerusalem\n\nMany of Washington's closest allies have said they disagree with the move, and both the UN Security Council and the Arab League will meet in the coming days to decide their response.\n\nThere are fears the announcement could lead to a renewed outbreak of violence. The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has already called for a new intifada, or uprising.\n\nWhy did Trump reverse US policy?\n\nMr Trump announced the move on Wednesday. The US president said: 'I've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.'\n\nHe said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace\n\nDespite warnings of regional unrest over any such move, the decision fulfils a campaign promise and appeals to Mr Trump's right-wing base.\n\nRecognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was 'nothing more or less than a recognition of reality', he added. 'It is also the right thing to do.'\n\nMr Trump said the US would support a two-state solution - shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel - 'if agreed to by both sides'.\n\nThe president also refrained from using Israel's description of Jerusalem as its 'eternal and undivided capital'. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of any future Palestinian state.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was profoundly grateful to Mr Trump, who had 'bound himself forever with the history of the capital'.\n\nHe also said Israel was 'in touch with other countries to follow suit'. He did not name any of these countries, although the Philippines and the Czech Republic have been mentioned in Israeli media.\n\nThe White House said it was not aware of any countries planning to follow Mr Trump's lead.\n\nThe mood has been very different on the Palestinian side.\n\nThe leader of Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, has called for a 'day of rage' on Friday and said it should 'be the first day of the intifada against the occupier'.\n\nHamas members would be 'fully ready' to 'confront this strategic danger', Ismail Haniya said in a speech in Gaza.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said the announcement was a 'declaration of war'\n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's rival Fatah movement is seeking to protest through diplomatic means, by filing a complaint to the UN Security Council and pushing for a strong stance by the Arab League.\n\n'We are going to declare the United States disqualified as co-sponsor of any peace process or political process,' spokesman Dr Nasser Al-Kidwa said. 'In our mind, it has lost its ability to do or perform any efforts in this regard.'\n\nThere has also been widespread condemnation across the Arab and wider Muslim world, with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warning Mr Trump that he was 'throwing the region into a ring of fire'.\n\nThe leaders of the UK, France and Germany have all said they disagree with the US announcement.\n\nWhy is the announcement significant?\n\nJerusalem is of huge importance to both Israel and the Palestinians. It contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity.\n\nIsraeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv.\n\nEast Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, was annexed by Israel after the Six Day War of 1967, but before now it has not been internationally recognised as part of Israel.\n\nAccording to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42265337","None"
"'Worst view in the world': Banksy opens hotel overlooking Bethlehem wall\nThe Walled Off hotel may sound utilitarian, even bleak. Its owner says it has “the worst view of any hotel in the world”, while its 10 rooms get just 25 minutes of direct sunlight a day.\n\nBut, nestled against the controversial barrier wall separating Israel from the Palestinian territories, the West Bank’s answer to the Waldorf offers travellers something more elusive than any luxury destination.\n\nThe lodging in Bethlehem is a hotel, museum, protest and gallery all in one, packed with the artworks and angry brilliance of its owner, British street artist Banksy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Banksy’s Walled Off hotel in Bethlehem. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum for the Guardian\n\nFrom the disconcertingly lavish presidential suite where water splashes from a bullet-strafed watertank into the hot tub, to the bunk-beds in the budget room scavenged from an abandoned army barracks, the hotel is playful and strongly political.\n\nThe Walled Off Hotel by Banksy – in pictures Read more\n\nAll the rooms look out on to the concrete slabs of the wall and some have views over it to pill boxes and an Israeli settlement – illegal under international law – on the hillside beyond.\n\n“Walls are hot right now, but I was into them long before [Donald] Trump made it cool,” said Banksy in a statement. The artist, who fiercely guards his anonymity, first came to Bethlehem more than a decade ago, leaving a series of paintings on the barrier that have become a tourist destination in their own right.\n\nSince then, the town’s pilgrim and sightseeing-based economy has been ravaged by ever-tighter Israeli controls on travel between Israel and the Palestinian territories, so the new hotel is expected to provide a welcome boost in jobs and visitor numbers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bust wreathed in clouds of gas from a tear gas canister. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum for the Guardian\n\nBanksy’s reputation is likely to keep all rooms fully booked, but he wants guests to leave with more than just a selfie. “(It’s) a three-storey cure for fanaticism, with limited car parking,” he added in the statement.\n\nThe hotel opens to guests on 20 March, with bookings via the website. The team hope Israelis, who rarely see the barrier wall up close or visit Palestinian towns, will be among the guests, even though visiting means breaking the law.\n\n“I would like to invite everyone to come here, invite Israeli civilians to come visit us here,” said manager Wisam Salsaa. “We want them to learn more about us, because when they know us it will break down the stereotypes and things will change.”\n\nIsraelis are banned from visiting Bethlehem and its famous sites. And although Banksy has chosen a site officially under Israeli military control – meaning it is legal for Israelis to stay there – all the roads to reach it involve an illegal journey through Palestinian-controlled territory.\n\nThe hotel, a former pottery workshop, has a dystopian colonial theme, a nod to Britain’s role in the region’s history, the reception and tea-room a disconcerting take on a gentlemen’s club where a self-playing piano provides an eerie soundtrack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pack of cheetahs crouch over a zebra-print sofa, where entrails snake out of a cushion. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum for the Guardian\n\nThe fire flickering in the grate glows under a pile of concrete rubble, like a blaze at a bomb site, a classical bust in a niche is wreathed in clouds of gas snaking out of a tear gas canister and, in traditional seascapes, the beaches are littered with life-jackets discarded by refugees.\n\n“It’s exactly 100 years since Britain took control of Palestine and started rearranging the furniture – with chaotic results,” Banksy said. “I don’t know why, but it felt like a good time to reflect on what happens when the United Kingdom makes a huge political decision without fully comprehending the consequences.”\n\nUpstairs, original Banksy artworks decorate several of the rooms. In one, an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian protester thump each other with pillows, the feathers fluttering down towards the real pillows of the bed below.\n\nIn another, a pack of cheetahs crouch over a zebra-print sofa, where padded entrails snake out of a cushion. The bookshelves are packed with carefully chosen titles – A Room With a View at the end of one, Cage Me a Peacock on another stack.\n\nThe elevator is walled off, too, the doors jammed half open to show concrete breeze blocks, hung with an “out of service” sign.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘The worst view in the world.’ Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum for the Guardian\n\nA small museum explains the wall, the controls on movement and the troubled history of the region, curated together with Essex University professor Gavin Grindon. “If you are not completely baffled, then you don’t understand,” the presenter of a video history signs off.\n\nAlso in the building, part of a plan to promote dialogue, is a gallery showing the work of Palestinian artists. It is the first in Bethlehem, says curator Housni Alkateeb Shehada, and a way for artists, who often find it hard to travel, to reach a wider audience.\n\nHe wanted to project art on to the barrier wall which lies just five meters away, but decided in the end that it would be too risky, a reminder of the conflict and restrictions that looms over all the people living in Bethlehem. “We are very afraid,” said Shehada. “We don’t know what is going on there with the soldiers and it is forbidden.”\n\nBanksy dismissed worries that security concerns would keep people away, pointing out that he had packed out a “bemusement park” in an unglamorous English seaside town for weeks.\n\n“My accountant was worried some people will be too scared to travel to the West Bank, but then I remind him – for my last show they spent a whole day in Weston-super-Mare.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/03/banksy-opens-bethlehem-barrier-wall-hotel","1488517200.0"
"Silicon Valley siphons our data like oil. But the deepest drilling has just begun\nPersonal data is to the tech world what oil is to the fossil fuel industry. That’s why companies like Amazon and Facebook plan to dig deeper than we ever imagined\n\nWhat if a cold drink cost more on a hot day?\n\nCustomers in the UK will soon find out. Recent reports suggest that three of the country’s largest supermarket chains are rolling out surge pricing in select stores. This means that prices will rise and fall over the course of the day in response to demand. Buying lunch at lunchtime will be like ordering an Uber at rush hour.\n\nThis may sound pretty drastic, but far more radical changes are on the horizon. About a week before that report, Amazon announced its $13.7bn purchase of Whole Foods. A company that has spent its whole life killing physical retailers now owns more than 460 stores in three countries.\n\nThe acquisition – Amazon’s largest ever – struck some observers as strange. But Amazon tends to run about a decade ahead of its rivals. It owes its success to big, counterintuitive moves. This is a company that saw the power of online retail in 1994, and of cloud computing in 2006. Its purchase of Whole Foods represents a similarly far-sighted incursion into a lucrative new frontier.\n\nEnd of the checkout line: the looming crisis for American cashiers Read more\n\nAmazon isn’t abandoning online retail for brick-and-mortar. Rather, it’s planning to fuse the two. It’s going to digitize our daily lives in ways that make surge-pricing your groceries look primitive by comparison. It’s going to expand Silicon Valley’s surveillance-based business model into physical space, and make money from monitoring everything we do.\n\nSilicon Valley is an extractive industry. Its resource isn’t oil or copper, but data. Companies harvest this data by observing as much of our online activity as they can. This activity might take the form of a Facebook like, a Google search, or even how long your mouse hovers in a particular part of your screen. Alone, these traces may not be particularly meaningful. By pairing them with those of millions of others, however, companies can discover patterns that help determine what kind of person you are – and what kind of things you might buy.\n\nThese patterns are highly profitable. Silicon Valley uses them to sell you products or to sell you to advertisers. But feeding the algorithms that produce these patterns requires a steady stream of data. And while that data is certainly abundant, it’s not infinite.\n\nA hundred years ago, you could dig a hole in Texas and strike oil. Today, fossil fuel companies have to build drilling platforms many miles offshore. The tech industry faces a similar fate. Its wildcat days are over: most of the data that lies closest to the surface is already claimed. Together, Facebook and Google receive a staggering 76% of online advertising revenue in the United States.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An Amazon Go ‘smart’ store in Seattle. The company’s acquisition of Whole Foods signals a desire to fuse online surveillance with brick-and-mortar business. Photograph: Paul Gordon/Zuma Press / eyevine\n\nTo increase profits, Silicon Valley must extract more data. One method is to get people to spend more time online: build new apps, and make them as addictive as possible. Another is to get more people online. This is the motivation for Facebook’s Free Basics program, which provides a limited set of internet services for free in underdeveloped regions across the globe, in the hopes of harvesting data from the world’s poor.\n\nBut these approaches leave large reservoirs of data untapped. After all, we can only spend so much time online. Our laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables see a lot of our lives – but not quite everything. For Silicon Valley, however, anything less than total knowledge of its users represents lost revenue. Any unmonitored moment is a missed opportunity.\n\nAmazon is going to show the industry how to monitor more moments: by making corporate surveillance as deeply embedded in our physical environment as it is in our virtual one. Silicon Valley already earns vast sums of money from watching what we do online. Soon it’ll earn even more money from watching what we do offline.\n\nIt’s easy to picture how this will work, because the technology already exists. Late last year, Amazon built a “smart” grocery store in Seattle. You don’t have to wait in a checkout line to buy something – you just grab it and walk out of the store. Sensors detect what items you pick up, and you’re charged when you leave.\n\nImagine if your supermarket watched you as closely as Facebook or Google\n\nAmazon is keen to emphasize the customer benefits: nobody likes waiting in line to pay for groceries, or fumbling with one’s wallet at the register. But the same technology that automates away the checkout line will enable Amazon to track every move a customer makes.\n\nImagine if your supermarket watched you as closely as Facebook or Google does. It would know not only which items you bought, but how long you lingered in front of which products and your path through the store. This data holds valuable lessons about your personality and your preferences – lessons that Amazon will use to sell you more stuff, online and off.\n\nSupermarkets aren’t the only places these ideas will be put into practice. Surveillance can transform any physical space into a data mine. And the most data-rich environment, the one that contains the densest concentration of insights into who you are, is your home.\n\nThat’s why Amazon has aggressively promoted the Echo, a small speaker that offers a Siri-like voice-activated assistant called Alexa. Alexa can tell you the weather, read you the news, make you a to-do list, and perform any number of other tasks. It is a very good listener. It faithfully records your interactions and transmits them back to Amazon for analysis. In fact, it may be listening not only your interactions, but absolutely everything.\n\nPutting a listening device in your living room is an excellent way for Amazon to learn more about you. Another is conducting aerial surveillance of your house. In late July, Amazon obtained a patent for drones that spy on people’s homes as they make deliveries. An example included in Amazon’s patent filing is roof repair: the drone that drops a package on your doorstep might notice your roof is falling apart, and that observation could result in a recommendation for a repair service. Amazon is still testing its delivery drones. But if and when they start flying, it’s safe to assume they’ll be scraping data from the outside of our homes as diligently as the Echo does from the inside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Silicon Valley is an extractive industry. Its resource isn’t oil or copper, but data. And to increase profits, Silicon Valley must extract more. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nAmazon is likely to face some resistance as it colonizes more of our lives. People may not love the idea of their supermarkets spying on them, or every square inch of their homes being fed to an algorithm. But one should never underestimate how rapidly norms can be readjusted when capital requires it.\n\nA couple of decades ago, letting a company read your mail and observe your social interactions and track your location would strike many, if not most, as a breach of privacy. Today, these are standard, even banal, aspects of using the internet. It’s worth considering what further concessions will come to feel normal in the next 20 years, as Silicon Valley is forced to dig deeper into our lives for data.\n\nAmerica has become so anti-innovation – it's economic suicide Read more\n\nTech’s apologists will say that consumers can always opt out: if you object to a company’s practices, don’t use its services. But in our new era of monopoly capitalism, consumer choice is a meaningless concept. Companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon dominate the digital sphere – you can’t avoid them.\n\nThe only solution is political. As consumers we’re nearly powerless, but as citizens, we can demand more democratic control of our data. Data is a common good. We make it together, and we make it meaningful together, since useful patterns only emerge from collecting and analyzing large quantities of it.\n\nNo reasonable person would let the mining industry unilaterally decide how to extract and refine a resource, or where to build its mines. Yet somehow we let the tech industry make all these decisions and more, with practically no public oversight. A company that yanks copper out of an earth that belongs to everyone should be governed in everyone’s interest. So should a company that yanks data out of every crevice of our collective lives.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/23/silicon-valley-big-data-extraction-amazon-whole-foods-facebook","1503460800.0"
"Navy identifies 7 sailors killed in destroyer's collision with container ship\nThe seven sailors who were killed in a collision between a U.S. Navy ship and a merchant ship have been identified.\n\nInterested in Japan? Add Japan as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Japan news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe U.S. Navy destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine container ship off the coast of Japan in the early hours of Saturday morning local time, according to the Navy's 7th Fleet. The Fitzgerald was operating about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, Japan, when it hit the container ship at approximately 2:20 a.m. local time, according to Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin of the 7th fleet.\n\nInitially, five sailors were reported injured and seven sailors were reported missing, though the remains of those sailors have since been found.\n\n'As search and rescue crews gained access to the spaces that were damaged during the collision this morning, the missing sailors were located in the flooded berthing compartments,' the 7th Fleet said in a statement Saturday evening.\n\nThe sailors were identified as: Gunner’s Mate Seaman Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19, from Palmyra, Virginia; Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, from San Diego; Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc T Truong Huynh, 25, from Oakville, Connecticut; Gunner’s Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez, 26, from Weslaco, Texas; Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, from Chula Vista, California; Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin, 24, from Halethorpe, Maryland; and Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Leo Rehm Jr., 37, from Elyria, Ohio.\n\nCmdr. Ronald Flanders of the U.S. Naval Forces Japan said the focus right now is on the families.\n\n'An investigation will no doubt be conducted in weeks and months ahead...' he said. 'We’ve got people weeping on the pier right now.'\n\nAucoin said at a press conference Sunday that the Navy has ceased its search and rescue operation. While a U.S. official tells ABC News that seven bodies were found, Aucoin declined to confirm the number of fatalities, except to say that there were 'a number' of missing personnel. He said he was doing so out of respect for the families.\n\nEarlier, the 7th Fleet said the U.S. ship sustained damage on its starboard side and experienced flooding in some spaces.\n\nAt the press conference, Aucoin described the damage as 'extensive,' adding that there was a big puncture and gash below the waterline on one side of the ship. He also said three compartments were severely damaged.\n\n'The ship is salvageable ... [it] will require some significant repair,' Aucoin said. 'You will see the USS Fitzgerald back ... It will take months, hopefully under a year.\n\n'The water flow is tremendous, and so there wasn’t a lot of time in those spaces that were open to the sea...,' he added. 'They had to fight the ship to keep it above the surface. It was traumatic.”\n\nFour sailors and the ship's commanding officer were medically evacuated by a Japanese coast guard helicopter, according to Cmdr. Richard Gourley of the U.S. Naval Forces Japan. The 7th Fleet has since confirmed the sailors are in stable condition and are being treated for lacerations and bruises at the Naval Hospital Yokosuka.\n\nNavy Media Content Services\n\n'U.S. and Japanese support from the Navy, Maritime Self-Defense Force and Coast Guard are in the area to ensure that the sailors on USS Fitzgerald have the resources they need to stabilize their ship,' said Adm. John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, in an earlier statement.\n\n'As more information is learned, we will be sure to share it with the Fitzgerald families and when appropriate the public,' he added. 'Thank you for your well wishes and messages of concern. All of our thoughts and prayers are with the Fitzgerald crew and their families.'\n\n'Right now we are focused on two things: the safety of the ship and the well-being of the sailors,' said Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. 'We thank our Japanese partners for their assistance.'\n\nAn information center with available counselors has been set up at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka.\n\nNippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), the company that chartered the ACX Crystal, released three statements over the weekend regarding the container ship's collision with the USS Fitzgerald. The company said there were no injuries on board the ACX Crystal, and no oil spilled from the ship. It also confirmed that the ship had arrived in Tokyo Bay.\n\n'Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected,' the company said. 'NYK has established a crisis management headquarters, and fully cooperated with an investigation by the Japan Coast Guard together with the shipowner.'\n\nABC News' Rex Sakamoto contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/us-navy-ship-collides-merchant-vessel-off-coast/story?id=48092522","None"
"ISIS may be losing ground, but that doesn't mean it's gone\nJust as the U.S. military and its coalition partners have seen success in the ground fight against ISIS in its so-called caliphate, ISIS has claimed responsibility for dozens of terrorist attacks abroad this year, killing hundreds of people. As ISIS fighters flee territory they have lost in Iraq and Syria, counterterrorism experts and officials say, the next phase of ISIS-bred terrorism has begun.\n\nJust this week, a massacre at a mosque in Egypt killed more than 300 people, and eyewitnesses reported seeing dozens of attackers carrying the notorious ISIS flags at the scene. Earlier in November, ISIS-inspired suspect Sayfullo Saipov drove a truck onto a busy pedestrian and bike path on New York’s West Side Highway, killing eight people. And with the holidays approaching, ISIS propaganda sites have recently threatened to attack Christmas markets in the U.K. and France, after an attack at a Berlin Christmas market last year.\n\nThese types of attacks are unlikely to come to an end soon. “While the ISIS presence in the physical world may becoming more decentralized and diffuse, their presence in the digital world is still robust, influencing disaffected people in Europe and the U.S. to take up their cause,” said John Cohen, a former Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism coordinator who is now an ABC News consultant\n\nSTR/EPA\n\nAs ISIS adapts to losing territory, experts say, we can expect to see strategy shifts in these three key areas:\n\nISIS in the caliphate\n\nWith the fall of Raqqa in Syria, ISIS’ de facto capital, the terrorist group has been denied its so-called caliphate or state. The Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the U.S., proclaimed victory on Oct. 20, marking liberation for the city, which had been under ISIS rule since 2014. ISIS’ Iraqi capital, Mosul, fell in July. Though fighting continues in some pockets, these major victories spell the end of the conventional ground war against ISIS, according to defense officials.\n\nHowever, given the six-year civil war raging in Syria, the status quo may not last for long. Multiple parties are vying for dominance in the region, including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s Russian-backed forces and the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nGiven all the upheaval, an ISIS resurgence or the emergence of a successor organization is not an impossibility. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights recorded ISIS retaking a town from Syrian regime forces in Homs province, for example.\n\nErik De Castro/Reuters\n\nIn addition, ISIS fighters, many of them foreign fighters who were attracted to the caliphate from across the globe, attempted to escape the battle.\n\nThough the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS recommended that no ISIS fighters be allowed to leave Raqqa in the final days of the battle, coalition spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon recently told reporters that he cannot say “with a 100 percent certainty that every single fighter was identified coming out of Raqqa.”\n\nAn agreement to evacuate civilians from Raqqa to prevent civilian casualties in the final days of the fight could have presented an opportunity for some ISIS fighters to escape the city. Though the Syrian Democratic Forces set up a screening process for all males of ISIS fighting age, Dillon admitted that some fighters possibly fell through the cracks of that screening process.\n\nISIS in the US and the West\n\nIf foreign fighters did escape Raqqa, they could look to return to their homes. Counterterrorism experts say many foreign fighters went to Iraq and Syria from Europe, which remains vulnerable to attacks like those in Manchester, England; Nice, France; and Paris.\n\n“Many European Muslims integrate poorly into their broader communities, which discourages them from cooperating with intelligence and law enforcement services,” said Daniel Byman, a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, in testimony before Congress this year. Furthermore, intelligence capabilities across European nations vary. While those of some, like the United Kingdom and France, are strong, those of others, like Belgium, are underfunded and underdeveloped.\n\nAP\n\nAlthough the United States has seemed less vulnerable to attacks because of its distance from the conflict and security efforts at home, according to Byman, some experts say some of the Trump administration’s policies could alienate Muslim Americans from cooperating with the intelligence community and police.\n\nActions like Executive Order 13769, commonly referred to as the Muslim ban, “increase the allure of the Islamic State and other groups that claim that the West is at war with Islam,” Byman said.\n\nCohen warned that efforts to counter social media propaganda have often failed in the United States. “We have found that those who have carried out attacks in the name of ISIS have done so because of their own psychological conditions, rather than their adoption of the narrative,” he explained. Mental health professionals have worked with the Department of Homeland Security to identify psychologically vulnerable populations and address underlying issues and causes.\n\nNew hubs for ISIS\n\nForeign fighters who don’t return to the United States or Europe might look for areas with little to no governance or porous borders for an opportunity to regroup and resurge.\n\nCountries in central and southern Africa in particular offer safe havens because of the lack of U.S. counterterrorism presence there. Just last month, an ISIS affiliate ambushed a team of soldiers in Niger, killing four.\n\nAsmaa Waguih/Polaris\n\nLibya, Yemen, Somalia and Egypt all offer attractive possibilities, given the lack of strong governance in those countries.\n\n“What we saw in Niger and what we saw in Egypt is a harbinger of things to come — more aggressive attacks by regional extremist groups because their ranks have been filled by hardened, fully formed fighters fleeing from Iraq and Syria,” said Cohen.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-losing-ground/story?id=51418574","None"
"Police officers in two states accused of mocking Charlottesville violence\nWhite nationalists were met by counterprotesters in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, leading Gov.

"Census Finds A More Diverse America, As Whites Lag Growth\nCensus Finds A More Diverse America, As Whites Lag Growth\n\nAmerica's diversity remains on the rise, with all racial and ethnic minorities growing faster than whites from 2015 to 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau says in a new snapshot of the national population. The agency also found the U.S. median age has risen to nearly 38.\n\nAsian and mixed-race people are the two fastest-growing segments of the U.S. population, the U.S. Census Bureau says. Both groups grew by 3 percent from July 2015 to July 2016. In the same 12 months, the non-Hispanic white population grew by just 5,000 people.\n\nNon-Hispanic whites remain the only segment of the U.S. population where deaths outpace births, the agency reports.\n\n'While all other groups experienced natural increase (having more births than deaths) between 2015 and 2016,' the Census says, 'the non-Hispanic white alone group experienced a natural decrease of 163,300 nationally.'\n\nThe report adds new detail to a picture that's been coming into focus in recent years. Last summer, for instance, the Census Bureau reported a shift in America's youngest population, as babies of color outnumbered non-Hispanic white babies.\n\nNon-Hispanic whites remain the largest group of Americans, at 198 million, the Census says, followed by Hispanics at 57.5 million and blacks or African-Americans, at 46.8 million. (We'll post the full ethnic breakdown at the bottom of this story).\n\nIn its population estimates released Thursday, the Census also detailed the aging of America's population, saying the median age rose in 95 percent of American counties between 2000 and 2016. Nationally, the median age rose by more than 2.5 years, from 35.3 to 37.9, in the same period.\n\nThe U.S. median age has risen 7 percent since 2000.\n\n'Aging baby boomers will keep driving the growth in numbers of older adults in the U.S.,' NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports. 'Utah had the lowest median age, at almost 31. The county with the highest median age was Sumter County, Fla. — home to a large retirement community — where the median age was just over 67.'\n\nIn some states, the rise has been stark: the median age in Maine, for instance, is now 44.6 — six years older than in 2000. It's one of five states where the median age is 42 or above; the others are New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Florida.\n\nThe youngest median ages were in Utah (30.8) and Washington, D.C., and Alaska (both with 33.9), the Census says.\n\n[Source: U.S. Census Bureau]\n\nMaine had both the nation's highest median age and the highest percentage of non-Hispanic whites, at 93.5 percent.\n\nIn terms of national diversity, here's the Census Bureau's rundown.

"Brexit turns dirty after Theresa May dinner disaster\nLondon (CNN) It was the dinner date from hell, and the fallout has lasted for days. Devastating accounts of a meeting last week between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sent Downing Street into a tailspin from which it has struggled to recover.\n\nThe encounter -- intended to pave the way for formal Brexit talks later -- went 'badly,' the EU side said. British officials were in a 'different galaxy.' Juncker was so aghast that he called German Chancellor Angela Merkel at 7:30am the next morning. May, an anti-spin politician used to conducting such discussions with discretion, was floored.\n\nThe Prime Minister was still picking up the pieces on Tuesday. After initially dismissing the accounts as 'Brussels gossip,' May tried another tack, telling the BBC that if the EU tried to play hardball, they would find her a 'bloody difficult woman' -- recalling a Conservative Party colleague's hot-mic characterization that unintentionally boosted her credentials when she ran for the leadership of her party.\n\nThe leak is more than just gossip, of course -- it shows two sides in a difficult negotiation process very far apart, with little sense of common ground.\n\nIt suits the Prime Minister to try to rise above the leak, but by failing to deny outright the account, first reported by Politico Europe and then amplified by a full-page story in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine , she has allowed it to stand as an authoritative version.\n\nDirty fight\n\nOne lesson to be drawn from the row is that EU officials are prepared to fight dirty as the Brexit process gets underway. It is a very different kind of diplomacy and the response from Downing Street raises the question whether May is prepared to fight just as dirty to get what she wants.\n\nThe account in Frankfurter Allgemeine was so detailed it can only have been authorized by senior EU officials close to Juncker, suggesting that the commission president's circle had its gloves off before he arrived in Downing Street last Wednesday.\n\nThe way Juncker telephoned Merkel the next morning fueled the sense that, to copy a phrase used by the British prime minister last month, the rest of the EU is 'ganging up' on Britain. A few hours later, Merkel issued a stern warning against UK 'illusions' over Brexit.\n\nPresident of the European Union Jean-Claude Juncker and British Prime Minister Theresa May walk between photo calls at a summit in Malta in February.\n\nThere were rumors in Brussels that the European Council, which sets overall EU strategy and is led by Donald Tusk, were unhappy with the commission over the hostile briefing operation because it undermines trust in a delicate negotiating process.\n\nEU sources also suggested that the German Chancellor herself is not pleased at being dragged into the row by featuring so prominently in the leaked account. Fingers were being pointed at Martin Selmayr, Juncker's bruising chief of staff, as being behind the leak.\n\nThe account may undermine the trust between the two sides, but it served a useful purpose, according to Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre. He said: 'I think it was entirely to highlight how far apart the positions are between the two sides and that there is still a lot of disillusion on the British side.\n\n'We don't know for sure who leaked, but ... one of the comments from Juncker that she is in a 'different galaxy' was an attempt to express how difficult those negotiations will be.'\n\n'It is not particularly surprising that there was a leak. There is a clear difference in understanding between the two sides of how this process is going to work and what it will imply. For me that suggests there is a very good chance that we will end up with no deal at all.'\n\nEU officials were particularly taken aback at the refusal of May to accept that talks about a British-EU trade deal could not start until the so-called 'divorce' bill was settled -- something at odds with her more conciliatory tone when she triggered Article 50.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk (R) was said to have been dismayed at the reports.\n\nCharles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform, said the substance of last Wednesday's meeting was more important than the nature of the leak 'because to quote the German government, they [the British government] appear to be deluded on a range of the issues'.\n\nHe added: 'When Theresa May issued her Article 50 letter it suggested that she was adopting a more realistic approach about the painful truths of Brexit, but this suggests that May has gone off that.'\n\nGrant said that Juncker's reported comment that 'Brexit cannot be a success' may not have been very diplomatic but he was reflecting the position of the EU27 and the German government, which was that Britain must not be as prosperous outside the EU as it was inside it.\n\nHe said: 'It was a policy position. It wasn't very diplomatic but he was trying to bring the British back to reality as they are out of touch with reality on all of those issues.'\n\nMay on the back foot\n\nWhen she was Home Secretary in David Cameron's government, May was used to getting her own way. And in Brussels, there is a history of British prime ministers driving a hard bargain to get what they want: Margaret Thatcher secured a rebate for the UK from the EU, Tony Blair refused to sign up his country to the single currency.\n\nBut back then, Britain had a stronger negotiating position because it was inside the bloc -- now, as it prepares to leave Europe, its hand is weak because it has no trump card. It has nothing to trade.\n\nJUST WATCHED Brexit: What happens after Article 50? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Brexit: What happens after Article 50? 01:29\n\nAmid the fallout, May seems to be on the back foot. But some in May's Conservative Party believe it will suit the Prime Minister to be portrayed as 'in a different galaxy' to the EU because it showed she was refusing to back down on the request of the British people to withdraw from the EU.\n\nIt will certainly delight hardline Euroskeptics in the Conservative Party who would prefer no deal at all to a 'bad deal.'\n\nZuleeg echoed this view, saying the report of the dinner would be politically beneficial to May in the run-up to next month's general election . He said: 'Will this damage the size of her election victory? Probably not. In some ways it is convenient to portray her as the sole leader standing against the EU, the single fighter against the bureaucracy of other countries ganging up against Britain. In that sense there is no damage.'\n\n'Has it been damaging in terms of negotiating a deal -- to some extent, yes. But the one question for achieving a deal is whether Theresa May is willing to compromise on the very difficult red lines she has set out. If she is not willing to compromise on those then a deal looks quite unlikely.'","https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/02/europe/may-juncker-brexit-dinner-disaster/index.html","1493697600.0"
"Mogadishu truck bomb: 500 casualties in Somalia’s worst terrorist attack\nAt least 300 people killed and hundreds seriously injured in attack blamed on militant group al-Shabaab\n\nThe death toll in the bombing that hit the centre of Mogadishu on Saturday continues to rise, with more than 300 people now believed to have been killed and hundreds more seriously injured.\n\nThe scale of the loss makes the attack, which involved a truck packed with several hundred kilograms of military-grade and homemade explosives, one of the most lethal terrorist acts anywhere in the world for many years.\n\nOn Monday morning, Somalia’s information minister announced that 276 people had died in the attack with at least 300 people injured. Within hours, however, Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Amin ambulances, said his service had confirmed that 300 people died in the blast.\n\n“The death toll will still be higher because some people are still missing,” Abdirahman told Reuters.\n\nMore victims continue to be dug from the rubble spread over an area hundreds of metres wide in the centre of the city.\n\nRescue workers said a definitive death toll may never be established because the intense heat generated by the blast meant the remains of many people would not be found.\n\nOthers may have been buried quickly by relatives.\n\nThe devastating bombing, which provoked international condemnation, will focus attention on the decade-long battle against al-Shabaab, an Islamist group, in Somalia.\n\nMichael Keating, the UN special envoy to Somalia, called the attack “revolting”.\n\nThe US mission to Somalia said: “Such cowardly attacks reinvigorate the commitment of the United States to assist our Somali and African Union partners to combat the scourge of terrorism.”\n\nAl-Shabab earlier this year vowed to increase its attacks after both the Trump administration and Somalia’s recently elected president announced new military efforts against the group.\n\n\n\nOfficials said more than 110 victims of the bombing had already been buried. “One hundred and sixty of the bodies could not be recognised and so they were buried by the government [on Sunday],” Aden Nur, a doctor at the city’s Madina hospital, said. “The others were buried by their relatives. Over a hundred injured were also brought here.”\n\nCasualties included senior civil servants, five paramedic volunteers and a journalist, but most were ordinary people on one of the busiest thoroughfares of Mogadishu, which has been hit by multiple bombings in recent years.\n\nThe bomb, which is thought to have targeted Somalia’s foreign ministry, was concealed in a truck and exploded near a hotel, demolishing the building and several others.\n\nSources close to the Somali government said the truck had been stopped at a checkpoint and was about to be searched when the driver suddenly accelerated. It crashed through a barrier, then exploded. This ignited a fuel tanker parked nearby, creating a massive fireball.\n\nWitnesses described bewildered families wandering among the rubble and wrecked vehicles, looking for missing relatives. Bodies were carried from the scene on makeshift stretchers made of blankets, as people tried to dig through the debris with their hands.\n\n“There’s nothing I can say. We have lost everything,” said Zainab Sharif, a mother of four who lost her husband in the attack. She sat outside a hospital where he was pronounced dead after doctors tried for hours to save him from an arterial injury.\n\nMuna Haj, 36, said: “Today, I lost my son who was dear to me. The oppressors have taken his life away from him. I hate them. May Allah give patience to all families who lost their loved ones in that tragic blast … And I pray that one day Allah will bring his justice to the perpetrators of that evil act.”\n\nThe president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, declared three days of national mourning and joined thousands of people who responded to a plea by hospitals to donate blood for the wounded. “I am appealing to all Somali people to come forward and donate,” he said.\n\nMohamed, who took power in February, had vowed to rid the country of al-Shabaab. He has faced huge challenges, with the insurgency proving resilient to the ramped-up offensive aided by the US, and a famine.\n\nDr Mohamed Yusuf, the director of Mogadishu’s Medina hospital, said his staff had been “overwhelmed by both dead and wounded. This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past.”\n\nA Turkish air ambulance landed at Mogadishu airport on Monday morning to airlift 50 seriously injured people.\n\nAl-Shabaab, which has been affiliated to al-Qaida since 2011, has not yet claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nHowever the organisation has a history of launching bomb attacks against civilian targets in Mogadishu, and is known to avoid claiming responsibility for operations which it believes may significantly damage its public image among ordinary Somalis.\n\nThe bombing was reported on media outlets linked to al-Shabaab.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The scene of the explosion in Mogadishu. Photograph: Feisal Omar/Reuters\n\nThe information minister, Abdirahman Omar Osman, said: “It’s a sad day. This is how merciless and brutal they are, and we have to unite against them.”\n\nOne western expert working with the Somali government said the bomb was aimed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and it was likely al-Shabaab had not anticipated the destruction it would cause.\n\nAfrican governments' actions push people into extremism, study finds Read more\n\n“That it exploded next to a fuel tanker was just very, very bad luck,” the expert said.\n\nInvestigators will seek to establish the source of the military-grade explosives. One source suggested they had been stolen from Amisom, the much-criticised African Union peacekeeping mission, which has about 20,000 troops in the country.\n\nThough largely confined to the countryside since withdrawing from Mogadishu six years ago, al-Shabaab has repeatedly taken over small towns, as well as inflicting significant losses on Amisom and Somali troops.\n\nThe US military has increased drone strikes and other efforts this year against al-Shabaab, and a US special forces operative was killed in a skirmish with the group earlier this year, the first American combat casualty in Africa since the Black Hawk episode in Mogadishu in 1993.\n\nAdditional reporting by Abdullahi Mire in Mogadishu","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/truck-bomb-mogadishu-kills-people-somalia","1508040000.0"
"Stephen Fry faces blasphemy probe after God comments\nImage copyright PA\n\nPolice in the Republic of Ireland have launched an investigation after a viewer claimed comments made by Stephen Fry on a TV show were blasphemous.\n\nOfficers are understood to be examining whether the British comedian committed a criminal offence under the Defamation Act when he appeared on RTE in 2015.\n\nFry had asked why he should 'respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world.... full of injustice'.\n\nHe later said he was not 'offensive towards any particular religion'.\n\nAccording to a report in the Irish Independent newspaper, no publicised cases of blasphemy have been brought before the courts since the law was introduced in 2009 and a source said it was 'highly unlikely' that a prosecution against Fry would take place.\n\n'Such misery'\n\nAppearing on The Meaning of Life, hosted by Gay Byrne, in February 2015, Fry had been asked what he might say to God at the gates of heaven.\n\nFry said: 'How dare you create a world in which there is such misery? It's not our fault? It's not right. It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?'\n\nHe went on to say that Greek gods 'didn't present themselves as being all seeing, all wise, all beneficent', adding 'the god who created this universe, if it was created by god, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish'.\n\nThe Irish Independent reported a member of the public made a complaint to police in Ennis in the same month the programme was broadcast. He was recently contacted by a detective to say they were looking into his complaint.\n\nThe viewer was not said to be offended himself but believed Fry's comments qualified as blasphemy under the law, which carries a maximum penalty of a fine of 25,000 euros (£22,000).\n\nThe law prohibits people from publishing or uttering 'matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion'.\n\nThe government said at the time it was needed because the republic's 1937 constitution gives only Christians legal protection of their beliefs.\n\n'Absolutely astonished'\n\nFry's representatives have been contacted for a comment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2015, Fry said he had been 'absolutely astonished' by some of the reaction on social media to what he had said on the show.\n\nHe said: 'I don't think I mentioned once any particular religion and I certainly didn't intend, and in fact I know I didn't say anything offensive towards any particular religion.'\n\nA police spokeswoman told the BBC: 'We are not commenting on an ongoing investigation.'","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39830447","None"
"Operation Car Wash: The biggest corruption scandal ever?\nOn 14 January 2015, police agent Newton Ishii was waiting in Rio de Janeiro’s Galeão airport to meet the midnight flight from London. His mission was simple. A former executive of Brazil’s national oil company, Petrobras, was on the plane. Ishii was to arrest him as soon as he set foot in Brazil and take him for questioning by detectives.\n\nNo big deal, the veteran cop thought as he ticked off the hours in the shabby Terminal One lounge. This was just one of many anti-bribery operations he had worked on. Usually they made a few headlines, then faded away, leaving the perpetrators to carry on as if nothing had happened. There was a popular expression for this: acabou em pizza (to end up with pizza), which suggested that there was no political row that could not be settled over a meal and a few beers.\n\nOperation Car Wash: Is this the biggest corruption scandal in history? – podcast Read more\n\nWhen the plane finally landed, Ishii’s target was easy to identify among the passengers in the arrivals hall. Nestor Cerveró has a strikingly asymmetrical face, with his left eye set lower than the right. “He couldn’t believe it. He said I had made a mistake,” Ishii recalled later. “I told him I was just doing my job and that he could take up his complaints with the judge.”\n\nCerveró called his brother and a lawyer. He expected to be free before morning. Ishii, too, had few illusions that his suspect would be locked up for long. Decades on the force had taught him how quickly the rich and powerful could wriggle off the hook. There was little reason to think this case would be any different.\n\nAs it turned out, both men were wrong.\n\nThe investigation that led to Cerveró’s arrest – codenamed Lava Jato (Car Wash) – was about to uncover an unprecedented web of corruption. At first, the press described it as the biggest corruption scandal in the history of Brazil; then, as other countries and foreign firms were dragged in, the world. The case would go on to discover illegal payments of more than $5bn to company executives and political parties, put billionaires in jail, drag a president into court and cause irreparable damage to the finances and reputations of some of the world’s biggest companies. It would also expose a culture of systemic graft in Brazilian politics, and provoke a backlash from the establishment fierce enough to bring down one government and leave another on the brink of collapse.\n\nLaunched in March 2014, the operation had initially focused on agents known as doleiros (black market money dealers), who used small businesses, such as petrol stations and car washes, to launder the profits of crime. But police soon realised they were on to something bigger when they discovered that the doleiros were working on behalf of an executive at Petrobras, Paulo Roberto Costa, the director of refining and supply. This link led prosecutors to uncover a vast and extraordinarily intricate web of corruption. Under questioning, Costa described how he, Cerveró and other Petrobras directors had been deliberately overpaying on contracts with various companies for office construction, drilling rigs, refineries and exploration vessels. The contractors they were paying had formed an agreement to ensure they were guaranteed business on excessively lucrative terms if they agreed to channel a share of between 1% and 5% of every deal into secret slush funds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Oil executive Nestor Cerveró, whose arrest marked a turning point in the Car Wash corruption investigation. Photograph: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty\n\nAfter diverting millions of dollars into those funds, Petrobras directors then used them to funnel money to the politicians who had appointed them in the first place, and to the political parties they represented. The main objective of the racket – which fleeced taxpayers and shareholders out of billions of dollars – was to fund election campaigns to keep the governing coalition in power. But it wasn’t just politicians who benefited. Everyone connected to the deals received a bribe, in cash, or sometimes in the form of luxury cars, expensive art works, Rolex watches, $3,000 bottles of wine, yachts and helicopters. Huge sums were deposited in Swiss bank accounts, or laundered via overseas property deals or smaller companies. The means of transfer were deliberately complicated, in order to hide the money’s origins, or low-tech, to keep it off the books. Prosecutors discovered that elderly mules were flying from city to city with shrink-wrapped bricks of cash strapped to their bodies.\n\nPetrobras was no ordinary company. As well as having the highest market valuation (and the largest debts) of any corporation in Latin America, it was a flagship for an emerging economy that was trying to tap the biggest oil discovery of the 21st century – huge new oil fields in deep waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Petrobras accounted for more than an eighth of all investments in Brazil, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs in construction firms, shipyards and refineries, and forming business ties with international suppliers including Rolls-Royce and Samsung Heavy Industries.\n\nPetrobras was also at the centre of Brazil’s politics. During the 2003-2010 presidency of the Workers’ Party leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as Lula), executive posts in Petrobras were offered to Lula’s political allies, to help build support in Congress. Petrobras’s commercial and strategic importance was such that the US National Security Agency made it a target for surveillance. As the Car Wash investigation was to prove, if you could unravel the secrets of this company, you would unravel the secrets of the state.\n\nFirst, though, investigators had to get executives to talk. Until very recently, that would have been unthinkable. A culture of impunity had long reigned in Brazil. But times were changing, as Petrobras executive Nestor Cerverò was about to find out. When he saw the state of the mattress in the airport detention centre, he threw a tantrum. “How am I going to lie on this?” he said.\n\n“It’s either that or sleep standing up,” Ishii replied. Within an hour, Cerverò had dozed off, only to be shaken out of his slumber at 6am.\n\n“Where’s my breakfast?” he demanded.\n\n“You’re not getting one,” Ishii answered. “I’m taking you to Curitiba.”\n\nCuritiba, the heart of the Car Wash investigation, is the capital of the southern state of Paraná. By Brazilian standards, at 845km it is not far from Rio, but culturally, they are worlds apart. Curitiba is known as the “London of Brazil” because its people are considered more inclined to be sticklers for the rules than residents of the bigger cities in the north. In recent years, it has won international praise for its pioneering public transport system, environmental policies and hipster scene. Thanks to Operation Car Wash, however, it is now best known for its judges, prosecutors and police.\n\nWithout one simple reform, however, the investigation might never have taken off. Dilma Rousseff took over from Lula as leader of the Workers’ Party and became president of a coalition government after the 2010 election. In the wake of nationwide anti-corruption demonstrations in 2013, Rousseff had tried to placate an angry public by fast-tracking laws aimed at rooting out systemic fraud. New measures included, for the first time in Brazil, plea bargaining: prosecutors could now make deals with suspects, reducing their sentences in return for information that could lead to the arrest of more important figures.\n\nOverseeing the case in Curitiba was Sérgio Moro, an ambitious young judge who helped prosecutors put pressure on suspects by approving lengthy “preventive detentions”. In the overwhelming majority of cases, Brazilian prisoners remanded in custody before trial are poor. Moro took the unusual step of also denying bail to the rich. Ostensibly, he did so to stop them using economic or political influence to escape any charges against them. However, the pressure was on them: make a deal or stay in jail.\n\nCerveró was not the first to face this choice. He joined a parade of VIP Car Wash suspects – corporate executives, wealthy entrepreneurs and, later, even one or two powerful politicians – who spent months inside the Curitiba detention centre. They had to be kept separate from other inmates for their own safety, which meant their side of the jail quickly became overcrowded. Having lived in luxury, these super-rich prisoners were squeezed three to a one-man cell. Their new circumstances came as a shock. “One guy did not know how to shave because he had always had it done for him,” said a guard, who asked to remain anonymous. Cerveró apparently had serious problems adapting. His cellmates complained that he urinated on them in the night and washed his backside in the sink.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brazilian police officer Newton Ishii, who became a hero to many for his role in the Car Wash investigation. Photograph: Hedeson Alves/EPA\n\nIf inmates refused to cooperate with the prosecution, privileges such as TV and exercise were withdrawn. “Many suspects made deals after a visit from their loved ones,” said the guard. “I think it was because they smelled the perfume and soap of the lives they had left behind.” Some resisted for months, others just days. But almost all of them broke in the end.\n\nDefence lawyers complained, with some justification, that these tactics were legally dubious and unethical, because defendants would say or do anything to get out of jail. But polls indicated the public was delighted that the age-old problem of corruption was finally being exposed in a major nationwide operation. Almost every day, details of a dawn raid by police or another shocking allegation were splashed across the front pages: more than $2bn siphoned off Petrobras in bribes and secret payments for contract work, $3.3bn paid in bribes by the construction firm Odebrecht, more than 1,000 politicians on the take from the meat-packing firm JBS, 16 companies implicated, at least 50 congressmen accused, four former presidents under investigation.\n\nAs the staggering scale of the skulduggery emerged, many Brazilians focused their fury on politicians – initially Lula, Rousseff and others in the Workers’ Party. The newspapers trumpeted the message that the dirty socialists in Brasilia were wholly responsible for the problem. The reality was considerably less clear-cut. Just about every major party was involved in multiple, interconnected trails of corruption going back to earlier governments. And it was the Workers’ Party that had put in place the judicial reforms that allowed the investigation to go ahead. There would have been no Car Wash if the government had not appointed, in September 2013, an independent attorney general.\n\nNewspaper columnists contrasted the dirty world of politics with the high-minded work of the judiciary in the “Republic of Curitiba”. When Judge Moro walked into a restaurant, people would stand up and applaud. Graffiti on walls and banners draped from apartment balconies declared “God save Moro”. Protesters in the streets held up placards declaring “Moro for president”. The federal police also won praise. Ishii became the public face of the investigation: as the officer charged with taking suspects from the airport to the detention centre and the courthouse, he was in almost every picture and video related to the case. On social networks and in headlines, he was nicknamed Japones Bonzinho (the Good Japanese). At carnival, he was honoured with a six-metre-high doll and a samba tribute song, with lyrics imagining a suspect who wakes to find he is the latest target of Operation Car Wash: “Oh my God, I am politically dead! Knocking at my door is the Japanese fed.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carnival masks made in the likeness of Newton Ishii. Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP\n\nIn person, Ishii is circumspect and austere. When I visited him at his modest apartment in Curitiba, he was careful to downplay his role. He explained that his celebrity had reached the point where he felt trapped. At one public event, he was mobbed by adoring members of the public and had to be escorted out by security guards. A traffic cop pulled him over to ask for his autograph. Bizarrely, even the relatives of the Car Wash prisoners would ask him to share selfies and say how much they admired his work.\n\nIshii said he realised Car Wash was something special when he saw wealthy businessmen not just go to jail, but stay there. “That’s when the penny dropped. I began to think, hey, I’m in a country where there is an expression, ‘Only the poor get arrested’ – but here are these millionaires getting thrown in prison.”\n\nMore was to come. From corporate executives, Car Wash investigators turned their attention to politicians. Dishonest and venal senators and congressmen had long been protected by the immunity of office. But a window for prosecution was opening. The judiciary was in the ascendant, the electorate was mad as hell, and old loyalties were starting to crack. All the prosecutors needed was a little leverage.\n\nTo lure one of Brazil’s most powerful politicians out into the open, prosecutors planned a sting operation, using Petrobras’s Nestor Cerveró as bait. Senator Delcídio do Amaral, the Workers’ Party leader in the upper house, was an old associate of Cerveró. They had worked together at Petrobras between 2000 and 2001. After that, Cerveró had become Amaral’s faithful servant, raising illegal contributions for whichever party the fickle senator was aligned with. After Cerveró’s arrest, Amaral knew he was at risk of exposure. Desperate to find a way to discourage him from talking, Amaral arranged to meet Cerveró’s son, Bernardo, in Brasilia.\n\nOn 4 November 2015, Amaral met with Bernardo Cerveró at the Royal Tulip Hotel. Unaware that Bernardo was secretly recording the conversation, the senator made a number of incriminating statements, which were later leaked to the press. Amaral offered to pay $1m upfront, plus a further $13,000 a month, in exchange for Nestor Cerveró’s silence. When this was rebuffed, he said he could arrange Bernardo’s father’s escape from prison.\n\n“How?” Bernardo asked.\n\nFirst, Amaral explained, he would use his influence on a particular judge to arrange for Cerveró to be moved from his prison cell and placed under house arrest. Then, he described in detail how the prisoner’s electronic tag could be deactivated, so he could flee undetected. Cerveró could then charter a private plane to neighbouring Paraguay. Amaral would arrange the whole thing.\n\nAs soon as the judges heard the recording, they ordered the senator to be detained on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice. It was a momentous decision. No sitting senator had been arrested in 30 years.\n\nAmaral was taken into custody on the morning of 26 November 2015. He immediately agreed to co-operate with investigators and tell them everything he knew about the illegal activities of his fellow politicians, including the then president Rousseff, who he accused of conspiring to obstruct justice. He singled out former president Lula as the mastermind of the Petrobras corruption scheme.\n\nThe senator claimed it was Lula who had organised the payoffs and urged him to get Cerveró out of the country, because he wanted to protect a close friend who had been involved in negotiations between politicians and oil company officials. Lula and Rousseff denied the allegations and accused Amaral of lying to save himself. “I never imagined he was such a scrotum,” Jaques Wagner, Rousseff’s former chief of staff, told Lula in a phone call recorded by police. But while his critics accused him of spectacular betrayal, Amaral painted his testimony in a heroic light, saying he was doing the nation a favour by exposing the powerful to justice.\n\n“Because I was someone who was talking to the government, talking to parliament, talking with leading Brazilian businessmen, talking to Petrobras, with Eletrobras, with all the state, I had no doubt that my collaboration would be a watershed in the investigation,” Amaral told me in an interview last summer.\n\nThanks to his cooperation, Amaral was living under house arrest in his brother’s luxurious mansion in one of São Paulo’s swankiest neighbourhoods. When I arrived to meet him, a maid answered the door and led me past a pool and an outdoor jacuzzi to a private bar decorated with neon signs for Coors and Miller beer, a Wurlitzer jukebox and celebrity memorabilia: Ayrton Senna’s F1 racing helmet, Mike Tyson’s boxing glove, Buzz Aldrin’s framed autograph and Eric Clapton’s guitar.\n\nAmaral left open the possibility that he would make a return to politics. The system needed to change, he argued, because corruption had become ingrained from long before the Workers’ Party took power.\n\nBrazil’s political scene is highly vulnerable to corruption. With dozens of parties and elections at three levels (federal, state and city) across one of the world’s largest countries, campaigns are extremely expensive and it is almost impossible for any single political group to secure a majority. Gaining power involves winning elections and paying other parties to form coalitions, both of which require huge sums of money. As a result, one of the greatest prizes in Brazilian politics has long been the power to appoint senior executives at state-run companies, because each executive could expect to receive millions in kickbacks from contractors, much of which could be siphoned off into campaign coffers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Former Brazilian presidents Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nThe Workers’ Party was supposed to be different. It had been elected on a promise to clean up corruption, but it soon got sucked in. After winning the presidency on his fourth attempt, in 2002, Lula had been stuck with a minority in Congress. His chief of staff bought the support of minor parties by arranging monthly payments, known as mensalão, mostly paid by construction firms in exchange for building contracts. Although illegal, this allowed the Workers’ Party to get things done. Lula’s first term delivered impressive progress on alleviating poverty, social spending and environmental controls. None of the subsequent three Workers’ Party administrations came close to achieving as much. Unfortunately, because Lula’s reforms had only got through parliament with the aid of bribery, those achievements were built on ethical quicksand.\n\nWhen the mensalão scandal was revealed in 2004, the Workers’ Party had no choice but to stop paying its coalition partners, and Lula was again stuck with a minority in Congress. Worse, he now faced the danger of being impeached. To prevent this, he reached out to one of his party’s biggest rivals: the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), led by Michel Temer. This marriage of convenience was doomed from the start.\n\nThe PMDB is Brazil’s biggest political party, but has never taken an ideological stance or a leadership role, preferring to do deals to shore up governments. It is a mishmash of factions, ranging from conservative rural landowners and urban social democrats to evangelical nationalists and former guerrillas, whose only common ground is a desire to secure the patronage, prestige and bribes that come with government posts. The party has been involved in every corruption scandal in modern Brazilian history. But Lula was desperate, so he struck a deal. In return for support in Congress, the Workers’ Party gave Temer’s PMDB control of the international division of Petrobras and the funds that flowed from it. Cerveró, then the director of that division, was required to deliver payoffs to different masters. It was a gruelling task. In 2008, Cerveró failed to deliver sufficient funds and he was forced to stand down.\n\nTemer has been named countless times in Car Wash testimonies. Julio Camargo, a consultant for the Toyo Setal construction and engineering company, said money was channelled from Petrobras to a lobbyist representing senior PMDB figures, including Temer. One industrialist testified that Temer had arranged illicit payments into the party’s campaign coffers, and had taken leadership of the PMDB in order to control who got the millions of dollars that were being siphoned off from Petrobras, Odebrecht and their suppliers. A former Odebrecht vice president, Cláudio Melo Filho, testified that in 2014, he secretly donated 10m reais (£2.3m) to Temer’s political campaign.\n\n“This bomb could end in his lap in a more serious way than for Rousseff. He’s more involved than her,” a source said.\n\nTemer – a constitutional lawyer – publicly denied the allegations, saying suggestions of illegality were “frivolous” and “untruthful”. Despite the long list of accusations, almost none stuck. Other testimonies against him were withdrawn. No charges were filed. Prosecutors said there was not enough evidence. Temer seemed untouchable.\n\nBy the start of 2016, the economy had plunged into recession. The main cause was a collapse in global commodity prices, but the Car Wash investigation made a bad problem worse. Prosecutors had ordered Petrobras to suspend business with many of its contractors, including Odebrecht, the biggest building firm in Latin America. Projects were paralysed, workers were laid off and the unemployment rate almost doubled in the space of two years. Political activity was also paralysed. The arrest of Amaral had shaken congressmen out of the assumption that they could rely on their positions to avoid prosecution, and relations between parties became more hostile.\n\nSenator Amaral told me he had warned President Rousseff repeatedly of the dangers of pushing too far with the Car Wash investigation, but she would not listen. “She always underestimated Car Wash, because she thought it would reach everyone but her,” he recalled. “She thought it would make her stronger.”\n\nA majority of the public blamed the economic misery and political gridlock on the Workers’ Party, which had been in power for 13 years. Rousseff’s approval ratings slipped into single digits. She was even more unpopular in Congress, owing to her woeful communication skills, secretiveness and stubbornness. Several powerful senators and deputies – the Brazilian Congress has two houses, the upper Federal Senate and the lower Chamber of Deputies – were also furious that the president refused to halt the corruption investigation, or to protect senior members of her ruling coalition.\n\nThe bid to oust Rousseff as head of state was initiated in November 2015 by one of the most corrupt politicians in the country, Eduardo Cunha, in an attempt to stop or divert Car Wash. Cunha, the speaker of Brazil’s lower house, was an ally of Temer in the PMDB, with a reputation for scheming and underhand tactics. He was also a chief target of the Car Wash prosecutors. As evidence piled up through 2015, they accused him of corruption and perjury after uncovering his secret Swiss bank accounts, which contained more than $5m dollars and credit card bills bearing witness to a lavish lifestyle far beyond his declared income of $120,000. The Workers’ Party refused to protect Cunha against charges brought by the lower house ethics committee. Cunha hit back by granting one of the many impeachment requests against Rousseff. It accused Rousseff of false accounting – shifting significant funds between accounts to make government finances look better than they were. Many previous administrations had done the same thing with impunity, albeit not on such a great scale. But that was not the point. The targets of Car Wash needed a pretext on which to strike back.\n\nOn 4 March 2016, prosecutors briefly detained Lula for questioning about the Petrobras kickback scheme. There were additional allegations of influence peddling, including deals secured for Odebrecht in return for generous payments to companies owned by Lula’s relatives. Millions of anti-government protesters took to the streets a week later, on 13 March, bearing inflatable dolls of Lula in prison clothing, chanting “Fora Dilma” (Rousseff Out!), carrying banners and shaking brooms to symbolise the need for a clean sweep.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Inflatable effigies of Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at a protest in São Paulo in April 2016. Photograph: Cris Faga/CON/Latin Content/Getty\n\nLula and Rousseff had undoubtedly benefited from the corruption politically, but it is less clear – particularly in Rousseff’s case – that they had gained personally. By contrast, the hypocrisy of many of their accusers was staggering. At a parliamentary impeachment session in April, many of those who voted to eject Rousseff from office had themselves either been charged or were under investigation for far more serious crimes.\n\nIn May, as impeachment proceedings against Rousseff continued, Michel Temer became interim president, even though he was mentioned multiple times in the Car Wash investigation, along with seven members of his cabinet. Critics speculated that Temer was being protected to ensure a degree of stability during a period of turbulence. Even when Temer was found guilty in June 2016 of election violations and disqualified from running for office for eight years by a lower court judge in São Paulo, it made no difference. As interim president, he was shielded by the immunity of office. Car Wash, which had been launched to clean up corruption in the system, had ended up helping the leader of Brazil’s most notoriously self-serving party to reach the pinnacle of power.\n\nRousseff’s supporters called it a coup, though the impeachment had been approved by the largely Workers’ Party-appointed supreme court, as well as large majorities in both houses. Temer insisted the letter of the law had been followed. “Brazil has gone through a difficult period of political disputes, but the Constitution has been honoured,” the new president insisted. Soon after, however, it became clear that many of his supporters had been motivated by self-preservation rather than national salvation.\n\nBrazil president formally accused of conspiracy against corruption inquiry Read more\n\nIn Temer’s first month as president, three more of his ministers were forced to resign as a result of secretly recorded phone conversations, which confirmed Rousseff had been ousted because she would not call off the Car Wash investigation.\n\n“We have to stop this shit … We have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding,” one of the chief plotters, Romero Jucá – the PMDB leader in the upper house – told Sérgio Machado, the former president of Transpetro, Brazil’s largest oil and gas transportation company. Unknown to Jucá, the conversation was being recorded. In that call, in March 2016, Jucá revealed that he had discussed the plan with supreme court justices and military commanders: the aim was to usurp Rousseff and replace her with Temer. Jucá maintains that his words were taken out of context.\n\nBut getting the Workers’ Party out of government was only the first step in stopping Car Wash. The conspirators had another problem: Teori Zavascki, the supreme court justice overseeing the investigation, who had proved to be incorruptible.\n\n“One way (to halt the operation) is to find someone who has access to Teori, but it seems there is no one,” says Machado in the recording.\n\n“He’s closed off,” Jucá agrees.\n\nThis obstacle did not stay in place for long.\n\nDuring a thunderstorm on 19 January 2017, a Hawker Beechcraft twin-prop aircraft crashed into the ocean near Paraty, 150 miles west of Rio de Janeiro, killing all four people on board. The plane was on its way from São Paulo to Rio. It might have been seen as just another aviation accident, were it not for the fact that one of the victims was judge Teori Zavascki.\n\nThe timing and nature of the crash inevitably raised suspicions. Zavascki was in the process of reviewing numerous Car Wash testimonies that were expected to further implicate politicians in Brazil and other countries in Latin America. His family said he had received threats the previous year.\n\nInitial findings from the plane’s wreckage and the cockpit voice recorder suggested there was no mechanical failure. The pilot was experienced and had given lessons to other aircrews on how to land on the small airstrip at Paraty. But small planes have a terrible safety record in Brazil. Speculation in the media suggested that either the pilot had made a fatal misjudgment of altitude or the plane and its passengers were victims of foul play.\n\nWhatever its causes, the consequences of the crash were far-reaching. Zavascki had maintained the investigation’s credibility in the face of fierce political opposition, and he had ruled on some of its most contentious cases. On hearing news of the judge’s death, Moro said: “Without him, there would be no Operation Car Wash.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Judge Sérgio Moro, who relentlessly pursued prosecutions in the Car Wash case. Photograph: Brazil Photo Press/CON/LatinContent/Getty Images\n\nZavascki exemplified the idealistic and ultimately self-sabotaging stance of the Workers’ Party in its relationship to the justice system. After the party took power, judges, prosecutors and police were given far more scope to act. Under the previous conservative administration, the attorney general had filed away so many incomplete investigations that he was nicknamed the engavetador general (shelver-in-chief). Lula, by contrast, let prosecutors elect a new attorney general – Rodrigo Janot – who was so independent that he approved the charges against Lula, the Workers’ Party founder.\n\n“Before Lula took power, we were toothless,” said Luis Humberto, of the Federal Police union. “The Workers’ Party increased our budget, upgraded our equipment and gave us more authority. It is ironic. They lost power because they did the right thing.”\n\nTemer chose one of his close allies to replace Zavascki. Alexandre de Moraes, who was justice minister, went straight from the cabinet to the highest court. It was a clear violation of the constitutional principle of a separation of powers. Several of the senators who confirmed his appointment were ministerial colleagues – including Jucá, and the head of the upper house, Renan Calheiros – who have been charged in the Car Wash case. When a supreme court judge ordered Calheiros to step down while he was awaiting trial, Calheiros simply ignored him. Moraes, who lacked any experience as a judge, is now one of 11 supreme court justices who will hear his case.\n\nIn Congress, meanwhile, the PMDB-led ruling bloc have repeatedly attempted – so far unsuccessfully – to change the law so that testimonies resulting from plea bargains are no longer admissible in court. This would enable dozens of politicians to escape possible conviction.\n\nSo far, Car Wash investigators have resisted political pressure and expanded their list of targets. After shifting focus from Petrobras to Odebrecht, in April 2017 prosecutors opened new probes into dozens more politicians from all sides of the political spectrum, including eight members of Temer’s cabinet. They then widened their net to include JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat-packing firms. A plea bargain made on 18 May by the two brothers who own the company – Joesley and Wesley Batista – includes secret recordings allegedly made in March, in which Temer allegedly discusses hush-money payments to Cunha, and details of bribery by one of the president’s aides. The attorney general has now formally accused Temer of conspiring to obstruct Car Wash, setting the stage for a constitutional battle between the judiciary and the government and prompting calls in Congress for the impeachment of a second president in a year. Temer denies the charges.\n\nThe web of corruption has been traced far beyond Brazil’s borders. Odebrecht had a department dedicated to bribes, known as the Division of Structured Operations, which laid out close to $800m in illicit pay-offs for more than 100 contracts in a dozen countries over 15 years. Dozens of foreign corporate suppliers (of engineering equipment, power lines, drilling rigs and so forth) also face regulatory and shareholder inquiries about the bribes they paid to secure contracts with Petrobras. Among them was Rolls-Royce, which posted hefty losses as a result of penalties imposed in January this year by Brazilian, UK and US authorities. The World Cup and Olympics have also been sucked into the mire with fraud investigations now focused on six out of the 12 stadiums used in 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe investigation has shaken political and economic life and raised hopes that, for once, justice will be applied to the rich and powerful. There was a genius in the way Ishii’s arrest of Cerveró paved the way for trials of politicians. Several previously untouchable senators, congressmen and governors are now in jail, including Cunha. Powerful businessmen have also been put behind bars, including Marcelo Odebrecht, the head of the vast construction firm. Even the celebrity cop Ishii was suspended from the Car Wash investigation after he lost an appeal against an old bribery charge. More than at any time in Brazil’s recent history, there is a genuine sense that nobody is above the law, that scandals do not always have to “end in pizza”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A photograph of Michel Temer, president of Brazil, on a mock coffin during a protest in Rio de Janeiro last month. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty\n\nThe story is by no means over. Attorney general Rodrigo Janot, who is due to leave office in September, is under pressure. Mainstream parties from the left and right are lined up against the investigation. The government is trying to hamper Operation Car Wash by slashing the federal police budget by 44% and reducing the number of agents working on it. Moro must keep the public on his side as he begins a series of trials of Lula, who plans to run for president again in 2018 if he is not jailed.\n\nBrazil certainly needed to tackle corruption, which has exacerbated inequality and held back economic growth. But was Operation Car Wash worth the pain? It helped to lever the Workers’ Party out of office, and ushered in an administration that appears just as tainted, but far less willing to promote transparency and judicial independence. So many allegations are now stacked up against Temer and his allies that he will struggle to hold on to his presidency until the end of his term in 2018. Petrobras – the national champion of the Lula era – has been brought to its knees, with foreign companies allowed to control production from the new oil fields. Major companies and mainstream politicians have been utterly discredited. Voters struggle to find anyone to believe in. It is not just the establishment that is reeling, but the entire republic.\n\nIn the long term, many still hope Car Wash will ultimately make Brazil a fairer, more efficient nation, run by cleaner, law-abiding politicians. But there is also a risk that the operation will shake the country’s fragile democracy to the ground and clear the way for a rightwing evangelical theocracy or a return to rule by dictators. Whether or not this purge proves a cure for Brazil will depend not just on who falls, but on who follows.\n\nAdditional research by Shanna Hanbury and Gareth Chetwynd.

"U.S. Fugitive Eric Conn, Guilty In $550 Million Fraud, Is Captured In Honduras\nU.S. Fugitive Eric Conn, Guilty In $550 Million Fraud, Is Captured In Honduras\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Public Ministry of Honduras Public Ministry of Honduras\n\nEric Conn, the Kentucky lawyer who defrauded the Social Security system of more than half a billion dollars before fleeing the U.S. in June, has been arrested in Honduras, according to that country's Public Ministry. Wanted by the FBI, he also sent taunting messages while on the lam.\n\nConn had been under house arrest when he cut off his ankle monitor a month before his sentencing hearing and left it in a backpack along I-75 in Lexington, Ky. He was later traced to New Mexico, where a truck he had been using was found near the border. The FBI says the vehicle had been provided by a co-conspirator.\n\nConn eventually made it to Honduras, where agents of the Technical Agency for Criminal Investigation arrested him in the northern city La Ceiba, along the Caribbean coast. At the time, he was leaving a restaurant in a shopping center. Honduran officials say Conn is being sent back to the U.S. on Tuesday.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption FBI FBI\n\nKnown as 'the E-Man' in splashy ads and billboards, Conn once headed the largest Social Security law firm in Kentucky, promising to help clients get money from the government. But he was actually at the center of a corrupt group that included doctors, two federal administrative law judges and others who conspired to rig Social Security's disability benefit system, authorities said.\n\n'The negative impact of Conn's presence in our community will be felt for generations,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Amy S. Hess said this summer. 'His flight from prosecution has diminished any legitimacy and integrity he once held as an attorney and officer of the court.'\n\nMembers of the ring were indicted in April 2016 on federal charges that included conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud and making false statements. Conn entered a guilty plea in March 2017, agreeing to testify against others. But two months later, he disappeared.\n\nAfter Conn fled, federal agents spotted him in surveillance video at a gas station and at a Walmart in New Mexico, where one image showed him pushing a bicycle.\n\nFrom Louisville, Ky., member station WFPL, Eleanor Klibanoff reports that federal charges were recently lodged against Curtis Lee Wyatt, who allegedly 'bought Conn a car, tested security protocols at the U.S.-Mexico border so Conn would know what to expect and helped him escape from house arrest.'\n\nKlibanoff adds, 'The pair allegedly spent a year on the plan — twice as long as Conn managed to remain on the run.'\n\nReporting on Conn after his flight from the law this summer, Klibanoff noted that he seems to have insisted on getting in touch with people in his home community. Here's a portion of the transcript from her story:\n\n'KLIBANOFF: Bill Estep, a newspaper reporter with the Lexington Herald-Leader, started getting emails from Conn or someone who knew a lot about him. He said he'd fled to a country without an extradition treaty and provided details on his escape. Conn wanted to correct news stories, asked for unflattering mugshots to be taken down and demanded stricter sentences for his co-conspirators. 'ESTEP: I thought it was odd to — for someone who's supposedly on the run to reach out to a reporter that way. But the more I learned about him, the more I became convinced that fits with his personality. 'KLIBANOFF: Conn has also sent taunts via fax to former colleagues like Ned Pillersdorf. Pillersdorf represents Conn's former clients, 800 of whom lost their benefits as a result of the fraud. Pillersdorf says the scheme caused a crisis for whole communities in eastern Kentucky. At least two people who lost their benefits committed suicide.'\n\nOn July 12, Conn was sentenced in absentia to 12 years in prison. A federal judge also ordered him to pay nearly $170 million in restitution, along with a $50,000 fine and a forfeiture judgment of $5,750,404. That figure of some $5.7 million represents money the Social Security Administration paid to Conn.\n\nThe case got its start in late 2011, when two Social Security Administration employees filed a whistleblower lawsuit against Conn and a federal judge, David B. Daugherty — who was sentenced to four years in prison in August, for accepting more than $600,000 in bribes from Conn.\n\nDaugherty approved at least 3,149 disability cases filed by Conn, the Herald-Dispatch reports in Huntington, W.Va., where Daugherty heard disability appeals cases. The newspaper adds, 'More than 1,700 have been deemed fraudulent by government investigators.'\n\nThe Department of Justice joined the civil case against Conn and Daugherty in 2016. In a civil judgment earlier this year, Conn and his firm were ordered to pay $31 million to the government and the whistleblowers.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/05/568525847/u-s-fugitive-eric-conn-guilty-in-550-million-fraud-is-captured-in-honduras","1512450000.0"
"How two cutting edge U.S. nuclear projects bankrupted Westinghouse\nWILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2012, construction of a Georgia nuclear power plant stalled for eight months as engineers waited for the right signatures and paperwork needed to ship a section of the plant from a factory hundreds of miles away.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 site, being constructed by primary contactor Westinghouse, a business unit of Toshiba, near Waynesboro, Georgia, U.S. is seen in an aerial photo taken February 2017. Georgia Power/Handout via REUTERS\n\nThe delay, which a nuclear specialist monitoring the construction said was longer than the time required to make the section, was emblematic of the problems that plagued Westinghouse Electric Co as it tried an ambitious new approach to building nuclear power plants.\n\nThe approach - building pre-fabricated sections of the plants before sending them to the construction sites for assembly - was supposed to revolutionize the industry by making it cheaper and safer to build nuclear plants.\n\nBut Westinghouse miscalculated the time it would take, and the possible pitfalls involved, in rolling out its innovative AP1000 nuclear plants, according to a close examination by Reuters of the projects.\n\nThose problems have led to an estimated $13 billion in cost overruns and left in doubt the future of the two plants, the one in Georgia and another in South Carolina.\n\nOverwhelmed by the costs of construction, Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy on March 29, while its corporate parent, Japan’s Toshiba Corp, is close to financial ruin [L3N1HI4SD]. It has said that controls at Westinghouse were “insufficient.”\n\nThe miscalculations underscore the difficulties facing a global industry that aims to build about 160 reactors and is expected to generate around $740 billion in sales of equipment in services in the coming decade, according to nuclear industry trade groups.\n\nThe sector’s problems extend well beyond Westinghouse. France’s Areva is being restructured, in part due to delays and huge cost overruns at a nuclear plant the company is building in Finland.\n\nEven though Westinghouse’s approach of pre-fabricated plants was untested, the company offered aggressive estimates of the cost and time it would take to build its AP1000 plants in order to win future business from U.S. utility companies. It also misjudged regulatory hurdles and used a construction company that lacked experience with the rigor and demands of nuclear work, according to state and federal regulators’ reports, bankruptcy filings and interviews with current and former employees.\n\n“Fundamentally, it was an experimental project but they were under pressure to show it could be a commercially viable project, so they grossly underestimated the time and the cost and the difficulty,” said Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who has written and testified about the AP1000 design.\n\nWestinghouse spokeswoman Sarah Cassella said the company is “committed to the AP1000 power plant technology”, plans to continue construction of AP1000 plants in China and expects to bid for new plants in India and elsewhere. She declined to comment on a detailed list of questions from Reuters.\n\nPROBLEMS FROM THE START\n\nBy early 2017, the Georgia and South Carolina plants were supposed to be producing enough energy to power more than a half a million homes and businesses. Instead, they stand half-finished. (For a graphic see tmsnrt.rs/2oQEKgE)\n\nSouthern Co, which owns nearly half the Georgia project, and SCANA Corp, which owns a majority of the South Carolina project, have said they are evaluating the plants and could abandon the reactors altogether.\n\nFILE PHOTO -- Visitors look at a nuclear power plant station model by American company Westinghouse, in Le Bourget, near Paris October 14, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\n“We will continue to take every action available to us to hold Westinghouse and Toshiba accountable for their financial responsibilities under the engineering, procurement and construction agreement and the parent guarantee,” Southern said in a statement. A spokesman declined to elaborate.\n\nThe projects suffered setbacks from the start. In one instance, to prepare the Georgia plant for construction, Westinghouse and its construction partner in 2009 began digging out the foundation, removing 3.6 million cubic yards of dirt.\n\nBut half of the backfill – the material used to fill the excavated area - failed to meet regulatory approval, delaying the project by at least six months, according to William Jacobs, the nuclear specialist who monitored construction of the plant for Georgia’s utility regulator.\n\nHe declined to be interviewed.\n\nBut the source of the biggest delays can be traced to the AP1000’s innovative design and the challenges created by the untested approach to manufacturing and building reactors, according to more than a dozen interviews with former and current Westinghouse employees, nuclear experts and regulators.\n\nUnlike previous nuclear reactors, the AP1000 would be built from prefabricated parts; specialized workers at a factory would churn out sections of the reactor that would be shipped to the construction site for assembly. Westinghouse said in marketing materials this method would standardize nuclear plant construction.\n\nWestinghouse turned to Shaw Group Inc, which held a 20 percent stake in Westinghouse, to build sections for the reactors at its factory in Lake Charles, Louisiana. There, components for two reactors each in Georgia and South Carolina would be manufactured.\n\nLAKE CHARLES\n\nSeven months after work began in the May 2010, Shaw had already conducted an internal review at the behest of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to document problems it was having producing components.\n\nIn a letter to the NRC, Shaw’s then-executive vice president, Joseph Ernst, wrote: “The level and effectiveness of management oversight of daily activities was determined to be inadequate based on the quality of work.”\n\nHe laid out a laundry list of deficiencies ranging from Shaw’s inability to weed out incorrectly made parts to the way it stored construction materials.\n\nErnst did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of the American company Westinghouse is pictured at the World Nuclear Exhibition 2014, the trade fair event for the global nuclear energy sector, in Le Bourget, near Paris October 14, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nOver the next four years, regulatory and internal inspections at Lake Charles would reveal a slew of problems associated with the effort to construct modular parts to fit the new Westinghouse design, NRC records show.\n\nWhen a sub-module was dropped and damaged, Shaw managers ordered employees to cover up the incident; components were labeled improperly; required tests were neglected; and some parts’ dimensions were wrong. The NRC detailed each one in public violation notices.\n\nThen there was the missing and illegible paperwork.\n\nThe section that was delayed more than eight months by missing signatures would become one of 72 modules fused together to hold nuclear fuel. The 2.2 million pound unit was installed more than two years behind schedule.\n\nIt was not until June 2015 that the Lake Charles facility was building acceptable modules, according to a report by Jacobs. By then, Shaw had been bought by Chicago Bridge & Iron.\n\nGentry Brann, a CB&I spokeswoman, said the company put the Lake Charles plant under new management and installed new procedures after the 2013 acquisition. She said Westinghouse was to blame for subsequent delays, citing “several thousand” technical and design changes made after work had already started on various components.\n\nWestinghouse declined to comment.\n\nTHE NRC\n\nTo some extent, Westinghouse also was hamstrung by the NRC, which imposed stringent requirements for the new reactors. To comply, Westinghouse made some design changes that were tiny tweaks; others were larger.\n\nFor instance, before the NRC would issue the utilities an operating license for the Georgia plant, it demanded changes to the design of the shield building, which protects against radiation leaks. The regulator said the shield needed to be strengthened to withstand a crash by a commercial jet, a safety measure arising from the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nThe NRC issued the new standard in 2009, seven years after Westinghouse had applied for approval of its design. The company, in bankruptcy court filings, said the NRC’s demand created unanticipated engineering challenges.\n\nA spokesman for the NRC, Scott Burnell, said the changes should not have come as a surprise, since the agency had been talking about the stringent requirements for several years.\n\nWestinghouse changed its design to protect against a jet crash, but at that point the NRC questioned whether the new design could withstand tornadoes and earthquakes.\n\nWestinghouse finally met the requirements in 2011, according to a report by Jacobs.\n\nBy 2016 Westinghouse began to grasp the scope of its dilemma, according to a document filed in its bankruptcy: Finishing the two projects would require Westinghouse to spend billions of dollars on labor, abandoning them would mean billions in penalties.\n\nWestinghouse determined it could not afford either option.\n\nGraphic: Cost overruns at Westinghouse's nuclear plants - tmsnrt.rs/2qnmtML","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-accounting-westinghouse-nucle/how-two-cutting-edge-u-s-nuclear-projects-bankrupted-westinghouse-idUSKBN17Y0CQ","1493718296.0"
"Russian nuclear facility denies it is source of high radioactivity levels\nGreenpeace calls for investigation after levels of ruthenium-106 in atmosphere near Urals site found to be 986 times norm\n\nA secretive Russian nuclear facility has denied it was behind high atmospheric concentrations of the radioactive isotope ruthenium-106, after Russia’s meteorological service confirmed levels several hundred times the norm were found in several locations in the country during tests in late September.\n\nGreenpeace has called for an investigation into a potential cover-up of a nuclear accident after Russia’s nuclear agency had denied European reports of increased ruthenium-106 levels. Rosgidromet, the weather monitoring service, released test data on Monday that showed levels were indeed much higher than normal. The most potent site was Argayash in the south Urals, where levels were 986 times the norm.\n\nArgayash is about 20 miles from Mayak, a facility that reprocesses spent nuclear fuel. The plant facility issued a denial on Tuesday. “The contamination of the atmosphere with ruthenium-106 isotope registered by Rosgidromet is not linked to the activity of Mayak,” a statement said.\n\nIt went on to reassure people that the measurements were well below dangerous levels: “The measurements which Rosgidromet has released suggest that the dose people might have received is 20,000 times less than the allowed annual dose and presents no threat at all to health.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Russian workers process spent fuel from nuclear submarines at a facility in Severodvinsk. Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters\n\nNuclear experts also said there was no evidence to suggest the leak posed a significant hazard to human health or the environment.\n\n\n\nA report this month from France’s Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said ruthenium-106 had been detected in France between 27 September and 13 October.\n\n\n\nIn mid-October, the state nuclear agency Rosatom issued a statement saying that samples from across Russia during the same period showed no trace of ruthenium-106 after European agencies had reported levels that were higher than usual.\n\n\n\nGreenpeace Russia called on Rosatom to open “an in-depth inquiry and publish the results about the incidents at Mayak”, and the group also said it would ask prosecutors to look into the potential concealment of a nuclear incident.\n\n\n\nLater on Tuesday, Rosatom released a statement saying the scare had been down to a “misreading” of the data.\n\n“Rosatom categorically confirms there have been no unreported accidents or reportable events on any of its nuclear sites. It also confirms that the recent Ru-106 emission which is being reported is not linked to any Rosatom site,” the nuclear agency said.\n\nRosatom said the high readings in Argayash were still lower than those taken elsewhere in Europe, such as in Bucharest, suggesting the emission did not take place on Russian territory.\n\nNeil Hyatt, professor of nuclear materials chemistry at the University of Sheffield, said: “This isotope comes from recycling of nuclear fuel or medical isotope targets. It’s quite short-lived so that means it must be relatively young fuel. It must have come out of a reactor recently and been reprocessed recently.”\n\nRussian radiation leak: everything you need to know Read more\n\nIlya Yarmoshenko, a scientist, told a Russian news agency that the high levels of ruthenium-106 were harmless, and levels 10 times higher of other radioactive substances could be found inside normal homes. He said there was no need to evacuate any of the residents of the affected areas but added that the most important thing now was to identify the source of the radiation.\n\n\n\nHyatt agreed: “It’s certainly not a major health concern based on what we know at the moment. If it’s concentrated you would certainly want to limit access to that area. If it’s not ingested then the hazard is going to be lower.”\n\nProf Paddy Regan, a nuclear expert at the University of Surrey, said: “When they say this was 900 times the background level it’s a surprising number, but the background level is basically zero. I don’t think there’s any radiological danger from it.\n\n“The measurement of this highlights how sensitive radiation detectors are. It’s basically impossible to hide a leak. If it was a weapon explosion or a reactor leak there’d be other radioisotopes, so it looks like a leak from waste reprocessing.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Earlier this year the Mayak facility began receiving shipments of spent fuel from decommissioned nuclear submarines in the Arctic. Photograph: AP\n\nHyatt said it was unusual that other radioisotopes had not been detected as normally waste fuel would contain a mix of different nuclear materials. One possibility is that the fuel was being processed and concentrated for use in nuclear batteries, which are used in satellites.\n\n\n\n“If the plant that’s making those has sprung a leak it might explain why they’ve detected that and nothing else,” he said.\n\nEvgeny Savchenko, the top health and safety official in Chelyabinsk region, where the Mayak facility is located, dismissed health fears as “hysteria” and said the fact that the information came from abroad was suspicious, noting that France also has a nuclear fuel processing site “that competes with our Mayak”.\n\nSavchenko said there was absolutely no reason for the population to fear health effects. “Note that officials and their families don’t have injections against radiation … so you’d have to be a total fool to hide dangerous information and not take steps to save people,” he said.\n\nIn 1957 Mayak was the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history, which at the time was covered up by the Soviet regime. This year shipments of spent nuclear submarine fuel that had been left at an Arctic naval base since the Soviet period began to be shipped to Mayak, where it will be reprocessed and repurposed for use in civilian nuclear reactors. Much of the plant’s operations remain shrouded in secrecy.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/russia-radioactivity-986-times-norm-nuclear-accident-claim","1511240400.0"
"China moves to block internet VPNs from 2018\nMillions of people use the technology to circumvent China’s censorship system, known as the Great Firewall\n\nChina will completely block access to much of the global internet as part of a sweeping crackdown aimed at suppressing dissent and maintaining the Communist party’s grip on power.\n\n\n\nThe government has ordered China’s three telecommunications companies to completely block access to virtual private networks, or VPNs, by February 2018, Bloomberg News reported, citing anonymous sources. The three internet providers, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are all state-owned.\n\nThe real secret of Chinese internet censorship? Distraction | John Naughton Read more\n\nChina operates the largest internet censorship regime in the world, blocking access to thousands of websites including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Internet controls also mean news and commentary critical of the ruling Communist party and information about events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre are almost impossible to find within China.\n\nBut millions of Chinese citizens circumvent China’s censorship system, known as the Great Firewall, by using a VPN, allowing unfettered access to any website.\n\nThe latest directive comes as China prepares for a twice a decade political meeting in Beijing in late 2017, with various factions within the government jockeying for dominance in any potential shuffle of top officials. It also comes on the heels of a 14-month “cleanup” of internet services announced in January, part of president Xi Jinping’s push for so-called “internet sovereignty”.\n\n“This is a significantly escalated form of internet control and shows there is unprecedented urgency and desperation at the top of the government,” said Xiao Qiang, a professor focusing on censorship in China at the University of California, Berkeley. “This is clearly about the highest levels of political struggle and the different factions using the internet as their battlefield.\n\n“If Xi’s opponents cannot release information inside China because of the censorship apparatus, they do it outside China and then the information filters back.”\n\nXiao pointed to recent cracks in the Great Firewall, including allegations of corruption levelled by a Chinese businessman in New York that have managed to circulate widely within China. The claims, many unverified, have been seen as damaging to the head of the country’s corruption watchdog and one of Xi’s closest allies.\n\nIn the coming months Xiao predicted the authorities would step up their internet crackdown: “There have always been controls, but this will be another level”.\n\nThe ban on VPNs could also harm academics, software developers and foreign businesses. For years Chinese researchers have complained they lack adequate access to overseas journals and methods to communicate with universities around the world, while developers rely on code hosted on websites based outside China.\n\nForeign businesses in China often use VPNs to secure their company data or communicate with company headquarters. It is not clear whether the ban will affect corporate VPNs.\n\n“This is ridiculous. If they’re as interested in security and stability as they say they are, then they should leave VPNs accessible,” Kaiser Kuo, former head of international communications at Chinese tech giant Baidu, posted online.\n\n“The number of people using them in China is really small, but really vocal — and I don’t think they’ll just take this lying down. Will reflect very badly on the party. Dark days ahead.”\n\nEarlier this month a popular Chinese VPN was forced to shut down after “receiving a notice from regulatory departments”.\n\nChina has instituted bans on VPNs and other methods to bypass censorship in the past, especially during high-level government meetings in Beijing. But it remains to be seen whether the latest directive will become permanent.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/11/china-moves-to-block-internet-vpns-from-2018","1499745600.0"
"How the federal government has responded to Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria\nThe Trump administration is pushing back against criticism that the U.S. government has been slow to respond to hurricane-battered Puerto Rico.\n\n“I understand the [media] coverage in some cases is giving the appearance we are not moving fast enough,” President Donald Trump's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, told reporters outside the West Wing of the White House today.\n\n'What I will tell you is we are mobilizing and marshaling the resources of the United States of America in a way that is absolutely professional and fast and adequate to meet the needs,' Bossert added.\n\nHurricane Maria roared ashore in Puerto Rico last week, killing at least 16 people and knocking out power there. Trump announced Tuesday he will make his first visit to the island next week to survey the damage after critics -- both Democrats and Republicans -- accused his response to the devastation there of being lackluster.\n\nIn defending the federal response, administration officials told reporters today that food, water and other necessary supplies have already been delivered to the island.\n\n'We are working on bringing additional for replenishment,' said Elaine Duke, acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Secretary. 'We are using air support when we can't get through. We are cleaning the roads regularly, we have expanded greatly, probably 90 percent of the island is accessible now -- limited.'\n\nCarlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters\n\nHere's a look at the relief efforts on the ground in Puerto Rico and how the federal government has responded since the storm hit:\n\nSept. 20\n\nMaria made landfall near Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, as a major Category 4 hurricane around 6:15 a.m. ET with 155 mph winds, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was the first Category 4 storm to hit the island since 1932.\n\nMaria dumped 20 to 30 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in 24 hours.\n\nPuerto Rico's office of emergency management later confirmed that 100 percent of the U.S. territory had lost power, noting that anyone with electricity was using a generator.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Department of State told ABC News at the time that a hurricane task force is monitoring Maria's path in the Caribbean and will coordinate evacuations for American citizens and provide aid on the ground.\n\nThat night, Trump tweeted a message of support for Puerto Rico, which was reciprocated by the island's governor, Ricardo Rosello. Rossello spoke to Vice President Mike Pence by phone earlier.\n\nGovernor @RicardoRossello-\n\nWe are with you and the people of Puerto Rico. Stay safe! #PRStrong — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2017\n\nRossello imposed a curfew on the island that night from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., which has been extended indefinitely and the hours changed to 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.\n\nSept. 21\n\nSpeaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Trump said Hurricane Maria 'absolutely obliterated' Puerto Rico and 'totally destroyed' the island's power grid, but that the recovery process will begin soon with 'great gusto.'\n\nThe island “got hit with winds, they say they’ve never seen winds like this anywhere,' Trump added.\n\nSept. 22\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo departed for Puerto Rico to bring donated supplies to the island and assess the need after Puerto Rico's governor made a request for aid. Cuomo traveled with members of the National Guard as well as New York congresswoman and Puerto Rico native Nydia Velázquez.\n\nAt a press conference that afternoon, Puerto Rico's governor said water supplies on the island are lacking because of the lack of power. In addition, the water agency suffered 'severe damage,' Rossello said.\n\nSept. 26\n\nTo date, FEMA and its federal partners had provided more than 4 million meals, 6 million liters of water, 70,000 tarps and 15,000 rolls of roof sheeting to both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands since Maria made landfall. An additional 7 million meals and 4 million liters of water were being transported to the islands by barge.\n\nTen FEMA urban search and rescue task forces were conducting operations in Puerto Rico. The teams so far had rescued 557 people and five pets after combing through more than 2,600 structures.\n\nMeanwhile, the American Red Cross had mobilized 9,000 comfort kits as well as several thousand tarps, flashlights, batteries, blankets and hand sanitizer to Puerto Rico.\n\nAn emergency response team from the U.S. Department of Energy arrived in Puerto Rico to conduct damage assessments and assist the island in restoring power to 'critical facilities,' including hospitals, airports, shelters and water treatment facilities. Electricity was restored to Centro Médico Hospital in San Juan and San Pablo Hospital in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, according to FEMA\n\nThe energy department was also working to facilitate fuel deliveries across Puerto Rico for generators at these critical facilities and response efforts. To date, more than 4.6 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve had been delivered to areas, including Puerto Rico, impacted by hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, according to FEMA.\n\nErika P. Rodriguez/The New York Times via Redux\n\nWith at least 5,600 personnel deployed to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the U.S. Department of Defense announced it had conducted at least eight medical evacuations at the time.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it had deployed 300 people to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and 'additional medical professionals' were 'available as needed.'\n\nMoreover, assessments conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers showed an estimated 30,000 roofs are damaged in Puerto Rico. Power assessments remained underway at critical facilities while surveys across the island are determining the state of routes for debris removal, according to FEMA.\n\nBut many residents told The Associated Press they were still waiting for help from anyone from the federal or Puerto Rican government.\n\n'People say FEMA is going to help us,' Maribel Valentin Espino said as she showed reporters around the sopping wet wreckage of her home in northern Puerto Rico. 'We're waiting,' she said.\n\nSept. 27\n\nFollowing a request from the governor of Puerto Rico, Trump said his administration was 'thinking about' waiving the Jones Act, a century-old law that requires all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried on U.S. owned-and-operated vessels.\n\nMeanwhile, Rossello continued his calls for action from Congress in the wake of the hurricane while speaking from Camp Santiago on the Puerto Rico National Guard base in the hard-hit town of Salinas. Federal and local officials will have reached all towns in Puerto Rico by the end of the day or next. Still, funds from the Puerto Rican government are running low, he said.\n\n'This is without a doubt a catastrophe, and it needs to be treated as such,' Rossello told reporters, calling Maria 'probably the single biggest hurricane catastrophe in the history of the U.S.”\n\nJust 4 percent of Puerto Rico had electricity at that time, most of which is concentrated around hospitals, and 80 percent of telecommunications were still down, while only 52 percent of the island had safe drinking water, according to Rossello.\n\nCarolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times/Polaris\n\nAmid pleas for more help on the ground, U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Richard C. Kim arrived in Puerto Rico to take charge of the humanitarian assistance mission there and to coordinate recovery efforts with authorities.\n\nThe American Maritime Partnership, the voice of the U.S. domestic maritime industry, issued a statement saying it was 'actively working' with the federal government and relief organizations 'to deploy quickly and deliver essential goods like food, fuel, first aid supplies and building materials.' Domestic maritime companies had already moved approximately 9,500 containers of goods in Puerto Rico.\n\n'A steady stream of additional supplies keeps arriving in Puerto Rico on American vessels and on international ships from around the world. The problem now is distributing supplies from Puerto Rico’s ports inland by surface transportation,” said Thomas Allegretti, chairman of the American Maritime Partnership, said in a statement.\n\nSept. 28\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced the president has authorized that shipping restrictions, via the Jones Act, be waived immediately for the island. The move is intended to expedite the delivery of needed relief supplies there.\n\nAt @ricardorossello request, @POTUS has authorized the Jones Act be waived for Puerto Rico. It will go into effect immediately. — Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) September 28, 2017\n\nOnce it's signed, the waiver will be in effect for 10 days and covers all products being shipped to Puerto Rico, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“This waiver will ensure that over the next 10 days, all options are available to move and distribute goods to the people of Puerto Rico,' acting Secretary Duke said in a statement. 'It is intended to ensure we have enough fuel and commodities to support lifesaving efforts, respond to the storm, and restore critical services and critical infrastructure operations in the wake of these devastating storms.'\n\nJones Act vessels can carry more than 4,000 containers of goods to Puerto Rico per week, according to the American Maritime Partnership.\n\nCarlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters\n\nAs of 8 a.m., the U.S. Department of Defense said its teams had completed 47 of 69 of hospital assessments, delivered fuel to nine hospitals and provided 900 super sandbags to shore up a damaged dam in Puerto Rico.\n\nThat afternoon, the defense department said it has four scheduled flights to deliver power generation capabilities, medical supplies, contingency response units, communications support, as well as assisting with commodity distribution in Puerto Rico.\n\nABC News' Erin Dooley, Joshua Hoyos, Alexander Mallin, Elizabeth McLaughlin and Eva Pilgrim contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-government-responded-puerto-rico-hurricane-maria/story?id=50152714","None"

As a likely result, only about 32 ransom payments had been attempted by late Tuesday afternoon — not all of them successfully — totaling about US$8,000, according to the address' public account record.\n\nThe downside is that anyone who tries to pay can't get their files decrypted because the hackers have no way to communicate with victims to provide the decryption key.\n\nDespite the Ukranian focus of the initial attack, researchers said they think that it's unlikely that the attack is state-sponsored.\n\nRelated: Paying Off 'Petya-Variant' Ransomware Won't Unlock Your Files\n\n'A state actor won't specifically use an exploit that is already distributed.

According to a U.S. government security bulletin reviewed by NBC News, it uses methods that once came from a National Security Agency database of cyber exploits and is more difficult to defeat than WannaCry.\n\nWhile WannaCry victims had to take action to download malicious software via email, Tuesday's victims became infected silently.

'This has no kill switch, and it looks like they had a development budget.'\n\nMeanwhile, law enforcement agencies strongly urged victims not to try to pay the ransom, which Europol warned only 'proves to the cybercriminals that ransomware is effective.'\n\n'As a result, cybercriminals will continue their activity and look for new ways to exploit systems that result in more infections and more money on their accounts,' it said.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/cyberattack-hits-oil-giant-banks-russia-ukraine-n777161","None"

'We are opposed to his positions on the climate crisis, his international politics against migrants, his sexist speeches and behavior, his Islamophobia and racist remarks, his military plans around the world and his neo-liberalism and capitalism.'\n\nOn Bastille Day itself, there will be a march titled 'Don't Let Your Guard Down Against Trump' that starts from the Place de Clichy.\n\nAccording to organizers, 'an American contingent' will be part of the demonstrations.\n\nThe U.S. president should be no stranger to Europeans protesting his visits. During the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, last week, there were violent clashes between demonstrators and police.\n\nMany of the protesters singled out Trump as the object of their disquiet.\n\nTrump is unpopular across most of Europe. In France, 86 percent of people have 'no confidence' in him to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs, according to a study by the Pew Research Center last month.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/bastille-day-french-anti-trump-protesters-plan-no-trump-zone-n781626","None"
"'I'd Like To See You Hold Back On Settlements,' Trump Tells Netanyahu\n'I'd Like To See You Hold Back On Settlements,' Trump Tells Netanyahu\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWith differing messages emanating from the Trump administration about its stance on the two-state solution for in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, many eyes turned to President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for clarity on the issue at their joint news conference at the White House Wednesday.\n\nYouTube\n\n'So I'm looking at two-state and one-state — and I like the one that both parties like,' Trump said when asked about the subject alongside Netanyahu at the formal news conference around midday Wednesday.\n\n'I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one,' Trump continued. 'I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two, but honestly if Bibi and if the Palestinians — if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.'\n\nIn the Israeli leader's response to the same question, Netanyahu said he was concerned with substance, not labels. And he said his two main requirements for a peace deal haven't changed.\n\n'First, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state. They have to stop calling for Israel's destruction,' Netanyahu said.\n\nSecondly, he added, 'in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River.'\n\nEarlier, when Trump was asked for his view of Israel's settlement activities, he responded by pivoting to look at his Israeli counterpart and saying, 'I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made.'\n\nAfter Netanyahu offered a short reply to that statement — 'Let's try it,' he seemed to say, as he waved a hand — Trump said, 'Doesn't sound too optimistic, but he's a good negotiator.'\n\nThe two leaders spoke shortly after Netanyahu arrived at the White House with his wife, Sara. The news conference kicked off a series of joint events for Trump and Netanyahu, ranging from a private meeting to a bilateral session and a working lunch.\n\nLast night, remarks by senior White House officials seemed to signal a possible shift in the long-held U.S. view that a two-state solution is integral to peace negotiations, with an official describing the idea as something that should be left up to the two main parties in the talks.\n\n'A two-state solution that doesn't bring peace is not a goal that anybody wants to achieve,' the official said. 'Peace is the goal, whether it comes in the form of a two-state solution if that's what the parties want or something else, if that's what the parties want, we're going to help them.'\n\nThat message about the possibility of creating an independent Palestinian state differed from the U.S. message that was relayed to Palestinian leaders this week.\n\nOn the eve of the White House meeting with Israel's leader, CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah — where the American intelligence chief relayed 'reassuring messages about the two-state solution' to the Palestinians, according to Israeli news site Haaretz, citing a source familiar with the meeting.\n\nTrump has said he wants to restart peace talks between the two sides — something that hasn't happened in more than two years.\n\n'He said he wants to put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of brokering what he's called 'the ultimate deal,'' NPR's Scott Horsley reports on Morning Edition.\n\nBut, Scott adds, some Israelis are wary of entering a new round of negotiations.\n\nIn response to reports from Washington about the views of senior officials, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry issued a statement Wednesday declaring that if the reports are accurate, the 'Trump administration's withdrawal from adopting the two state-solution, will mark Netanyahu's instant success that will strengthen his position.'\n\nWhile saying that they would await word from Trump and Netanyahu's official appearance at the White House, the Palestinian ministry also stated that it 'will seek a broader international front to preserve the two-state solution,' citing the possible involvement of the European Union.\n\nOne month ago, U.S. officials joined diplomats from some 70 nations to affirm the importance of a two-state solution at a summit held in Paris. The summit did not include leaders from Israel or the Palestinian Authority.\n\n'President Trump has very much indicated that he wants to achieve peace,' a senior White House official said in the background briefing on Netanyahu's visit.\n\nThe official also stated, 'We're not going to dictate what the terms of peace will be.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/15/515391997/as-trump-and-netanyahu-meet-palestinians-watch-for-talk-of-two-state-plan","1487134800.0"
"How America's Idea Of Illegal Immigration Doesn't Always Match Reality\nHow America's Idea Of Illegal Immigration Doesn't Always Match Reality\n\nWhen you think of illegal immigration in the U.S., do you picture a border crosser or a visa overstayer? A family or a single person? A farmworker or a waiter?\n\nPeople living in the U.S. without legal status are frequently invoked in American politics — especially in recent months. But the conversation is often short on facts about the millions of people who fall into this category.\n\nThere are, however, outdated beliefs: A Pew Research Center survey in 2015 found that very few Americans are aware of recent changes in immigration patterns.\n\nAnd, of course, there are stereotypes, which often don't always match up with reality. Most people in the U.S. illegally have been here for years, for instance, and people working service jobs far outnumber migrant farm labor.\n\nHere's a look at the actual statistics about people living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nWe should note that there are a few caveats about this data. Different research groups use different methodologies, and in some cases, they rely on estimates. We've included links to all our data sources so you can read about their methods in more detail.\n\nAbout 11 million people live in the U.S. without authorization\n\nThere are far more naturalized citizens than unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., and slightly more green card holders, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe total number of people living in the country illegally — about 11 million — has made headlines recently, because immigration advocates suggest that under the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies, almost all of them could be targeted for deportation. (More than 700,000 'DREAMers' — immigrants who were brought into the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas as children — are still temporarily protected from deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.)\n\nLongtime residents outnumber new arrivals\n\nA large majority of those people currently living in the U.S. illegally have been here for a decade or longer, which is a major shift from the situation at the turn of the millennium.\n\nAbout two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. for 10 years or more, Pew says. Only 14 percent arrived within the past five years.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the number of new arrivals was far higher, and the share of longtime residents far lower.\n\nMexicans make up a dominant — but declining — share of this population\n\nMexico is 'the leading nation of origin for U.S. unauthorized immigrants,' Pew writes, but the share of immigrants from Mexico is also declining.\n\nThat is to say, Mexican immigrants are a shrinking majority of the population living in the country through illegal immigration.\n\nOf people living in the U.S. illegally, more than half are from Mexico. The population from that one country far outnumbers the population from entire continents. But there are fewer people of Mexican origin living in the U.S. now than there were a decade ago.\n\nYou can see the trend lines clearly if you look just at people arriving in the U.S. illegally, instead of the millions who live here. The percentage arriving from Mexico has dropped markedly, while more immigrants are coming from Africa, Central America and Asia.\n\nThe reasons for the shifting immigration patterns are complex. For Central American immigrants, conflicts in their home countries certainly play a role. The Migration Policy Institute suggests that there might be similar reasons for increased migration from Asia and Africa.\n\n'As European countries have tightened migration restrictions after record inflows of asylum seekers and migrants in 2015, some Africans and Asians fleeing conflict and poverty appear to be flying to Latin American countries with relatively lenient visa policies, such as Ecuador, Brazil, and Cuba, then turning to established regional migration networks,' the Migration Policy Institute writes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants entered with valid visas\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has estimated that as of Jan. 4, 2016, about 416,500 people overstayed their visas in fiscal year 2015. That's less than 1 percent of visa holders who entered the U.S. during that period.\n\nStill, it's unclear how many visa overstayers make up the total number of unauthorized immigrants. A Pew estimate from 2006 says it could be as high as 45 percent. A recent study by the Center for Migration Studies estimates that two-thirds of those who joined the unauthorized immigrant population in 2014 were visa overstayers.\n\nWhy's it so hard to nail down the details? In part, it's because the data released last year are the first numbers on visa overstays that the government has released in more than two decades.\n\nFederal law requires the Department of Homeland Security to report how many people come into the U.S. and stay after their visas expire. But the government has been having trouble collecting that data for years, as a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found.\n\nThe way airports and other ports of entry are currently set up makes it difficult to keep track of when a traveler leaves the U.S. The department has been piloting new programs to identify airport travelers by scanning their faces and irises.\n\nWithout historical data, it's hard to measure trends. But the estimates for fiscal year 2015 do show that Canadians made up the majority of visa overstays.\n\n61 percent of unauthorized immigrants live in 20 metro areas — but most live in the suburbs, not the city\n\nIf you're a person living in the U.S. illegally, odds are you can be found in one of a few big cities and their surrounding suburbs.\n\nSixty-one percent of this population lives in 20 metropolitan areas, such as New York, Los Angeles and Houston, Pew reports. That's very different from the stats for the U.S. as a whole — just 36 percent of the overall population live in those areas.\n\nBut 'metropolitan' doesn't mean 'urban,' and most people living there illegally reside in the suburbs instead of the city proper. (The only exception to that rule is Phoenix.)\n\nThat can pose a challenge for city governments that want to take a stand on immigration issues, as NPR's Richard Gonzalez reported last month:\n\n'Many big city mayors have promised to resist President Trump's threat to cut off federal funds to sanctuary cities. But the fact that most of the unauthorized immigrants live outside of city limits might complicate a mayor's ability to protect them, according to William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. 'He told the Chicago Tribune, 'This may raise questions of whether or not the sanctuary status is an umbrella one that covers the whole region.' '\n\nMost are working in service and construction jobs\n\nYou probably know that people living in the U.S. without legal status, as well as other immigrants, are a big part of the farm labor force.\n\nThat's why the farm industry and farmworkers have been keenly concerned about Trump's rhetoric and policies on immigration.\n\nBut there just aren't very many farming jobs in the U.S., overall. So farming is not a common industry for the 11 million — only 4 percent of people living here illegally work in agriculture.\n\nFar, far more work in service jobs or in construction.\n\nMany have children who are U.S. citizens\n\nAccording to the Migration Policy Institute, one-third of people who are age 15 or older and staying in the U.S. without authorization live with at least one child under the age of 18 who is a U.S. citizen. That's far more than the number who live only with noncitizen children — that's just 6 percent of the population.\n\nJennifer Van Hook, a demographer at Penn State University who studies immigration, points out that this statistic shows that deportations affect more than just unauthorized immigrants.\n\n'When these people leave the country, who's going to take care of their children? It's likely that some of those U.S.-born children will be accompanying their parents,' she says.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's attempt to temporarily shield these parents of U.S. citizens from deportation through Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents — also known as DAPA — has never been implemented, and the future of the effort is unclear.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/08/517561046/how-americas-idea-of-illegal-immigration-doesnt-always-match-reality","1488949200.0"
"NYC terror suspect seems to have been prepared to die in attack, source says\nThe 27-year-old man who allegedly set off an explosive in the New York City subway system this morning seemed to have been prepared to die as a suicide bomber, a law enforcement source said.\n\nInterested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27, told authorities he is self-inspired from ISIS online propaganda, sources said. He said no one directed him to carry out the attack, a law enforcement said, adding that the suspect talked about the plight of Muslims over the years.\n\nTLC\n\nUllah did not specifically say why he chose Times Square but indicated to authorities that ISIS and al-Qaeda propaganda mentioned Times Square as a possible venue for an attack. Ullah said he read al-Qaeda’s online magazine “Inspire” and used instructions from the internet to build the explosive.\n\nUllah was badly injured in the arm and torso from the explosive device that went off in his arms, sources said, and he has been hospitalized.\n\nFive people were treated for minor injuries and have since been released, officials said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called it an 'attempted terrorist attack.'\n\nJason Szenes/EPA\n\nUllah, originally from Bangladesh, entered the United States seven years ago on a family-based visa and has an address in Brooklyn, sources said, adding that he works as an electrician.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, Ullah held a for-hire vehicle license, which allows a driver to operate a black car, livery cab or limousine, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission said. The license lapsed in March 2015 and was not renewed.\n\nBefore the device detonated at about 7:20 a.m. in a subway passageway between Times Square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Ullah wore the explosive strapped to him while he took the subway from Brooklyn into Manhattan, a law enforcement source said.\n\nAt 6:25 a.m., Ullah boarded the F train at the 18th Avenue station in Borough Park, the law enforcement source said. He then switched to the A at Jay Street and arrived at the 42nd Street/Port Authority station shortly before 7:20 a.m.\n\nMatthew Diebel/USA TODAY\n\nAlex Klimov\n\nThe explosive device had been assembled in the suspect's apartment, sources said.\n\nA law enforcement source said the bomb was built from a 12-inch-long pipe, black powder and rigged with a 9-volt battery and a wire that came from a Christmas light. Because it was strapped to the suspect, the assumption is he had been prepared to die a suicide bomber, the source said. The pipe had nails stuffed into it, the source said, and it had the ability to impose more injuries than it did.\n\n“This could have been worse,” a law enforcement source told ABC News.\n\nHowever, the pipe did not fully shatter and a 6-inch piece was discovered fully intact.\n\nABC\n\nABC\n\nUllah is not expected to be charged this evening but eventually is set to face terror-related federal charges, a law enforcement source said.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/nyc-explosion-suspect-made-statements-indicating-supports-isis/story?id=51718097","None"

"White lawmaker warns black attorney she may ‘go missing’ if Confederate statues are threatened\nProtests over Confederate symbols have erupted in several cities, following white nationalist violence in Charlottesville on Aug. 12. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\n\nLaDawn Jones is a black Democrat from Atlanta. For four years, her seatmate in the Georgia House of Representatives was Jason Spencer, a white Republican from the southern tip of the state. They see the world differently and, she concedes, there were many conversations where “we’ve had to walk away from each other because the debate was so intense.”\n\nThose debates didn’t end when Jones left the legislature to resume practicing law last year — they were still frenemies on social media. And this week, the pair got into an online scuffle in which some say Spencer made a violent, racist threat.\n\nIt involved two of the most emotionally volatile issues in the American South: Confederate monuments and lynching.\n\nThe discussion started when Spencer posted a picture of himself next to a memorial of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Jones, who has advocated for removing Confederate memorials from the state’s most vaunted places, posted a comment warning her former colleague that he should “get it in … before it is torn down.”\n\nIt soured from there.\n\nThe lowest point was when Spencer told her that if she and others kept up their fight to rid the state of Confederate monuments, “I cant guarantee you won’t be met with torches but something a lot more definitive.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Jason Spencer (Georgia House of Representatives).\n\nLater, removing any doubt, he said the people who want the statues gone “will go missing in the Okefenokee,” referring to a swamp and national wildlife refuge near his home town. “To many necks they are red around here. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”\n\nThe entire thread (it has some profanity, harsh language and an epic “Game of Thrones” reference) was posted online by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nAt one point, Jones told Spencer to “put your hoods and your tiki torches away. We are no longer afraid. We will not let you hide behind your heritage … Lock those photos in your memory because we are about tear that s— down! #byefelicia #byeStonewall #byeLee”\n\nSpencer replied “Hate for others and American history (good and bad) drives your quixotic journey to erase history like the Bolsheviks. Looks like you are afflicted with the same poison you claim to fight against.”\n\nSpencer’s office did not immediately respond to an email message from The Washington Post seeking comment.\n\nHe told the Journal-Constitution that his words weren’t a threat, but a “warning to of how people can behave about this issue.”\n\n“She is from Atlanta — and the rest of Georgia sees this issue very differently,” Spencer told the newspaper. “Just trying to keep her safe if she decided to come down and raise hell about the memorial in the back yards of folks who will see this as an unwelcome aggression from the left.”\n\nAccording to the Journal-Constitution, Spencer asked that the newspaper include a picture in the story of him standing next to a monument of Martin Luther King Jr. that was unveiled on the Georgia capitol grounds.\n\nJones said that while she thinks her former colleague’s comments “absolutely and completely crossed the line, I personally did not feel threatened.”\n\n[Should Confederate monuments come down? Here’s what South Africa did after apartheid.]\n\nThere may be people in the state willing to get violent over Confederate monuments, she said, but she doesn’t think her former seatmate is one of them, even if they are diametrically opposed when it comes to the statues and memorials.\n\nAnti-Confederate sentiment intensified after nine black churchgoers were killed on June 17, 2015, at a church in Charleston, S.C., in a racially motivated massacre.\n\nThe killer, Dylann Roof, was seen on one website holding a gun in one hand and a Confederate flag in the other. The tragedy mobilized once-hesitant Southern cities to get rid of polarizing Civil War statuary.\n\nThe debate intensified after violent, deadly protests in Charlottesville, which began with a protest of authorities’ decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a public park.\n\nThe debate is playing out across the American south, including in Georgia, a state that has a bas-relief image of Confederate luminaries carved into the side of a mountain.\n\nThe Peach State, and Spencer, have been at the center of other controversial debates.\n\nAs The Post’s Lindsey Bever reported, Spencer was the author of an ultimately unsuccessful bill that would have prevented Muslim women from wearing religious garb in public places in Georgia.\n\nGOP Jason Spencer warned colleague Jones talk of ditching Confederate statues could cause Democrat to ‘go missing’ https://t.co/1Jn6umItwD. pic.twitter.com/sTjFrYCpzV — bmaggiemay (@bmaggiemay) August 30, 2017\n\nEdward Ahmed Mitchell, executive director for CAIR-Georgia, told Bever his group “suspects motivated by a desire to discriminate against Georgia Muslims,” and added that the bill was “a bad solution to a nonexistent problem.”\n\nCiting the reaction to the legislation, Spencer ultimately decided to withdraw the bill, saying it “would withstand legal scrutiny, but not political scrutiny.”\n\nNine months later, Spencer was again being scrutinized for words that offended minorities.\n\nJones said her former colleague called her to let her know he wasn’t making a personal threat against her, but he stopped short of apologizing.\n\nJones said she’s disappointed he didn’t renounce his comments. She worries they encouraged racial violence, instead of promoting a rational, civil debate about where Confederate memorials fit in 21st century America.\n\n“I think his comfort with the fact that people in the south of Georgia would believe the right action still does make me uncomfortable,” she said. “Who would want to murder someone over some statues?”\n\nRead more:\n\nFla. mayoral candidate had a message for activists who want reparations: ‘Go back to Africa’\n\n‘Go back to Africa’?

"Manchester bombing: Police find 'significant' car\nStory highlights 22 people were killed in what police say was a suicide bombing\n\nAn evacuation is being carried out near the vehicle\n\nLondon (CNN) Police in Britain say they have found a car they believe to be 'significant' to their investigation into Manchester bomber Salman Abedi.\n\nGreater Manchester police said Friday that a white Nissan Micra found in the city points to Abedi's whereabouts between May 18 and 22, in the lead-up to the suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert, which left 22 people dead, as well as Abedi himself.\n\n'This is potentially a significant development in the investigation,' Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson said in a statement.\n\nOfficers are currently at the location and are assessing the car as an evacuation is carried out, the police statement said. There is a 100-meter cordon in place as a precaution, and police asked people to avoid the area.\n\n'We are very interested in anything people can tell us about the movements of this car, and who was in it, over the past months.

"What does US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital mean?\nDonald Trump’s abandonment of decades of US policy has set him at odds with the rest of the world and could have far-reaching consequences\n\nIn a move condemned by most of the world, Donald Trump has announced the US will recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. What does his move mean for the key players?\n\n\n\nThe peace process\n\nThis has been in effect at death’s door since the former secretary of state John Kerry’s peace mission ended in failure in 2014. But the international community – apart from the US – is united in saying recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is disastrous for any hopes of reviving meaningful talks. The status of Jerusalem is one of the pivotal issues that diplomats and peacemakers have said must be agreed between the two parties in negotiations.\n\n\n\nDefiant Trump confirms US will recognise Jerusalem as capital of Israel Read more\n\nThe Palestinians\n\nThey will see Trump’s announcement as the end of their hopes and demands for East Jerusalem as a capital of a future independent Palestinian state. Although few Palestinians want a return to violence, many will feel that diplomatic efforts have got them no closer to a state of their own and will see little alternative to direct action.\n\n\n\nTrump opens dangerous fracture line in deeply divided Jerusalem Read more\n\nThe state of Israel\n\nThe Israeli government will be thrilled. Ever since it captured (and later annexed) East Jerusalem in the 1967 six-day war, Israel has claimed the city as its “eternal and undivided” capital, and has longed for international recognition. Trump’s decision will reinforce the view of many Israeli politicians that there is little to be gained by negotiating with the Palestinians. Some 200,000 Israelis living in settlements in occupied East Jerusalem, illegal under international law, will also celebrate.\n\n\n\nThe region\n\nTrump’s move will further destabilise an already volatile region. The powerful Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the US was “plunging the region and the world into a fire with no end in sight”. Turkey hinted it might cut diplomatic ties with Israel if the plan goes ahead. Saudi Arabia – an important ally of the US in the region – believe the move damages Riyadh’s continuing efforts to rekindle a peace deal. The Arab countries that border Israel – Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria – have all condemned the move.\n\n\n\nEurope\n\nMost western European countries will be deeply alarmed by US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But a key question is whether the EU will take action, such as robustly enforcing bans on imports from West Bank settlements and refusing to deal with Israeli businesses operating in occupied territory, setting itself on a clearly differentiated course from that of the US.\n\n\n\nChristians in the Holy Land\n\nPatriarch Theophilos III, the Greek Orthodox patriarchate, widely seen as the most senior Christian figure in Jerusalem, and a dozen other church leaders in the Holy Land sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday warning of “irreparable harm”. His move “will yield increased hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division”, they said. Church leaders will be anxious to protect Christian sites.\n\n\n\nThe city itself\n\nIn 2015, Palestinians made up 37% of the city’s population of about 850,000. Many live in overcrowded homes and neighbourhoods, unable to get permits to build or extend buildings. Three-quarters live below the poverty line and 25% live in neighbourhoods cut off from the rest of the city by the separation barrier. It is hard to see how Trump’s move will improve conditions for them. Nir Barkat, the city’s mayor, said on Wednesday: “Here in Jerusalem and Israel we applaud the president,” and if people became violent, “they will pay a heavy price”.\n\n","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/us-recognition-of-jerusalem-as-israel-capital-what-it-means","1512536400.0"
"Bernie and Jane Sanders, under FBI investigation for bank fraud, hire lawyers\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys amid an FBI investigation into a loan Jane Sanders obtained to expand Burlington College while she was its president, CBS News confirms.\n\nPolitico Magazine first reported the Sanders had hired lawyers to defend them in the probe. Sanders' top adviser Jeff Weaver told CBS News the couple has sought legal protection over federal agents' allegations from a January 2016 complaint accusing then-President of Burlington College, Ms. Sanders, of distorting donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from People's United Bank to purchase 33 acres of land for the institution.\n\nAccording to Politico, prosecutors might also be looking into allegations that Sen. Sanders' office inappropriately urged the bank to approve the loan.\n\nBurlington attorney and Sanders supporter Rich Cassidy has reportedly been hired to represent Sen. Sanders. And high-profile Washington defense attorney Larry Robbins, who counseled I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, is protecting Jane Sanders.\n\nMs. Sanders' push for the liberal arts college's costly land acquisition was cited in a press release by the college when it shut down in 2016.\n\nBrady Toensing of Burlington, the man responsible for the claims filed to the U.S. attorney for Vermont, was a chairman for the Trump campaign in his state.\n\n'I filed a request for an investigation in January 2016 and an investigation appears to have been started right away,' he said in an email to CBS News. 'It was started under President Obama, his Attorney General, and his U.S. Attorney, all of whom are Democrats.'\n\n'My only hope is for a fair, impartial, and thorough investigation,' Toensing added.\n\nWeaver told CBS News that Toensing's claim that Sen. Sanders used his influence to lobby for the loan is a 'political charge' that is 'baseless' and 'false.'\n\nAnd as for the claim that Ms. Sanders manipulated the loan application, Weaver said, 'The loan was approved by the financial board at the college.'\n\nSen. Sanders, formerly mayor of Burlington, Vermont's largest city, regards the claims as a political game levied against him after his run for president in the 2016 primary election, a platform which has transformed the small-state senator into an influential voice in American liberal politics.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-and-jane-sanders-under-fbi-investigation-for-bank-fraud-hire-lawyers/","None"
"U.K. Officials Said Material on Tower Was Banned. It Wasn’t.\nLONDON — In the aftermath of Britain’s deadliest fire in decades, two senior officials sought to deflect blame from the government over the weekend by arguing that the type of building material believed to have spread flames rapidly up the 24-story Grenfell Tower had been banned under national fire safety regulations.\n\nBut experts on British fire safety rules say that the material, used as exterior cladding, in fact complied with regulations. Other countries, including the United States, have placed stricter restrictions on how such materials can be used, but Britain had not yet done so, they said.\n\nThe question of whether the cladding complied with national regulations — and whether those regulations were too lax — is a central part of the investigation into the horrific blaze last week. It will help determine how much blame falls on the government, and how much is assigned to the tower’s owners or builders.\n\nThe toll rose on Monday to 79 confirmed or presumed dead and was expected to climb further, making the fire the country’s deadliest in decades, perhaps since the early 20th century. It broke out at the West London tower early on Wednesday, lasted six hours and incinerated the building. Hundreds were left homeless. The government has announced a formal public inquiry, and a criminal investigation has been opened.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/world/europe/uk-grenfell-tower-london-fire.html","1497844800.0"
"U.S. to Move Carrier Strike Group Closer to Korean Peninsula\nWithin hours of the U.S. announcement, North Korea vowed to boost its defenses. A foreign ministry official told the country's state-run news agency that recent U.S. airstrikes on Syria proved that it needed to protect itself against Washington.\n\n'The recent U.S. military attack on Syria is an action of warning,' the report said, according to the Associated Press. 'We will bolster up in every way our capability for self-defense to cope with the U.S. evermore reckless moves for a war and defend ourselves with our own force.'\n\nDave Benham, a spokesman for U.S. Pacific Command, earlier said moving the carrier strike group was a 'prudent measure to maintain readiness and presence in the Western Pacific.'\n\n'The number one threat in the region continues to be North Korea, due to its reckless, irresponsible, and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability,' Benham said.\n\nRelated: Trump's Options for North Korea Include Placing Nukes in South Korea\n\nSome U.S. allies in the region welcomed Washington's moves.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praised the 'strong commitment' of President Donald Trump to global and allied security after his second call with Trump in four days, Reuters reported.\n\nThe two leaders agreed to remain in close contact along with South Korea on the North and to closely watch China's response to Pyongyang's missile and nuclear development, Abe told reporters at his official residence.\n\nThe U.S. move comes after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced a change in approach to curb North Korea's ambitions for its weapons programs.\n\nIn South Korea last month, Tillerson said 'the policy of strategic patience has ended.' He said military option is on the table if the North Korea elevates the threat of its weapons program.\n\nA U.S. Navy F18 fighter jet lands on the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson following a patrol off the disputed South China Sea.

It deployed around 7,500 sailors when it left port in San Diego on Jan. 5.

"Tower of Human Skulls in Mexico Casts New Light on Aztec Sacrifices\nBreaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nMEXICO CITY — A tower of human skulls unearthed beneath the heart of Mexico City has raised new questions about the culture of sacrifice in the Aztec Empire after crania of women and children surfaced among the hundreds embedded in the forbidding structure.\n\nArchaeologists have found more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments in the cylindrical edifice near the site of the Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City.\n\nLorena Vazquez, an archaeologist from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), works on June 30, 2017 at a site where more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments were found in the cylindrical edifice near Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City, Mexico. Henry Romero / Reuters\n\nThe tower is believed to form part of the Huey Tzompantli, a massive array of skulls that struck fear into the Spanish conquistadores when they captured the city under Hernan Cortes, and mentioned the structure in contemporary accounts.\n\nHistorians relate how the severed heads of captured warriors adorned tzompantli, or skull racks, found in a number of Mesoamerican cultures before the Spanish conquest.\n\nSkulls are seen on June 30, 2017 at a site where more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments were found in the cylindrical edifice near Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City, Mexico. Henry Romero / Reuters\n\nBut the archaeological dig in the bowels of old Mexico City that began in 2015 suggests that picture was not complete.\n\n'We were expecting just men, obviously young men, as warriors would be, and the thing about the women and children is that you'd think they wouldn't be going to war,' said Rodrigo Bolanos, a biological anthropologist investigating the find.\n\n'Something is happening that we have no record of, and this is really new, a first in the Huey Tzompantli,' he added.\n\nRelated: Aztec Ball Court Discovered by Archaeologists in Mexico City\n\nRaul Barrera, one of the archaeologists working at the site alongside the huge Metropolitan Cathedral built over the Templo Mayor, said the skulls would have been set in the tower after they had stood on public display on the tzompantli.\n\nRoughly six meters in diameter, the tower stood on the corner of the chapel of Huitzilopochtli, Aztec god of the sun, war and human sacrifice. Its base has yet to be unearthed.\n\nBiological anthropologists from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) examine on June 30, 2017, skulls discovered at a site where more than 650 skulls caked in lime and thousands of fragments were found in the cylindrical edifice near Templo Mayor, one of the main temples in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, which later became Mexico City, Mexico. Henry Romero / Reuters\n\nThere was no doubt that the tower was one of the skull edifices mentioned by Andres de Tapia, a Spanish soldier who accompanied Cortes in the 1521 conquest of Mexico, Barrera said.\n\nIn his account of the campaign, de Tapia said he counted tens of thousands of skulls at what became known as the Huey Tzompantli. Barrera said 676 skulls had so far been found, and that the number would rise as excavations went on.\n\nThe Aztecs and other Mesoamerican peoples performed ritualistic human sacrifices as offerings to the sun.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/tower-human-skulls-mexico-casts-new-light-aztec-sacrifices-n779106","None"
"Some U.S. diplomats in Cuba diagnosed with serious health conditions, medical records show\nAccording to medical records reviewed exclusively by CBS News, a U.S. doctor who evaluated American and Canadian diplomats working in Havana diagnosed them with conditions as serious as mild traumatic brain injury, and with likely damage to the central nervous system.\n\nThe diplomats complained about symptoms ranging from hearing loss and nausea to headaches and balance disorders after the State Department said 'incidents' began affecting them beginning in late 2016. A source familiar with these incidents says officials are investigating whether the diplomats were targets of a type of sonic attack directed at their homes, which were provided by the Cuban government. The source says reports of more attacks affecting U.S. embassy workers on the island continue.\n\nThe doctor, one of several who reviewed their cases, included a warning in the medical records about the health risks of future exposures. The diplomats underwent comprehensive audiological evaluations and a battery of other tests.\n\nIn a statement received by CBS News from the University of Miami Health System, they confirmed its physicians were 'consulted' by State on its diplomats in Cuba.\n\n'Like any top-notch academic medical center in the nation, the University of Miami is often consulted regarding complex health care issues or emerging diseases. In the case of U.S. diplomats, our physicians were consulted by the State Department,' read the statement from the university.\n\n'The expertise of our physicians and researchers across a variety of fields naturally positions us to assist in these matters, and we consider it our obligation and responsibility to share that knowledge as needed. Regardless of the circumstances of providing medical care, maintaining patient privacy stands as a top priority for the University.'\n\nAn American doctor also visited Havana in the spring to assess U.S. embassy workers, according to the source.\n\nA number of diplomats have cut short their assignments in Cuba because of the attacks.\n\nThe source says American diplomats have also been subjected other types of harassment including vehicle vandalization, constant surveillance, and home break-ins.\n\nAlthough the State Department says it hasn't identified a definitive source of the attacks, it has reminded Cuban authorities of their international obligations to protect diplomats. The U.S. also expelled two Cuban embassy officials in Washington May 23.\n\n'We hold the Cuban authorities responsible for finding out who is carrying out these health attacks on not just our diplomats but, as you've seen now, there are other cases with other diplomats involved,' Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters earlier this month.\n\nCuba has denied any involvement in the attacks.\n\n'We remain in regular contact with the Cuban government to emphasize that we take these incidents very seriously and to resolve this matter in a satisfactory manner,' a State Department spokesperson for Western Hemisphere Affairs tells CBS News.\n\nBut as the U.S. pledges publicly to hold Cuba accountable for the protection of its diplomats, there are signs the U.S. may be privately moving forward with plans to make it easier for Americans to visit and do business with the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control removed hundreds of internet domain names primarily focused on travel to Cuba from its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list. The people, groups and entities on this list are restricted from doing business in the U.S.\n\n'While there may be a legal basis for the removal of the domain names from the SDN/BP list, to remove so many at one moment has optical significance,' says John Kavulich, president of the New York-based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. It 'is demonstrative of the distance between political rhetoric and practical implementation of policy.'\n\nBut a Treasury Department official explained to CBS News that OFAC's removal of the domain names may be misconstrued as more significant than it actually is. A single company was delisted Tuesday, and that company had 60 websites with 'countless domain names,' the official said. Delisting that one company meant including all of the websites and domains associated with the company.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/some-u-s-diplomats-in-cuba-diagnosed-with-serious-health-conditions-medical-records-show/","None"
"The governor who's castigating the president on climate change\nOur country is divided between red states and blue states, a division that has intensified since the election of President Donald Trump. And some of the blue states are intensifying their resistance to the president. Most prominently, California, the country's bluest and most populous state, led by Governor Jerry Brown. Brown has been governor of California twice -- the first time, 40 years ago. He criticizes the president on taxes. California is suing the Trump administration over health care, immigration, and air quality, but nothing raises more righteous passion in Jerry Brown than the issue of climate change. He castigates the president for denying the science and aggravating a problem Governor Brown says is causing California to burn.\n\nThis is the most destructive fire season on record in California. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency this past week as raging wildfires, whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds and fueled by bone-dry brush, laid waste to tens-of-thousands of acres in Southern California. The smoke plume that shrouded the Los Angeles area could be seen from space. The fires that ravaged California's famed wine country in October were the deadliest the state has ever seen. Whole neighborhoods were incinerated. Dozens of people were killed.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: The fire season used to be a few months in the summer, now it's almost year-long. These fires are unprecedented. We've never seen anything like it. Scientists are telling us, 'This is the kind of stuff that's gonna happen.' And we gotta deal with it.\n\nIt's going to happen, he says, based on science that predicts extreme swings in weather patterns. This year, Southern California experienced record heat in October and November, creating the perfect conditions for this.\n\n'I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed.'\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Nature is not a political game. Nature is the ground on which we stand, it's the air which we breathe. The truth of the case is that there's too much carbon being emitted, that heat-trapping gases are building up, the planet is warming and all hell is breaking loose.\n\nBill Whitaker: President Trump has famously called climate change -- a hoax. When he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord he said this wasn't a good deal for the United States.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: That's a preposterous idea not even a shred of truth in that statement. So I'd say to Mr. Trump, take a deeper look now is not the time to undo what every country in the world is committed to.\n\nBill Whitaker: Are you fearful?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Oh yeah, you should, anyone who isn't is not looking at the facts. I don't think President Trump has a fear of the Lord, the fear of the wrath of God, which leads one to more humility. And this is such a reckless disregard for the truth and for the existential consequences that can be unleashed.\n\nIf he sounds like a Jesuit seminarian, it's because he was one, years ago. Now, he's a climate missionary, traveling the world, preaching the gospel of renewable energy -- at the Vatican; in China, where President Xi Jinping discussed collaborating with California on cutting greenhouse gases. Brown went to the global climate summit in Bonn, Germany last month. He and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg led a delegation of mayors and legislators representing 40% of the U.S. economy. While the official U.S. delegation, sent by the White House, showed up to promote coal; Brown went to tell the world President Trump doesn't speak for all Americans.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: California is not waiting for Trump. We're not waiting for all the deniers.\n\nHe's already weaning California off fossil fuels. To give us a glimpse of the future, Brown took us to a 62-acre solar farm near Sacramento on the site of a decommissioned nuclear power plant.\n\nCBS News\n\nBill Whitaker: You wanna have 50% of California's electricity generated by renewable sources by--\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: By 2030.\n\nBill Whitaker: --2030. And you--\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: And I think--\n\nBill Whitaker: --think you're gonna beat that?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Yes, no question about it.\n\nWith the federal government standing down on climate action, California is blazing its own trail.\n\nBill Whitaker: What can you, the governor of one state in the United States, do to fill in the void?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: As governor of California we have a cap and trade system which is a very efficient way to reducing greenhouse gases. We have zero-emission vehicle mandate. We have efficiency standards for our buildings, for our appliances. So California is showing that dealing with climate is good for the economy, not bad.\n\n'The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous.'\n\nCalifornia is booming. Under Brown, it has grown from the 9th largest economy in the world to the 6th. It's now bigger than France with a budget surplus of more than $7 billion.\n\nBill Whitaker: When you first came into office this time. California faced more than $50 billion in debt and deficits. There were headlines that California was going to be the first 'failed state.'\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: The fact is we cut the budget, we raised taxes and the economy roared back.\n\nBill Whitaker: You cut the budget. You raised taxes. These days that sounds like a prescription for political suicide?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: You gotta pay some taxes. You have to invest. We need to invest in the technology of tomorrow or somebody else will. And that somebody is China, India and other countries. You're not gonna poor mouth yourself to the future and roads cost money, that's called taxes. R&D cost money, colleges cost money -- schools, childcare, all of that. We're a rich country and we can handle it.\n\nBut California's economic success has come at a cost. Housing prices are through the roof. So are the ranks of the homeless. A quarter of the country's homeless live in California.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: This is not paradise. We have a lot of problems. But California is the engine of America, and I like to remind my fellow citizens when you kinda look askance at this state, you're looking at one of the, not the only one, but a major contributor to the well-being of the whole country.\n\nCalifornia is vital to the national economy. That's why Brown is so angered by the new tax overhaul legislation being pushed by House and Senate Republicans. They call it a tax cut, but Brown says by eliminating deductions for state and local taxes it would actually increase the tax burden on high tax blue states like California. He and other blue state governors say the bill is retaliation against Trump's opponents. Brown called it evil and divisive.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you think the Republicans are intentionally trying to punish the blue states that didn't vote for President Trump?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: I know this. The Republicans have this cult. Just like they believe there's no climate problem, they believe that cutting corporate taxes without any money to pay for it, they think it's magic, it'll make everything wonderful. Very irresponsible. Very dangerous.\n\nCBS News\n\nBut California Republicans say Brown's tax hikes are irresponsible. In Trump's America, Jerry Brown's California seems far out on the frontier. California doesn't look like the rest of the country: Minorities now are the majority of the population. It doesn't act like the rest of the country: The state voted to legalize recreational marijuana starting in January; will soon offer a third gender choice on drivers' licenses. Hillary Clinton trounced President Trump here by more than 4 million votes.\n\nBill Whitaker: It seems that California is way out of step with the rest of the country.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: I'd say we're more in tune with the future than many parts of the rest of the country.\n\nBill Whitaker: You think the country is going to look more like California in the future?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: I think it will. I was asking myself, 'Why did Democrats in Ohio and Wisconsin and Michigan, Pennsylvania, why'd they vote for Trump?' Not a lot of 'em did, but enough to give him those states' electoral votes.\n\nBill Whitaker: And your answer?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: There's more confidence here; there's less fear. People are looking to the future. They're not scared, they're not going inward, they're not scapegoating, they're not blaming Mexican immigrants. They're not blaming the stranger. Just the opposite. It's is a place that's alive. It's dynamic. It's a culture that's on the move, not pulling up the drawbridge out of fear and and economic insecurity.\n\nJerry Brown is California's 39th and oldest governor. When he first held the office in 1975 he had a full head of hair. His father, Pat Brown had been governor eight years before. When you look at all the staid portraits of his predecessors in the capitol rotunda, it's obvious Jerry Brown is not like the others. Not many politicians spent four years in the seminary as Brown did in the 1950s. Or dated a rock star. He went out with Linda Rondstadt in the 70s.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: I've seen a lotta different things. I've worked with Mother Theresa. I've spent six months doing Zen meditation in Kamakura, Japan and I've run for President three times. I've done very incompatible things.\n\nBill Whitaker: People who like you will say that that's evidence of intellectual flexibility. People who don't like you say that that's evidence of your being flighty.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Well, I'm not gonna -- that's that psycho babble.\n\nWhatever you call it, his far-out politics his first time in office earned him the moniker Governor Moonbeam. We found him to be down to earth. He's California casual at the office. His dog Colusa has the run of the place.\n\nBill Whitaker: Are you better at being governor this time?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Yeah, it's a different experience. 79 is not 36. Different ball game in every way. So I would say I know more, I understand more.\n\nBill Whitaker: What have you learned about yourself in those intervening years?\n\nCBS News\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: There's something you lose with age, your physical prowess -- but mental acuity and -- just life experience is very important. So, I enjoy the job a lot more.\n\nIt's hard to see why. His liberal policies make him a punching bag for conservatives and he's not universally loved by liberals. He's a political maverick. He's rolling back state union pensions. He refuses to curb oil production until there's a viable alternative. A majority of Californians like what he's doing. But he's been doing this for almost 50 years and he says it's time to hang up his political spurs. When he leaves office in January 2019, he swears he's going to leave elective politics behind.\n\nBill Whitaker: I think you're gonna miss this.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: No I won't.\n\nBill Whitaker: You don't think so?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Next year I'll be 80, okay? And what do I want to do with my life? That's my question.\n\nBill Whitaker: What do you want to do?\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Well, I want to spend time with my wife.\n\nA go it alone bachelor nearly all of his adult life, Jerry Brown now has a partner to share his life -- Anne Gust Brown, a former executive at The Gap. They married in 2005. Their plan is to retire to a ranch, in a golden valley north of Sacramento. They're building their dream ranch house - with solar panels, of course. It's off the grid and way off the beaten path.\n\nThe governor and Colusa, showed us around.\n\nBill Whitaker: This is beautiful governor. This is pretty steep.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown: Oh you haven't seen nothing yet.\n\nHe told us he's going out at his peak, stepping away from the fray on land his great-grandfather settled in the 1860s. He said he intends to be a modest rancher.

"Jerusalem: Trump's envoy Haley berates 'outrageous UN hostility'\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption People gathered in the Old City in Jerusalem\n\nThe US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has accused the UN of damaging the prospects for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe organisation 'has outrageously been one of the world's foremost centres of hostility towards Israel', she said.\n\nMrs Haley was addressing an emergency meeting of the Security Council called after President Donald Trump's decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nThe move has been widely condemned and sparked clashes in the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has carried out air strikes against targets in the Gaza Strip, injuring a number of people, after Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israeli territory.\n\nTwo Palestinian men died after Israeli troops fired on crowds in Gaza during clashes earlier on Friday.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US ambassador Nikki Haley calls UN hostile to Israel\n\nTensions remain high across the Middle East after Mr Trump announced the US would recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing decades of US neutrality on the matter.\n\nIsrael has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\n\nMrs Haley said the decision 'recognises the obvious; that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel'.\n\nShe said the US continued to be 'committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement', and accused the UN of bias.\n\n'Israel will never be, and never should be, bullied into an agreement by the United Nations or by any collection of countries that have proven their disregard for Israel's security.'\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC reporters in Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, Afghanistan and Pakistan convey the public mood\n\nThe Palestinian representative, Riyad Mansour, said Mr Trump's move meant the US could no longer be seen as a broker of peace.\n\n'Complicity must be recognised,' he said.\n\nIsrael's representative, Danny Danon, thanked the US for what he called 'a milestone for Israel, for peace, and for the world'.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nChief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians would not talk to the US until Mr Trump reversed his decision\n\nBoth Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the highest Sunni Muslim authority in the world, the imam of al-Azhar mosque in Egypt, said they would not meet US Vice President Mike Pence when he visited the Middle East later this month\n\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it could take two years before the US embassy was relocated from Tel Aviv\n\nThe Israeli army said a rocket had hit the town of Sderot in southern Israel, but did not say whether anyone had been injured\n\nIsraeli aircraft attacked Hamas military facilities in Gaza in retaliation, the Israeli army said, and the area's hospital said 14 people were wounded\n\nWhere has there been violence?\n\nIn the West Bank, Israeli forces clashed with Palestinians in the cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah, Hebron and Nablus, as well as smaller locations.\n\nIsrael had deployed extra battalions to the West Bank in anticipation of violence after Palestinian leaders called for protests after Friday prayers.\n\nAt least 217 Palestinians were wounded in confrontations in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Palestinian medics said.\n\nElsewhere, demonstrations against Mr Trump's announcement have spread.\n\nThousands of pro-Palestinian protesters held noisy demonstrations in Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Tunisia and Iran.\n\nFurther afield, protesters rallied in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indian-administered Kashmir and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country.\n\nWhy does Trump's announcement matter?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why the city of Jerusalem matters\n\nJerusalem is of huge importance to both Israel and the Palestinians. It contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity.\n\nIsrael occupied the eastern sector - previously occupied by Jordan - in 1967, and annexed it in 1980, but the move has never been recognised internationally.\n\nSome 330,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem, along with about 200,000 Israeli Jews in a dozen settlements there. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel does not regard them as settlements but legitimate neighbourhoods.\n\nAccording to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.\n\nThe last round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014 and while the US is formulating fresh proposals, Palestinian officials have said Mr Trump's announcement has disqualified the US from brokering future negotiations.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42287429","None"
"Chinese paper says China should stay neutral if North Korea attacks first\nBEIJING (Reuters) - If North Korea launches an attack that threatens the United States then China should stay neutral, but if the United States attacks first and tries to overthrow North Korea’s government China will stop them, a Chinese state-run newspaper said on Friday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Members of honour guards hold red flags during a welcoming ceremony for Denmark's Queen Margrethe II outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing April 24, 2014.

It has expressed frustration with both Pyongyang’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and with behavior from South Korea and the United States that it sees as escalating tensions.\n\nThe widely read state-run Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, wrote in an editorial that Beijing is not able to persuade either Washington or Pyongyang to back down.\n\n“It needs to make clear its stance to all sides and make them understand that when their actions jeopardize China’s interests, China will respond with a firm hand,” said the paper, which does not represent government policy.\n\n“China should also make clear that if North Korea launches missiles that threaten U.S. soil first and the U.S. retaliates, China will stay neutral,” it added.\n\n“If the U.S. and South Korea carry out strikes and try to overthrow the North Korean regime and change the political pattern of the Korean Peninsula, China will prevent them from doing so.”\n\nChina has long worried that any conflict on the Korean peninsula, or a repeat of the 1950-53 Korean war, could unleash a wave of destabilizing refugees into its northeast, and could end up with a reunified county allied with the United States.\n\nNorth Korea is a useful buffer state for China between it and U.S. forces based in South Korea, and also across the sea in Japan.\n\nThe Global Times said China will “firmly resist any side which wants to change the status quo of the areas where China’s interests are concerned”.\n\n“The Korean Peninsula is where the strategic interests of all sides converge, and no side should try to be the absolute dominator of the region.”\n\n(Story refiles to correct typographical error to “them”, not “then”, paragraph 1.)","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-china-media/chinese-paper-says-china-should-stay-neutral-if-north-korea-attacks-first-idUSKBN1AR005","1502413200.0"
"Amtrak train derailment: At least 3 killed in Washington state crash\nDUPONT, Wash. -- An Amtrak train derailed on an overpass in Washington state Monday morning, with some of the 14 train cars careening onto vehicles on a highway below. The crash left at least three people dead and roughly 100 injured, officials said, and authorities are still combing through the wreckage to find victims.\n\nAuthorities said the derailed train cars struck five motor vehicles and two semi-trucks on the highway. At this time, all southbound lanes of traffic remain closed on Interstate 5.\n\n'Today's tragic incident in Pierce County is a serious and ongoing emergency,' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee wrote in a statement. 'Trudi and I are holding in our hearts everyone on board, and are praying for the many injured. They are our top priority, and I know first responders are doing everything to ensure everyone has the care they need.'\n\nFirst responders are treating the derailment as a mass casualty incident. Authorities have not yet provided details on injuries.\n\n'Emergency crews are on the scene and the Amtrak Management is responding,' an Amtrak spokesperson said in a statement. 'Some injuries are reported. Service between Seattle and Portland is suspended for the time being.'\n\nAmtrak train 501, which departed shortly before 8 a.m. local time from Tacoma, was part of a new high-speed service that launched Monday morning. The train is able to carry up to 250 people, but Amtrak said there were approximately 80 passengers, five Amtrak crew members and one technician from Talgo, the train car manufacturer, on board at the time.\n\nElaine Thompson / AP\n\nThe Cascades service from Seattle to Portland was supposed to be rated for a maximum speed of 79 mph for the section where it derailed in DuPont, according to passenger Chris Karnes. KIRO-TV reports the train was traveling at 81 mph moments before the derailment.\n\nKarnes, who was on board the train when it derailed, said the emergency doors on the train were not functioning correctly after the crash and passengers had to kick out train windows to exit.\n\nCBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave reports the train tracks themselves are not owned by Amtrak; they're maintained by a freight railroad.\n\n'The tracks, known as the Point Defiance Bypass, are owned by Sound Transit,' the Washington State Department of Transportation wrote in a statement Monday. 'The tracks were previously owned by BNSF and were used for occasional freight and military transport.'\n\nMotorist Greg Mukai, who witnessed the derailment from the highway, described the incident as 'really scary stuff.'\n\n'We suddenly had to go from our 60 mph down to zero as fast as possible,' Mukai said. 'We were all avoiding one another to try and avoid a collision there. We saw smoke and the passenger train hanging from the overpass and on the freeway.'\n\nThe cause of the derailment remains under investigation. An NTSB team is being sent from Washington, D.C., to investigate the incident.\n\nFollow along with live updates below. All times are Eastern unless otherwise noted.\n\n7:40 p.m.: About 100 injured in crash\n\nAround 100 people were transported to local hospitals after the incident, Washington State Patrol spokesperson Brooke Bova said Monday evening.

'On behalf of everyone at Amtrak, I want to express that we are deeply saddened by all that has happened today. Our very first concern is taking care of everyone on board. We will fully and completely and openly cooperate with the NTSB.'\n\nAsked if positive train control (PTC), a system designed to prevent train collisions, was activated at the time of the derailment, Anderson responded, 'No.'\n\nAnderson said he was unable to provide an update on the number or nature of injuries sustained in the crash. Anyone seeking information related to the train derailment should call Amtrak at (800) 523-9101.\n\n2:43 p.m.: NTSB provides updates on derailment\n\n\n\nNTSB board member Bella Dinh-Zarr held a news conference in Washington, D.C. to provide updates about the ongoing investigation.\n\nAsked about the death toll, she responded: 'We leave that to the local authorities to report.'\n\n'We are aware of the fact this was called an inaugural run of this service, but we want to check and make sure what that exactly means and find out more information about that specifically,' she told reporters.\n\n'It's a little bit too early to know right now' whether the crash was speed-related, Dinh-Zarr said.\n\nTwenty NTSB investigators are headed to the scene.\n\n2:06 p.m.: Trump addresses derailment in speech\n\n\n\nDuring his speech unveiling his administration's national security strategy, Mr. Trump commented on the Amtrak derailment.\n\n'Let me begin by expressing our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers for the victims of the train derailment in Washington state,' Mr. Trump said from the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C.

"'Great American Eclipse': Excitement builds for total solar eclipse Aug. 21\nOn Aug. 21, the moon will slip between Earth and sun, casting a roughly 70-mile-wide shadow that will race across the United States from Oregon to South Carolina, giving tens of millions of Americans a chance to enjoy -- and study -- a fleeting but sublime spectacle, the first coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in 99 years.\n\nIt has been dubbed, appropriately enough, the 'Great American Eclipse.'\n\n'It really is fortunate,' said Matthew Penn, an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy Observatory who is leading a nationwide effort to photograph the eclipse from 68 sites along the path of totality.\n\nNASA\n\n'The U.S. only covers 2 percent of the globe, so we get very few eclipses,' he said. 'And to have one travel across the entire country is an unprecedented sort of opportunity. It'll be a heck of day. The best thing is, it can't be cloudy everywhere!'\n\nThe first inklings of what's to come will be visible from the Oregon coast, weather permitting, around 9:05 a.m. local time (12:05 p.m. EDT) when viewers with safety filters, from inexpensive cardboard 'solar glasses' to more sophisticated aids, will see the moon begin to take a bite out of the sun, the start of a partial solar eclipse.\n\nA partial eclipse will be visible across the entire United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, Canada, Central America and northern South America, with more than half of the sun obscured for residents across the lower 48 states.\n\nBut for millions of viewers who make their way into the narrow path of totality, a partial eclipse, a thrilling sight in its own right, will serve as an appetizer for the main course, the all-too-fleeting moments when the moon completely blocks out the sun.\n\nMichael Zeiler, www.GreatAmericanEclipse.com\n\nMoving across the Pacific Ocean at more than 2,400 mph, the dark inner heart of the moon's shadow -- the umbra -- will move ashore near Lincoln Beach, Ore., at 10:16 a.m. local time (1:16 p.m. EDT), and then sweep across 14 states and 20 national parks over the next hour and a half.\n\nMore than 200 million people live within a day's drive of the path of totality, potentially turning the Great American Eclipse into one of the most heavily viewed and shared events in recent memory.\n\n'The Great American Eclipse on Aug. 21 is such an exciting event, it is a really singular and unique event in human history, really, where in the 21st century we have this amazing technology with social media,' said Carrie Black, associate program director of the National Science Foundation's Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.\n\n'And it's happening across the United States, so the entire country can participate,' she said. 'There's never been an event like this in human history where so many people could participate and with such unique technology.'\n\nAmerican Astronomical Society/Dennis di Cicco/Sky & Telescope\n\nWhen the eclipse arrives\n\nTwo minutes and 145 miles after the leading edge of the moon's shadow crosses the coast of Oregon, a partial eclipse will begin in the small town of Madras at 9:07 a.m. local time (12:07 p.m. EDT). With clear skies the rule this time of year, thousands of tourists and astronomers, both amateur and professional, are expected to join 6,400 area residents to take in the show.\n\nOne hour and 12 minutes after the start of the partial eclipse, at 10:19 a.m., the moon will completely block out the sun above Madras, turning a bright morning into deep twilight for the next two minutes and two seconds.\n\nXavier M. Jubier\n\nThe temperature will drop, bright stars like Regulus will appear and the sun's super-heated corona will shimmer into view like a halo around the unseen moon. The light coming in from around the horizon, from beyond the edge of the moon's shadow, will appear in pinkish-orange hues like a 360-degree sunset.\n\n'It's not as dark as night, for the most part,' said Rick Fienberg a spokesman for the American Astronomical Society who holds a doctorate in astronomy. 'This one, the shadow's only about 70 miles wide. So 35 miles away from you, in every direction, it's light. The sky during a total solar eclipse is not black, it's blue.'\n\nBut the star of the show, so to speak, is the sun's corona, a magnetically energized region above the sun's visible surface -- the photosphere -- where the temperature suddenly -- and inexplicably -- climbs from about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit to nearly 4 million degrees.\n\nRick Fienberg / TravelQuest International / Wilderness Travel\n\nThe solar wind, a torrent of electrically charged particles, is accelerated to enormous velocities in the corona, spewing into space in all directions and reaching the farthest corners of the solar system. What drives the corona's extreme temperatures and accelerates the solar wind is a mystery, in part because the region is so difficult to study.\n\nThe inner regions of the corona can only be studied during a total solar eclipse when the moon completely blocks the sun's glare. Satellite instruments and ground-based telescopes create their own artificial eclipses, inserting a circular sun shade into a camera's light path that acts like a miniature moon.\n\nBut to keep from blinding sensitive detectors, such coronagraphs must block the sun's light out to more than a solar diameter. During a total solar eclipse, the actual moon does a much better job, revealing the corona's mysterious innermost regions.\n\n'What's particularly special about a natural eclipse is that the moon is a perfect occulter, it blocks the surface of the sun just perfectly so you can see very low into the solar atmosphere,' Black said. 'Scientists are particularly interested in the low corona, because that's where lots of activity is, that's where the origins of space weather are.'\n\nWith the Aug. 21 eclipse's coast-to-coast track across America, astronomers and citizen scientists will have a golden opportunity to learn more about the processes at work in the corona as millions along the path of totality get a chance to witness the sun's fiery halo.\n\nNASA\n\n'What you see is the jet black silhouette of the moon framed by the beautiful white of the corona, streaming out in all directions, usually several diameters of the sun away,' Fienberg said. 'What makes it especially wonderful is the quality of the light, and the fact that the corona behaves like iron filings around a bar magnet, it traces the sun's magnetic field. So you see loops and streamers ... and it's just spectacular.\n\n'And the light, the quality of the light is very unusual, too,' he added. 'You're looking at glowing ionized gas, which is like what's in a fluorescent bulb or something, it's a mix of that and a mix of sunlight reflected off electrons and sunlight reflected off dust in the solar system, so it's a very different kind of light than ordinary daylight.'\n\nUnlike the partial phases of a solar eclipse, when even a sliver of sunlight can cause eye damage if viewed for extended periods or any sort of optical aid, the fully eclipsed sun is safe to look at during the few minutes the moon completely covers the sun's disk.\n\nJay M. Pasachoff\n\n'The total amount of light coming from the eclipsed sun, that's about as much light as comes from a full moon,' Fienberg said. 'That's why we keep telling people, it's perfectly safe to look at the totally eclipsed sun. Once every last part of the sun's bright everyday face is covered, what's left, the corona, is about as bright as the full moon. So it's no more dangerous to look at.'\n\nFienberg will be in Madras with a tour group, his 13th trip to witness a total solar eclipse. His advice to first-time eclipse watchers: don't worry about telescopes or sophisticated optics. Just take in one of nature's grandest shows with the unaided eye.\n\n'If you just look at it with a telescope, you're going to see the solar corona and you're going to see all kinds of interesting loops and streamers and things, but you're going to miss the broader effect. You might not see the sunset colors around the horizon, you might not realize how blue the sky is because in the telescope it'll just look black,' he said.\n\n'You won't see bright stars and planets that come out around the sun because they're going to be outside the field of view of the telescope. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to alternate between using low-power binoculars and my naked eye.'\n\nThe view in binoculars is 'really breathtaking,' he said, 'because you see a lot more detail in the corona, but you also see it in context, you see the whole sun and the whole corona and you get the bluish sky in the background.'\n\nWhile it might seem contrary to countless warnings, using binoculars during totality, when the sun's light is completely blocked, is not dangerous in and of itself. And the observer will see clear signs totality is ending in plenty of time to look away and switch back to a filtered view.\n\nBut aside from the few minutes of totality, one should never look at the sun directly, experts warn, with or without optical aid, even during a nearly full partial eclipse, without using an internationally certified filter designed to reduce the sun's glare to a safe level.\n\n'There's probably going to be an uptick in eye injuries no matter how much you tell people and how easy it is to get your hands on solar filters,' Fienberg said. 'There are always people who will either ignore the messaging or just take unnecessary risks. But ... it's really hard to hurt yourself by looking at the sun too long. It's very uncomfortable.'\n\nCross-country path of eclipse\n\nFrom Madras, the moon's shadow will race across Oregon and into Idaho, passing just north of Boise before moving on across Idaho Falls at 11:33 a.m. local time (1:33 p.m. EDT), Casper, Wyoming, at 11:42 a.m. (1:42 p.m. EDT), Grand Island, Nebraska, at 12:58 p.m. (1:58 p.m. EDT), St. Joseph, Missouri, at 1:06 p.m. (2:06 p.m. EDT) and nearby Columbia six minutes later. By this point, the shadow will have slowed to about 1,500 mph.\n\nResidents of the northeast corner of Kansas City, just inside the path of totality, will enjoy about a minute of darkness around 1:08 p.m. (2:08 p.m. EDT) as will residents in southwestern St. Louis a few minutes after that.\n\nCrossing the Mississippi River, the center of the moon's shadow will pass just south of Carbondale, Illinois, at 1:20 p.m. (2:20 p.m. EDT) before moving over Paducah and Hopkinsville, Kentucky, at 1:24 p.m. (2:24 p.m. EDT).\n\nAlong this stretch, eclipse watchers will enjoy the maximum duration of the eclipse, about two minutes and 40 seconds of totality.\n\nFrom Kentucky, the shadow will move across Clarksville and then Nashville, Tennessee, the largest city in the path of totality, at 1:27 p.m. (2:27 p.m. EDT) crossing over the Smokey Mountains, the southwest corner of North Carolina and then racing over the heart of South Carolina where viewers in Greenville, Columbia, Charleston will enjoy totality between 2:38 p.m. and 2:47 p.m. EDT\n\nThe moon's shadow then will move off shore and out over the Atlantic Ocean, one hour and 33 minutes after the umbra crossed the coast of Oregon some 2,500 miles away.\n\nGiven its coast-to-coast track through the heartland of the United States, many observers believe the 2017 eclipse will be one of the most viewed in history and certainly the most scientifically studied.\n\n'The other reason this is going to be so well observed is because we now live in a social media era,' Fienberg said. 'Before, there were no smartphones, there was no Facebook, there was no Twitter. You have to literally be locked in an underground bunker to not be able to find out what's going on outside.\n\n'So, everybody's going to hear about this, one way or another, and with any luck, they're going to get excited. ... Even if they don't make it into the path of totality, a deep partial eclipse, observed safely, can be fun.'\n\nWilliams College astronomer Jay Pasachoff, author of an article outlining planned eclipse research in the August issue of Scientific American magazine, plans to observe his 66th solar eclipse from the campus of Willamette University in Salem, Ore., along with an international team of researchers and a battery of telescopes, cameras and spectrographs.\n\n'We've done preliminary versions of this before, but things get refined, the theoretical models get refined and the instruments get better,' he said in an interview. 'We only have about two minutes, so you do the measurements you can. Each time we have an eclipse, the loops of gas, the shape of the corona, the magnetic field is different. So you want to take those couple of minutes whenever you can and find out what's going on there.'\n\nPasachoff team is one of scores that will be stationed along -- and above -- the path of totality. At least 11 NASA spacecraft will train their instruments on the sun, more than 50 high-altitude balloons will take photographs and study the effects of the eclipse on Earth's atmosphere, along with aircraft carrying a variety of instruments.\n\nHundreds of ground-based observatories will swing into action with numerous focused teams of researchers spread out along the path of totality. Veteran eclipse astronomer Shadia Habbal of the University of Hawaii will lead five such teams that, like Pasachoff's, will be studying the inner corona.\n\nPenn is leading a team made up of more than 200 volunteers using identical telescopes, cameras and computers at 68 locations along the path of totality.\n\nThe goal of Penn's Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse) project is to assemble a carefully calibrated movie of the eclipse to learn more about how the sun's magnetic field accelerates particles in the corona. Data will be collected using identical telescopes, cameras and computers operated by volunteers, including students and astronomy club members.\n\n'The thing that excites me the most about this eclipse is that millions of people across the country, in the path of totality, can walk out on their porch in their slippers and collect world-class data,' Penn said. 'They won't have to travel to a large telescope on top of a mountain, you can go into your backyard using fairly modest-size instruments and collect really important research data.'\n\nA more public project, the Eclipse Megamovie, is led by Hugh Hudson, a solar physicist at the University of California at Berkeley. His team is soliciting imagery from volunteers 'as an outreach thing,' he said, 'and make a big movie that incorporates all the images.'\n\n'It will be complicated, but in principle you can ... create an actual movie,' he said. 'That's never been done before as far as I can tell, and this is a wonderful opportunity for us.'\n\nIn an interview, Pasachoff advised the public to take in the partial phases of the eclipse with low-cost solar filters. For viewers in the path of totality, 'just keep looking through them and when that presence diminishes and becomes invisible through the glasses you put the glasses down and watch for a couple of minutes.'\n\n'If you want to look up in those two minutes, which is between two minutes on the Oregon coast on the central line and two minutes 40 seconds in Illinois, then you can glance with binoculars for a few seconds to see some of the detail in the corona. But it's also nice to look around the sky and see what stars and planets you can see and look at that sunset effect on the horizon all around you.'\n\nThe shape of the corona changes during the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle as the number of spots wax and wane. The sun currently is moving into the minimum phase of the cycle 'and that means that the corona will be very extended at the sun's equator and it won't hide the plumes of hot gas, the million-degree-gas, that's coming out of the poles,' Pasachoff said.\n\n'So we'll have an opportunity to study this gas at the poles for the first time in about eight or 10 years.'\n\nFor eclipse novices taking in their first total solar eclipse, Pasachoff said astronomers will 'be glad to give you our pictures.'\n\n'Don't cut into your enjoyment by being too busy with your camera, just watch,' he said, echoing Fienberg's advice.\n\nDoes the view ever get old?\n\n'No, it gets better and better,' he said.\n\nWill weather conditions cooperate?\n\nBut all that assumes the weather cooperates. Canadian meteorologist and eclipse enthusiast Jay Anderson has produced a chart based on more than 15 years of data to give a sense of how much cloud cover might be expected in late August along the path of totality.\n\nIn Madras, for example, eclipse chasers can expect average cloud cover between around 15 and 20 percent. Moving east, cloud cover generally increases depending on topography and other factors. In Nashville, up to 70 percent of the afternoon sky can be cloud covered.\n\nBut as Fienberg noted, climate is what one expects, weather is what one actually gets, 'the idea being that you can predict the statistical likelihood of clear skies based on past history, but weather is a very local phenomenon.'\n\nThat said, 'the northwest is going to have a much better chance of clear skies than the southeast.'\n\n'And so, many of the people who are going to be making a sincere effort to see totality are going to be heading to the northwest,' he said. 'Oregon is very popular, Wyoming, Idaho and Nebraska, all through those states the path of totality is predicted to be 80 percent or 70 percent chance of clear skies. The only exception being the Oregon coast itself.'\n\nThe weather might be better in the northwest, but because of the moon's orbital track and changing distance from the Earth, totality will last longer in the southeast.\n\n'Two minutes and 40 seconds in southern Illinois and western Kentucky, whereas it's only going to be a couple of seconds over two minutes in Oregon,' Fienberg said. 'You want to go where the eclipse will be long, so you tend to go to the point where it's maximum and as close to the center of the path as you can. But you also want to go where the weather prospects are good.\n\n'In this case, a lot of people are going to the northwest,' he said. 'Even though the eclipse won't be as long, the chance of clear skies is better.'\n\nAnd if the weather doesn't cooperate, your car breaks down or your flight is canceled before you can reach the path of totality, you'll get a second chance in 2024 due to the nature of the moon's orbit and Earth's path around the sun.\n\nDuring the 2024 eclipse, the moon's shadow will cross the U.S. border in southern Texas and move up into the eastern half of the United States, passing over Dallas-Fort Worth, Cleveland, Ohio, Buffalo, New York, and Montreal.\n\nThe moon will be closer during the 2024 eclipse, its shadow will be wider and totality will last more than four minutes along most of its track across the United States. The paths of the 2017 and 2024 eclipses will cross near Carbondale, Illinois, where residents will witness their second bout of totality in just six and a half years.\n\n'So if you can't get to totality this time, you're going to see all the pictures and movies on the internet, you're going to hear from people who went, you're going to be really motivated for the next one,' Fienberg said. 'And you've got six and a half years to plan for it.'","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/total-solar-eclipse-august-21-2017/","None"

"Hundreds protest in Anaheim after video shows off-duty LAPD officer firing gun during confrontation with teenagers\nAn off-duty Los Angeles police officer on Feb. 21 fired his gun during an altercation with teenagers in Anaheim, Calif., the Anaheim Police Department said. No one was hit by the gunfire, and two teenagers were arrested. (YouTube/Osmin Jimenez)\n\nHundreds of people took to the streets of Anaheim, Calif., for a sprawling protest Wednesday night that was sparked by video footage showing an off-duty Los Angeles police officer firing his gun during a confrontation with teenagers a day earlier.\n\nNo one was hurt during the shooting, but the episode was recorded and widely shared across social media, sparking anger in the area and leading to a standoff on Anaheim’s streets between demonstrators and police. The officer involved was placed on leave, while two teenagers were arrested after the incident.\n\nPolice say they arrested 23 people — 18 adults, five juveniles — Wednesday night during the protests that followed. Authorities said the demonstrations involved between 200 and 300 people, and according to media accounts from the scene, many who gathered were young people who had seen the recording on social media.\n\nAnger spilled over in Anaheim, Calif., on Feb. 22, after footage emerged of an off-duty Los Angeles police officer firing his gun during a confrontation with teenagers a day earlier. Protesters took to the streets around the officer's house, shouting, 'Don't shoot the kid!' (The Washington Post)\n\nThe shooting incident captured on video, which occurred on a residential street in Anaheim at about 2:40 p.m. Tuesday, involved an off-duty officer having “a physical confrontation” that took place “in front of his residence with several juveniles,” police said.\n\n“The confrontation began over ongoing issues with juveniles walking across the officer’s property,” the Anaheim Police Department said in a statement. “During the confrontation, a 13 year old male is alleged to have threatened to shoot the off-duty officer, at which time the officer attempted to detain the male until APD arrived.”\n\nWhat followed was recorded in footage that spread online, showing the officer struggling with one teenager before being knocked over by another young person before he pulled out his gun and fired a single shot.\n\n[The Washington Post’s 2017 database of fatal police shootings]\n\nRaul Quezada, the Anaheim police chief, said Thursday that according to statements gathered from people involved, the officer shot at the ground rather than any person. Quezada said he was disturbed by the incident and that he wished the officer had not confronted the teenagers before on-duty officers arrived.\n\nWhile no one was wounded or killed, the Anaheim episode comes on the heels of a number of protests in recent years across the country railing against how police officers have used force against people, particularly minorities. In many of these incidents, video recordings helped spur the outrage and anger. Anaheim police have said the videos going viral “do not depict the entire event.”\n\nDemonstrators lined the block in Anaheim shouting 'no justice no peace,' as police blocked the intersection pic.twitter.com/INmixM69F6 — Melissa Etehad اتحاد (@melissaetehad) February 23, 2017\n\nThe officer has been placed on administrative leave, according to the Los Angeles Police Department, which said it is also investigating the shooting. That investigation will focus on whether the officer’s “use of deadly force” complied with Los Angeles police procedures, the department said.\n\nAfter the confrontation, two teenagers were arrested, including a 13-year-old was booked in Orange County for criminal threats and battery, police said. The 13-year-old was later released. A 15-year-old was was arrested for assault and battery before being released to his parents.\n\nAnaheim police did not identify the officer or the teenagers. Because the officer fired his gun, the incident is being investigated by Anaheim homicide detectives, and while the officer does not immediately face arrest, police say the investigation will be given to the district attorney’s office for a decision on possible charges.\n\n“As a father and as a police chief, I too am disturbed by what I saw on the videos that were posted on the Internet,” Quezada, the police chief, said at a news briefing Thursday afternoon.\n\nQuezada said that he has also seen body camera footage showing the first contacts with the people involved, “which have raised additional concerns as to what transpired.” He said police hope to give their investigation to the Orange County district attorney to make a decision on charges in two weeks.\n\nA young demonstrator in #Anaheim wraps an American flag around himself as police stand nearby #anaheimprotest pic.twitter.com/X3CBHcl3Ok — Melissa Etehad اتحاد (@melissaetehad) February 23, 2017\n\nAnaheim city officials vowed a thorough investigation into the incident.\n\n“We as a city are left to figure all this out,” Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait said at the briefing Thursday. “Anaheim is committed to a full and impartial investigation.”\n\nTait said he has heard from people wondering why the teenagers were arrested and not not the officer, and continued that he was wondering the same thing. Speaking after Tait, Quezada said that while there was evidence the officer detained the teenager and fired his gun, “there was insufficient evidence at the time to prove the officer’s actions rose to the level of a criminal act.”\n\nHowever, Quezada said that due to the ongoing investigation, authorities released the 13-year-old from juvenile hall. He added that criminal charges could still be brought against “any and all” people involved.\n\nAnger quickly bubbled up in the community. Anaheim police suggested they had received a flood of messages about the shooting, mentioning the ongoing investigation in a posting on Facebook and writing: “Calling and sending emails to APD voicing your displeasure will NOT impact the outcome.” Police later posted another message with a special telephone number for people to comment on the shooting.\n\n[A black police officer complained about racism. He says his department retaliated by firing him.]\n\nThis was followed by the protests that emerged in Anaheim, with demonstrators seen marching near the officer’s home and moving on streets in the area.\n\nPolice said everyone arrested faced charges of misdemeanors, including failing to disperse. After responding to the protests Wednesday night, police declared it an unlawful assembly, warning as the protest grew that “acts of violence and vandalism will not be tolerated.”\n\nRiot cops protecting alleged LAPD officer in #Anaheim pic.twitter.com/XRfESPuwER — Gabriel San Román (@gsanroman2) February 23, 2017\n\nIn a video recording of the confrontation and shooting that prompted the unrest, a crowd of people — many of them apparently teenagers, most of them wearing backpacks — can be seen standing around a residential sidewalk while an older, bald man in sunglasses is seen struggling with one young person.\n\nThe older man can be seen holding onto the younger person, who at one point in the recording says he is 13 and at another point says, “Let me go, for the last time.” As this continued, the gathered young people continued following the two of them across a home’s grassy yard.\n\nAfter the younger boy says that his hand is going to be red, the older man tells him, “A lot of you’s going to be red because you’ve been resisting this whole time.” The younger boy insists he was not and says he “didn’t do anything to hurt you.” The older man can be heard saying the boy threatened to shoot him, which the younger boy in the recording denies.\n\nWhile the gathered crowd continues watching, one other boy can be seen putting down his backpack on the ground and walking over, at which point he seems to try to break the two apart, although this part of the confrontation is obscured when the camera moves.\n\n[Officer was told to ‘tone down your gayness’ if he wanted a promotion, lawsuit claims]\n\nAs the three of them are standing close together, another young boy in the crowd, still wearing his backpack, rushes over and slams his shoulder into the older man, pushing him toward a row of bushes.

"New details emerge about Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock and girlfriend Marilou Danley\nFBI agents spent Wednesday questioning Marilou Danley, the longtime girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman and considered an integral key by authorities trying to understand what drove Stephen Paddock to open fire from his casino hotel room.\n\nPaddock killed at least 58 people and injured more than 500 on the Las Vegas Strip before killing himself. Danley was in the Philippines at the time of the attack and arrived in Los Angeles late Tuesday. She was met by FBI agents at the airport and questioned Wednesday.\n\nAfter being questioned, Danley said in a statement that she had no clue about his plans to carry out the massacre and pledged to cooperate with authorities struggling to determine what sparked the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.\n\n“I knew Stephen Paddock as a kind, caring, quiet man,” said Danley in a statement read by her lawyer Matthew Lombard, a criminal defense attorney. “He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen.”\n\nDanley, 62, said Paddock bought her a ticket about two weeks ago to visit her family in the Philippines and then wired money to purchase a home for Danley and her family.\n\n“I was grateful, but honestly, I was worried, that first, the unexpected trip home, and then the money, was a way of breaking up with me,” she said. “It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.”\n\nAs investigators continue to search for a Paddock’s motive and question Danley, new details have emerged about both.\n\nDanley is from the Philippines, but she lived for many years in Australia, where authorities have confirmed she is a citizen.\n\nDanley has two sisters who live in Australia, according to news outlets there and old Facebook posts by the sisters, which have been deleted in recent days.\n\nAustralian media have identified the sisters as Liza Werner and Amelia Manango. On a Facebook account that has been deleted, Werner is friends with Danley’s ex-husband and others Danley knew. And in a picture posted by Werner, Danley appears with the two women as well as Danley’s daughter. The caption reads, “Sheila and the three sisters.”\n\nThe sisters did not respond to messages or calls.\n\nBut two women identified as her sisters told an Australian television network Wednesday that they believe Paddock arranged Danley’s trip to the Philippines so that she wouldn’t interfere with his plans.\n\nShe was shocked to know she was leaving, the women told Seven Network Australia on camera with their faces blurred.\n\n“He sent her away so that he can plan what he is planning without interruptions,” one of the women said. “In that sense I thank him for sparing my sister’s life. But that won’t compensate the [dead] people’s lives.”\n\nAuthorities say that before the shooting, Paddock transferred a large amount of money to the Philippines — close to $100,000. His brother, Eric Paddock, said he thought the gunman may have been trying to arrange for Danley to be abroad before carrying out the massacre.\n\nDanley is considered a critical witness in trying to decipher Paddock’s motive, according to a person familiar with the probe. While investigators have described Danley as a “person of interest,” they have not suggested that she is considered an accomplice or involved in any way.\n\nFederal agents — who are assisting the Las Vegas police in the investigation — have essentially two critical questions for Danley: Did she have any idea what motivated him, and did she have any knowledge of what was about to take place and not alert authorities?\n\nGiven how little has emerged in Paddock’s past that could foreshadow the attack, the “best lead is through this girlfriend,” said Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.).\n\nThe women identified by Seven Network Australia as her sisters agreed.\n\n“No one can put the puzzles together — no one except Marilou,” one of the women said. “Because Steve is not here to talk anymore. Only Marilou can maybe help.\n\n“She probably was even more shocked than us because she is more closer to him than us. You know, to be able to find out the person you love and live with can do such a thing? And you thought you know the person yourself.”\n\nHow they met\n\nAs early as August 2013, Danley was already living with Paddock, according to public records. She was separated at that point but still married to another man, Geary Danley.\n\nGeary and Marilou Danley were married in Las Vegas in 1990.\n\nIn 2002, Geary and Marilou Danley moved into a home in a brand-new development in Sparks, Nev. Like everyone else on the street, they bought the lot and had a home built on it, said John Heidenreich, her neighbor two doors down. He said the Danleys’ house was the first completed in the 15-home neighborhood. He recalled Danley as a friendly woman who showed up at neighborhood barbecues and other social events on the block.\n\nDanley was working then as a high-limit hostess at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, Nev.\n\n“I guess she just liked that casino lifestyle,” Heidenreich said.\n\n“They seemed like great people,” he said of the couple.\n\nHeidenreich said he was surprised when the couple separated. Danley’s former stepdaughters, who now live in Arkansas, told local TV reporters that they separated in the spring of 2013, at which point Geary moved back to his native Arkansas.\n\n[VIDEO: Marilou Danley’s former stepdaughters speak out]\n\nAccording to court records, the couple filed for divorce on Feb. 25, 2015, and it was finalized the next day. During her divorce, Marilou Danley listed a downtown Reno apartment as her address, which was owned by Paddock.\n\nPaddock met Danley while she was working at the Atlantis Casino, said his brother Eric Paddock.\n\nPaddock was a frequent gambler at the casino where Danley once worked. He was such a regular that his entire family once took over the top floor at the casino’s expense, his brother said.\n\n“They were adorable — big man, tiny woman. He loved her. He doted on her,” Eric said at his home in Florida. The two often gambled side by side, he said.\n\nEmployees at a Starbucks in Mesquite, Nev., however, described the couple’s relationship differently. A supervisor at the coffee shop told the Los Angeles Times that Paddock often berated Danley in public. The Starbucks is the only one in town and is inside the Virgin River Casino.\n\n“It happened a lot,” Esperanza Mendoza, supervisor of the Starbucks, told the Times. He would verbally abuse her when Danley asked to use his casino card to buy food or other things inside the casino, Esperanza said.\n\n“He would glare down at her and say — with a mean attitude — ‘You don’t need my casino card for this. I’m paying for your drink, just like I’m paying for you.’ Then she would softly say, ‘Okay’ and step back behind him. He was so rude to her in front of us.”\n\n[Did Las Vegas gunman follow UT Tower shooter Charles Whitman’s playbook?]\n\nHer family\n\nDanley has a daughter in Los Angeles and a grandchild, according to relatives and public records.\n\nHer daughter, Sheila Darcey Linton, is an artist who lives in Los Angeles and is married to Micah Linton, scion of a wealthy business titan. Her father-in-law, Michael Linton, is the CEO of Promega, a biochemistry company.\n\nThe couple have one child together, according to a 2014 picture posted on Micah Linton’s Facebook account. And they live in an expensive home in Venice with a market value of roughly $2 million.\n\nOn Wednesday, the five-bedroom home had sheets tacked up across the windows, preventing anyone from seeing inside, including TV news vans camped out in front waiting for any sign of Danley or her daughter.\n\nDanley’s daughter describes herself online as an artist and tech worker. In a biography posted on her personal website, she cites her mother’s strong influence on her.\n\nShe said she tried to be a “dutiful Asian daughter to make my mother proud” by pursuing a degree in computer science in college. She later switched her focus to fine arts, she said. “Fortunately, my mother, who was shocked and disappointed, didn’t disown or belittle my decision,” Linton wrote. “Instead, she stood by me and demanded the same excellence in this path as she did in the last. Her love never wavered. It was merely my perspective of her that changed.”\n\nLife with Paddock\n\nAt one point, Danley worked for an airline company, said Elizabeth Tyree, a neighbor in Reno, where Danley and Paddock lived together in a retirement community. Danley later worked for Avon, the cosmetic sales company and tried to sell their products to other residents, Tyree said.\n\nPaddock, 64, bought and sold several properties in recent years as a way of making money, according to relatives and property records. The couple traveled all the time, never staying at any of their homes in Reno and Mesquite, Nev., very long. Neighbors say the couple would disappeared for long stretches — sometimes for months at a time — during Paddock’s gambling trips to casinos.\n\nIn Mesquite, an hour’s drive from Las Vegas, the couple left mixed impressions among residents.\n\nMany recalled seeing Paddock at a bar named Peggy Sue’s and Eureka Casino. They described him as silent, sullen — never talking to anyone.\n\nHe was a regular at the Virgin River, a smaller, dingy casino with card games and machines — from penny slots up to $1 machines.\n\nIn Reno, neighbors also described Paddock as standoffish but recalled Danley as extremely sweet and friendly. Next-door neighbor Tyree said Danley hugged her when she saw her.\n\nThis summer, Tyree saw Danley and Paddock moving a mattress and got a glimpse inside their garage, which was completely empty. Tyree asked Danley whether they were moving, and Danley said they had bought a new house but were not moving out of Reno.\n\nAnother neighbor, Susan Page, who moved next door to the couple this summer, said she had not seen them since August. Paddock had recently bought a new silver minivan, she said, and Danley drove an SUV. On the third week of August, Paddock left the house. Soon after, Page said, Danley packed up her car as well, as if she were moving away.\n\nThe gunman\n\nMore details have also emerged on Paddock, the gunman.\n\nA real estate broker who helped Paddock sell multiple properties in California more than a decade ago said the future gunman expressed dislike for taxes and the government — even selling off a series of buildings in California to move his money to the low-tax havens of Texas and Nevada.\n\nBut the agent, who asked not to be identified discussing Paddock, said Paddock did not appear to be political or ideological. A person familiar with the investigation into the massacre said these anti-government views alone did not explain why Paddock would head to a 32nd floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, break out the windows and open fire into a crowd of unsuspecting citizens.\n\nThe emerging portrait of Paddock suggests a man of considerable means who liked guns, gambling and women, but who so disliked interacting with people that he sought to avoid talking to them.\n\nProperty records show Paddock sold several low-end apartment buildings and commercial buildings in California in the 2000s before purchasing an apartment building in Texas and homes in retirement communities in Florida and Nevada. Between 2003 and 2004, Paddock sold at least three commercial properties in California for a total of more than $5 million.\n\nPaddock would buy apartments, move into them to keep an eye on his investment, but “still would employ other people to talk to the tenants because he didn’t want to talk to the tenants,” the broker said.\n\nThe aversion to human interaction even extended into Paddock’s flying, said the broker, who, like Paddock, enjoyed piloting personal planes.\n\nAt the time of their acquaintance, Paddock had a sleek new aircraft — a Cirrus SR20. On the handful of flights they made together, Paddock would map out his path — steering away from controlled areas — just to avoid having to talk to the air traffic controllers, the broker said.\n\nPaddock’s dislike for human contact, the real estate broker said, was in part why he preferred playing video poker, a type of gambling that does not require interaction with other players.\n\nPaddock’s wardrobe did not bespeak of a man of wealth, said the broker. Paddock often went out unshaven, in sweat pants and flip-flops, even on his thrice-weekly excursions to casinos, where he ate at the buffet.\n\nPaddock stored the Cirrus at a Mesquite Metro Airport hangar between 2007 and 2009, according airport workers. The airport staff had little recollection of him, said Lt. Brian Parrish of the Mesquite Police, “because he paid his bills on time and didn’t cause trouble.”\n\nHis flying hobby appeared to come to an end in 2010. Because of a medical restriction — he needed glasses for near vision — Paddock would have been required to renew a medical certificate to fly. But once his expired in 2010, he never tried to renew it, a Federal Aviation Administration official said.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1985, Paddock worked federal government jobs: as a letter carrier for the Postal Service, an agent for the IRS and an auditor for U.S. government’s Defense Contract Audit Agency, according to the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nNeighbors in several states where he owned homes in retirement communities described him as surly and unfriendly.\n\nHis Father and Brothers\n\nRelatives say the roots of Paddock’s loner lifestyle may have been planted July 28, 1960. On that day, when Paddock was 7, a neighbor from across the street took him swimming. The neighbor at the time told a local newspaper that she knew authorities were coming for his father, a bank robber, and she wanted to spare the boy the trauma of seeing his father hauled away by authorities.\n\n[Las Vegas shooter’s father was a bank robber — and on the FBI’s Most Wanted list]\n\nFrom that point on, Paddock’s family was never the same.\n\nHis mother struggled to raise him and his brothers on her own. His father escaped from prison — twice — and had little more contact with them, relatives say. As they grew older, Stephen, the eldest, and the youngest brother, Eric, kept in touch, but Stephen Paddock drifted almost completely out of touch with his two other brothers, Bruce and Patrick.\n\nEric said that Stephen stopped talking to his brother Bruce because Bruce used to beat him up when they were kids and that Stephen stopped talking to Patrick because they’re very different people.\n\nEven with Eric he never talked much. They created a lucrative real estate investment business together, but Stephen would only text Eric now and then.\n\n“We didn’t talk much. We talked when there was something to talk about,” Eric Paddock said. “Steve had no help. Steve did not take help. He was a stand-alone guy.”\n\nChoking up as he talked, Eric said, “Steve was like a dad surrogate. He took me camping. I liked my brother. He was a good guy.”\n\nHigh school\n\nStephen Paddock went to John H. Francis Polytechnic High School in the Los Angeles suburbs, his brother said.\n\nJudy Smith Nelson, a retired federal worker living in Las Vegas, was stunned when she first saw that she and the alleged shooter were the same age — 64. Then a friend texted her a picture from an old high school yearbook.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it. I recognized the face. We had been classmates,” Nelson said Tuesday.\n\nAs investigators continued searching for a motive, anyone who had come into contact with Paddock over more than four decades began to wrestle with what they knew of the man and whether there had ever been clues of what would come.\n\n[Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock was a high-stakes gambler who ‘kept to himself’ before massacre]\n\nFormer California state senator Richard Alarcon, who had gotten his start as student body president of John H. Francis Polytechnic High School in 1971, posted a note to friends on Facebook on Tuesday saying he remembered playing basketball with Paddock at a neighborhood court.\n\nAnother classmate remembered Paddock showing up at a 20-year reunion and repeatedly angling to talk to her.\n\nNelson, in Las Vegas, fished through an old box of keepsakes and found a 10-year reunion program that contained a one-line description that each classmate had written. Paddock’s read: “Single, accountant, has traveled to Hollywood, lives in Sepulveda [Calif.]”\n\n“We’re all just reeling, and here I have kind of a personal connection, being that we walked the same grounds, we were from the same area,” Nelson said.\n\nAfter high school, Paddock attended Cal State Northridge. He was married and divorced twice.

Rather, they said, he was expressing genuine frustration with Qatar’s record and making sure it followed through on the commitments it made in backing a new joint Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, which the president announced last month in Riyadh.\n\n“The U.S. still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately, keeping with the principles that the president laid out in terms of defeating terror financing,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.\n\nMr. Spicer denied that the president was taking sides. He said Mr. Trump had had a “very productive” discussion with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the 37-year-old emir of Qatar, during his visit to Riyadh. But another person briefed on the conversation said it had been noticeably colder than the president’s meetings with other gulf leaders.\n\nIn Washington, Qatar’s ambassador, Meshal bin Hamad al-Thani, expressed surprise at Mr. Trump’s tweets. “No one approached us directly and said, ‘Look, we have problems with this and this and this,’” he said in an interview with The Daily Beast.\n\nThere was little immediate threat to American military facilities in Qatar, administration officials and outside analysts said, not least because Qatar views America’s military presence as an insurance policy against the aggressive moves of its neighbors.\n\nBut the mood there was jittery. Government officials and news outlets described the cutoff of diplomatic relations, travel and trade as a “siege” and even as an attempt at a coup.\n\nThose jitters have been intensified by suspicions that Russia was behind a cyberattack that published fake information on Qatar’s state news agency — a claim the United States is investigating, according to an official briefed on the inquiry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official said it was unclear whether the hackers were state-sponsored.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/world/middleeast/trump-qatar-saudi-arabia.html","1496721600.0"
"Poland may be stripped of EU voting rights over judicial independence\nThe EU is on the brink of taking the nuclear option of stripping Poland of its voting rights in Brussels in response to plans by its rightwing government to “abolish” the independence of the country’s judiciary.\n\n\n\nFrans Timmermans, the first vice-president of the European commission, accused Warsaw of seeking to put judges under full political control as he warned that the EU was “very close” to triggering article 7, a never-before-used sanction in the treaties that allows a member state’s voting rights in the council of ministers to be suspended.\n\nPoland’s ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) has been in almost constant conflict with the European commission since it was elected. In recent weeks the Polish government has proposed a series of reforms that would give ministers power over the appointment of judges and members of the country’s supreme court.\n\nThe first step in the EU triggering article 7 is an assessment of whether there has been a breach of fundamental rights, which could be launched as early as next week on the recommendation of the commission. “What we decide next week depends on developments also this week,” Timmermans said, as he called for fresh dialogue with Warsaw.\n\nThe Guardian view on Poland and Hungary: heading the wrong way | Editorial Read more\n\nShould a breach of fundamental rights be found, a motion to suspend Poland’s voting rights would then need to win the support of member states under the EU’s system of qualified majority voting. Two-thirds of the European parliament would also need to give its consent.\n\nTimmermans told reporters in Brussels that the recent proposal from the Polish government to increase political control of the judiciary was a grave threat to the fundamental values of the EU.\n\n“These laws considerably increase the systemic threat to the rule of law in Poland. Each individual law, if adopted, would seriously erode the independence of the Polish judiciary. Collectively they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government.\n\nQ&A Why does the Polish government want to appoint judges? Show Hide The attempt by Poland's Law and Justice party to take control of the judicial system should be seen as part of a wider campaign to dismantle democratic checks and balances on the government’s actions, from its takeover of state media to its capture of the country’s constitutional tribunal.\n\nJarosław Kaczyński, PiS’s leader, has developed a theory known in Poland as ‘impossibilism’, the idea that no serious reform of Polish society and institutions is possible due to these checks and balances, and what he describes as the vested interests of liberal elites and foreigners intent on exploiting the country.\n\n“Under these reforms judges will serve at the pleasure of political leaders, and be dependent upon them, from their appointment to their pension.”\n\nThe commissioner added: “I think every citizen wants to have, if they need to, a day in court without having to say, ‘Hmm, is this judge going to get a call from a minister telling him what to do?’.”\n\nTimmermans said he was confident he would have the support of member states should he recommend the triggering of article 7.\n\nIn Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, an MP with the opposition Civic Platform party and a former Europe minister, said Poland was being pushed to the margins of the EU by its authoritarian government.\n\nHe said: “It’s absolutely clear that patience is running out, not only in the European commission, but also in many European capitals.\n\n“The initiation of article 7 would be unprecedented, and it would show quite clearly how marginalised the current government is in the European Union.”\n\nTimmermans, a former Dutch minister who has been the subject of personal attacks by Polish ministers over his tough stance with Poland in recent months, said he had written earlier this month to Warsaw about his concerns, but appeals for the proposed laws not to be pursued had been ignored. Two of the four pieces of legislation in question have since been adopted by parliament.\n\nTimmermans said any concerns that triggering article 7 would push Poland to follow the UK out of the union would not be an obstacle to the EU taking action. He insisted there was “no way” the Polish people would ever choose to leave the union.\n\nThe commissioner also called on the Polish government to respect the right of journalists to do their job, after a Brussels-based TV journalist was accused by state-controlled Polish TV of asking politically motivated questions with intent “to harm Poland” after she sought information from the European commission about its intentions with regard to protecting the rule of law.\n\n“There are lot of emotions around this,” he said. “A lot of personal attacks, people’s personal credibility or integrity has been put to discussion, mine, other people’s. I can take it. They should take their best shot. But what should not be happening is that journalists should be intimidated.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The president, Andrzej Duda, gives a speech about the bill on Poland’s supreme court in Warsaw. Photograph: Jacek Turczyk/EPA\n\nAndrzej Duda, Poland’s PiS-aligned president, had sought to calm the situation on Tuesday evening, as crowds gathered outside the presidential palace for a candlelit vigil to demand he veto the supreme court legislation.\n\nIn a televised address, he said he would only sign the supreme court bill if legislation passed last week giving parliament control of the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), a hitherto independent body responsible for appointing Polish judges, were amended.\n\nUnder Duda’s proposal, appointments to the KRS would require a three-fifths majority in parliament, rather than a simple majority as contained in the present legislation, meaning that as parliament is presently constituted, Law and Justice would not be able to appoint judges by itself.\n\n“The judiciary is a very serious issue. It needs to be reformed – but wisely,” he said, arguing that his aim was “to avoid accusations that the KRS … is working under a political dictate.”\n\n\n\nHowever, Timmermans suggested that the president had not gone far enough. Under Duda’s proposal a coalition of Law and Justice and affiliated rightwing parties would still be able to push through appointments to the body. The supreme court legislation before parliament envisages “silent consent” for judicial appointments should the KRS not express a view within 14 days, meaning that a paralysed council would still give the justice minister the power of appointment over the supreme court.\n\n\n\n“Duda’s proposal does not change the essential mechanisms of the three combined legal acts, which grant the government political control over the judiciary,” said Mikołaj Pietrzak, chair of the Warsaw Bar Association. “It’s not constitutional, and it’s not satisfactory. It’s just smoke and mirrors.”\n\nThe European commission is also preparing infringement proceedings against Poland for breaches in EU law. Asked whether Hungary – whose rightwing prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has also repeatedly clashed with the commission – could also be in line for the ultimate sanction, Timmermans said the nature of Poland’s breaches was of a far more serious nature.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/19/poland-may-lose-eu-voting-rights-over-judicial-independence","1500436800.0"
"Comey furious at lack of respect White House showed, sources say\nFormer FBI Director James Comey was furious at the lack of respect the White House showed him in the way he was fired, sources have told ABC News.\n\nInterested in James Comey? Add James Comey as an interest to stay up to date on the latest James Comey news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAssociates say he is simmering at some of the comments directed at him by White House staffers, who have used words like 'atrocities' to describe his actions as director.\n\nOne person close to the former director said that President Trump calling Comey a 'showboat' and suggesting he is not 'competent' has required Comey to show considerable restraint.\n\n'Look, he's a showboat. He's a grandstander,' Trump said about Comey in an interview with NBC's Lester Holt on Thursday. 'The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that.'\n\nA source said they expect that at some point Comey will respond to Trump -- but it is uncertain when that would be. For now, Comey has taken a few days to gather himself, particularly given how caught off guard he was by the timing of the firing.\n\nThe only public statement from Comey since his dismissal came in the form of a letter he delivered to former FBI colleagues on Wednesday.\n\n'I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all,' he wrote. 'I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed. I hope you won't either. It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.'\n\nTo announce Comey's firing, Trump had a dismissal letter hand delivered to the FBI's building in Washington, although the former FBI Director learned of his firing from an aide as Comey was away in California on a recruiting trip for the bureau at the time.\n\nSources say that inside the FBI, many agents feel Comey has been treated shabbily. While there are those who disagreed with some of his tactics, he was nonetheless broadly popular in the bureau and respected.\n\nWhile the sources added that this has been a tumultuous week, with many employees of the bureau thrown off balance, there is also a degree of resolve settling in.\n\nIn the meantime, some individuals associated with the bureau have publicly rallied to protect Comey's name.\n\nDuring a hearing on Thursday, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey was held in high regard in the organization, despite White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying during a press briefing on Wednesday that 'the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director.'\n\n'I can tell you also that Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day,' McCabe said when asked about Comey.\n\nMcCabe's assessment about Comey's level of support was subsequently backed up by the FBI Agents Association.\n\n'Director Comey enjoyed broad support and respect within the Bureau,' Thomas F. O'Connor, the association's president, said in a statement released Thursday. 'He was a consistent and strong advocate for Agents. As we move forward, Agents continue to do our work with the same level of professionalism and commitment that the American people expect and deserve.'","http://abcnews.go.com/US/comey-furious-lack-respect-white-house-showed-sources/story?id=47367073","None"
"Hawaii Signs Legislation To Implement Goals Of Paris Climate Accord Anyway\nHawaii Signs Legislation To Implement Goals Of Paris Climate Accord Anyway\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cathy Bussewitz/AP Cathy Bussewitz/AP\n\nHawaii's governor has signed a bill that adopts goals of the Paris climate agreement, despite President Trump's announcement last week that the U.S. is pulling out of the global accord.\n\n'Reducing greenhouse emissions in Hawaii is now the law — the state law,' reports Hawaii Public Radio's Bill Dorman. 'While the specifics are a bit vague, the political message is clear: to keep pace with environmental commitments made as part of the Paris accord.'\n\nGov. David Ige signed the Senate bill on Tuesday, saying he was motivated by the evidence of climate change visible every day in Hawaii.\n\n'We are the testing grounds. ... We are especially aware of the limits of our natural environment,' Ige said before signing the document. 'Tides are getting higher, biodiversity is shrinking, coral is bleaching, coastlines are eroding, weather is becoming more extreme. We must acknowledge these realities at home. That is why Hawaii is united in its political leadership on tackling climate change.'\n\nThe law commits the state to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to align with the principles and goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nState Sen. J. Kalani English, who introduced the bill, said the measure 'gives us legal basis to continue adaptation and mitigation strategies for Hawai'i, despite the Federal government's withdrawal from the treaty.'\n\nIt also creates a commission to establish strategies to combat climate change and develop plans to manage the impact of rising sea levels.\n\nIge signed a separate bill Tuesday establishing a Carbon Farming Task Force, aimed at identifying 'agricultural and aquacultural practices to improve soil health and promote carbon sequestration.'\n\nWhile the state says it is the first to pass legislation in support of Paris after Trump's withdrawal announcement, other governors have pledged to uphold the agreement inside their states. Hawaii is joining at least 12 other states that have formed the U.S. Climate Alliance and promised to remain committed to the goals in the Paris deal.\n\nIn 2015, 195 countries agreed in Paris to set individual targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with the shared goal of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nWhile announcing his controversial decision, Trump said he was motivated by a campaign pledge to put American workers first. As The Two-Way reported, he stated that the agreement gives other countries 'an economic edge over the United States.'\n\nOnly two countries are not part of the global agreement — Syria and Nicaragua.\n\nTrump's announcement also prompted more than 1,200 business leaders, mayors and college presidents to stress that they planned to continue working towards the goals set in Paris.\n\nThe state of Hawaii is also challenging Trump's travel ban in federal court, saying it violates the Constitution and discriminates against travelers on the basis of religion.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/07/531882630/hawaii-signs-legislation-to-implement-goals-of-paris-climate-accord-anyway","1496808000.0"
"Landmines placed in the path of Rohingya refugees on Myanmar border\n(CNN) Bangladesh summoned the Myanmar ambassador Wednesday to urge an end to the violence that has engulfed the region and to raise concerns about reports of landmines being laid along the border between the two countries.\n\nAt least 164,000 ethnic Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar since August 25, according to the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) of humanitarian agencies in Bangladesh. The United Nations expects that number to jump to 300,000 by the end of the year.\n\nOn Wednesday, a senior Bangladeshi border guard, who did not want to be named, told CNN that one of his guards reported an incident from Monday in which two Rohingyas fleeing Myanmar were injured by separate landmines. They were carried across to the Bangladesh side of the border and are now in a hospital receiving treatment.\n\n'That happened on the Myanmar side in the north of the border area,' the senior border guard said.\n\n'Some mines were placed there, then someone stepped into it, and it exploded, and a few Rohingyas got injured,' he said, adding that a woman lost her leg and a boy also suffered injuries.\n\n'It's possible the Myanmar military has planted the mines. There is no one else who could do it,' he said.\n\nThe senior guard said some of the Rohingyas had learned how to defuse the mines.\n\nA humanitarian official in the city of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, confirmed hearing reports of landmine injuries.\n\nMore than 400 killed in recent violence\n\nAt least 414 people have now been killed in violence in Rakhine State in recent weeks, according to a statement published by Myanmar's government.\n\nMyanmar state media has blamed local 'terrorists' for placing mines in Rakhine State -- where Rohingyas are concentrated -- although not specifically on the border.\n\nPhotos of a Rohingya man holding mines on the Myanmar side of the border were sent to CNN by activists and examined by a mine expert, who confirmed that the two objects are PMN1 antipersonnel devices.\n\nAn expert said the objects pictured being held by an activist are PMN1 antipersonnel devices.\n\n'I can state with 100% certainty that the two objects being held up in the photograph are PMN1 antipersonnel landmines,' said Chris Clark, global director of operations at UK-based Dynasafe Area Clearance Group, who said the Russian-made devices are one of the most common types of landmines around the world.\n\n'The fact that it is in Myanmar is not at all unusual. It would be extremely usual for them to have access to that type of mine. That is most certainly not a handmade mine.'\n\nClark also said that it is possible that some of the Rohingya could have learned how defuse mines, though he stressed that those seen in the photograph were still live.\n\nGovernment puts blame on 'terrorists'\n\nThe government of Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, blames 'terrorists' for starting the violence that has shaken the region.

"Exclusive: Secret witness in Senate Clinton probe is ex-lobbyist for Russian firm\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans say their investigation of Hillary Clinton’s role in approving a deal to sell U.S. uranium mines to a Russian company hinges in part on the testimony of a secret informant in a bribery and extortion scheme inside the same company.\n\nWarning signs are displayed near Uranium One and Anfield's 'Shootaring Canyon Uranium Mill' facility sits outside Ticaboo, Utah, U.S., November 13, 2017. Picture taken November 13, 2017. REUTERS/George Frey\n\nThe Senate committee searching for Clinton’s alleged wrongdoing is keeping their witness’s name cloaked. However, William D. Campbell, a lobbyist, confirmed to Reuters he is the informant who will testify and provide documents to Congress about the Obama Administration’s 2010 approval of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian company with uranium mines in the United States, to Russia’s Rosatom.\n\nAt the time of the sale, Campbell was a confidential source for the FBI in a Maryland bribery and kickback investigation of the head of a U.S. unit of Rosatom, the Russian state-owned nuclear power company. Campbell was identified as an FBI informant by prosecutors in open court and by himself in a publicly available lawsuit he filed last year.\n\n[Link to page from Campbell lawsuit tmsnrt.rs/2zZhZkM and full complaint tmsnrt.rs/2zXKMWD]\n\nIn a telephone interview, Campbell said he wanted to testify because of his concerns about Russia’s activities in the United States, but declined to comment further.\n\nCampbell’s lawyer, Victoria Toensing, who has not previously identified her client, said despite Campbell telling the government “how corrupt the company was,” Rosatom still got permission to buy Uranium One. She did not say what Campbell would reveal regarding any alleged wrongdoing by Clinton.\n\nClinton has said the Senate probe is an attempt to shift attention away from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s alleged role in Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. As the heat from Mueller’s investigation has intensified, Trump has repeatedly called for an inquiry into Clinton and the Russian uranium deal.\n\n“This latest iteration is simply more of the Right doing Trump’s bidding for him to distract from his own Russia problems,” said Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman.\n\nSome people who know Campbell are skeptical that he can shed much light on Uranium One. Two law enforcement officials with direct involvement in the Rosatom bribery case in which Campbell was an informant said they had no recollection or record of him mentioning the deal during their repeated interviews with him.\n\nAlso, although both Uranium One and the bribery cases involved Rosatom, the two cases involved different business units, executives and allegations, with little other apparent overlap, Reuters found in a review of the court records of the bribery case.\n\nUranium One and Anfield's 'Shootaring Canyon Uranium Mill' facility sits outside Ticaboo, Utah, U.S., November 13, 2017. Picture taken November 13, 2017. REUTERS/George Frey\n\nCampbell countered those who dismiss his knowledge of the Uranium One deal. “I have worked with the Justice Department undercover for several years, and documentation relating to Uranium One and political influence does exist and I have it,” Campbell said. He declined to give details of those documents.\n\nReuters was unable to learn when the closed-door testimony has been scheduled.\n\nTrump asked that a Justice Department gag order on Campbell stemming from the bribery case be lifted so that he can testify to congressional investigators, White House officials said.\n\nThe Justice Department has partially lifted that gag order.\n\nCAMPBELL TESTIMONY ‘CRITICAL’\n\nCampbell potentially now has a larger starring role in the Washington drama after the Justice Department said in a letter to Congress on Monday that it was considering appointing a special prosecutor to launch an investigation into Republican allegations of wrongdoing by Clinton, Trump’s former political rival, in the deal.\n\nUnder Clinton, the State Department was part of a nine-agency government Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that approved the purchase of Uranium One. Her critics, including Trump, allege large donations by people connected to the Uranium One deal made to her family’s foundation influenced the State Department’s decision to approve it.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nReuters has no evidence that Clinton orchestrated the approval of Uranium One.\n\nIn an email, Rosatom said the company had made no donations to the Clinton Foundation and had not asked others to do so. The foundation stressed the State Department was only one member of the committee that approved the deal and said Clinton had no personal involvement in the decision.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said in a letter to Toensing, Campbell’s lawyer, that her client appears to have information “critical to the Committee’s oversight of the Justice Department and its ongoing inquiry into the manner in which” the Uranium One sale was approved.\n\nBRIBERY SCHEME\n\nCampbell worked as an informant for federal authorities investigating Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official in charge of U.S. operations for Tenex, a unit of Rosatom. Authorities later accused Mikerin of taking bribes from a shipping company in exchange for contracts to transport Russian uranium into the United States. He pleaded guilty in federal court in Maryland and was sentenced to prison for four years.\n\nThe Justice Department had also initially charged Mikerin with extorting kickbacks from Campbell after hiring him as a $50,000-a-month lobbyist.\n\nProsecutors alleged Mikerin had demanded Campbell pay between one-third and half of that money back to him each month under threat of losing the contract and veiled warnings of violence from the Russians. The demand prompted Campbell to turn to the FBI in 2010, which gave its blessing for him to remain part of the scheme.\n\nFederal prosecutors were ready to use Campbell as a star witness against Mikerin, but they backed away after defense attorneys raised questions about Campbell’s credibility and whether he was a victim or had “entered into a business arrangement with eyes wide open,” according to court records.\n\nBefore it was taken down last year, the website of Campbell’s company, Sigma Transnational, did not suggest his firm was a lobbying powerhouse. The website listed four other employees and advisers, although one had died years earlier. A second employee listed said in a court document that she never worked for the company but had agreed in 2014 to pay Campbell to list her as an employee and allow her to use the Sigma name in a business deal. Campbell declined to comment on the staffing or his lobbying contract with Tenex.\n\nProsecutors dropped the extortion charges against Mikerin and never mentioned Campbell again in any charging documents. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the case. Campbell also declined to comment on the issue.\n\nReuters has been unable to learn why Tenex chose Campbell as its lobbyist. He acknowledged in lawsuit he filed in 2016 that he was hired despite the fact he “had no experience with nuclear fuel sales.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-clinton-informant-exclusive/exclusive-secret-witness-in-senate-clinton-probe-is-ex-lobbyist-for-russian-firm-idUSKBN1DG1SB","1510840813.0"
"Scientists Say Japanese Monkeys Are Having 'Sexual Interactions' With Deer\nScientists Say Japanese Monkeys Are Having 'Sexual Interactions' With Deer\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Noëlle Gunst Courtesy of Noëlle Gunst\n\nAdolescent female monkeys in Japan have repeatedly engaged in sexual behaviors with sika deer, for reasons that are not yet clear, according to researchers who study macaque behavior.\n\nThe study, published in the peer-reviewed Archives of Sexual Behavior, follows up on a single report from earlier this year of a male macaque mounting a female sika deer on Yakushima Island.\n\nThat report was intriguing, but a co-author of the new study told The Guardian it was essentially anecdotal. 'Even the sexual nature of this interaction was not clearly demonstrated,' said Noëlle Gunst, a researcher at the University of Lethbridge in Canada. So she and her colleagues sought to nail down the nature of the mounting.\n\nLooking at a different set of relationships — adolescent female monkeys and deer, particularly male deer, in Minoo, Japan — the researchers found interactions that definitely seemed to be sexual in nature. (The female monkeys were climbing onto the deer and grinding their genitals against the deer's backs. Yes, there's video.)\n\nJapanese macaques are known to ride deer like humans ride horses, for fun or transportation — behavior the deer seem to tolerate in exchange for grooming and discarded food. But these monkeys were up to something different.\n\nThe researchers compared the monkey-deer interactions, which happened during mating season, with homosexual monkey-monkey interactions, where female macaques mount each other. They paid close attention to the 'mounting postures' the monkeys assumed on the deer, and the vocalizations they made, to determine that the interactions were, in fact, sexual ... at least for the monkeys.\n\nSome of the deer shook the monkeys off and fled the situation. But adult male deer, in particular, were likely to just stand calmly as the female monkeys thrusted. In some cases, the male deer kept eating.\n\nFive of the female monkeys had 'successful heterospecific consortships' with deer. That is, they had 'a temporary, but exclusive, sexual association' with an individual from another species, with 'three or more mounts within a 10-minute period.'\n\nAll told there were 13 successful pairings — and 258 separate mounts.\n\nThere were eight failed attempts as well. In some of those cases, the monkey-deer interaction was interrupted because another young female macaque came along, 'successfully displaced the original adolescent female mounters and took over the deer to start their own heterospeciﬁc consortships,' the researchers noted. That was not a plot twist they had anticipated.\n\nAnd the interactions went beyond the mere moment of thrusting. The 'monkey-to-deer solicitations ... were persistent and conspicuous,' the researchers write. Young female monkeys would identify a 'particular target' and make calls that sound identical to the ones in monkey-on-monkey courtship.\n\nIf the deer avoided the interaction, 'the female monkeys often displayed sexually motivated tantrums which consisted of crouching on the ground, body spasms and screaming, while gazing at the deer,' the study found.\n\nSo. What does this all mean?\n\nSexual interactions between animals of different species are not unheard of (even when you take human behavior out of the equation). But most of them don't look like these monkey-deer consortships.\n\nOften the animals are of very similar, related species, and the mating might just be a case of mistaken identity. Clearly, that's not the case here. Writing with significant understatement, the researchers note that 'this interpretation is implausible in our case because the anatomical differences between Japanese macaques and sika deer are profound.'\n\nScientists have five theories about why the young monkeys might seek out sexual relationships with deer.\n\nFirst, it might be a way for a less-mature monkey to practice for future sex with other monkeys.\n\nSecond, it might be a less dangerous way for a young female macaque — physically smaller than male macaques — to have a sexual interaction. That's the 'safe sex' hypothesis, as the scientists put it. It's similar to one explanation for why young female macaques have sex with each other.\n\nThird, they might be an option for young macaques with no available sexual partners of their own species. Apparently adolescent female macaques are not the 'preferred' partner for male macaques and are 'routinely rejected.' This is what the researchers call the 'best of a bad job' hypothesis.\n\nFourth, it might be the result of nonsexual interactions, with macaques riding deer either for fun or for transport and discovering it's a source of genital stimulation that they then seek out on purpose.\n\nFinally, the researchers say, this might be a kind of cultural practice. Japanese macaques display different behaviors in different locations — some wash their food, or take hot-spring baths, or play with snowballs.\n\nAdolescent females grinding on the backs of deer might similarly be a cultural phenomenon. But it has only been observed at Minoo within the past few years.\n\n'The monkey-deer sexual interactions reported in our paper may reflect the early stage development of a new behavioural tradition at Minoo,' Gunst-Leca told The Guardian.\n\nAlternatively, the paper notes, it could be a 'short-lived fad.' Time will tell.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/15/571175252/scientists-say-japanese-monkeys-are-having-sexual-interactions-with-deer","1513314000.0"
"How to Help Puerto Rico and Other Islands After Hurricane Maria\nPhoto\n\nPuerto Rico is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis, economies across the Caribbean are on life support, and dozens of people are dead.\n\nThe region was still recovering from Hurricane Irma when it was pummeled last week by Hurricane Maria. Days after the storm passed, Puerto Rico is still without power and has spotty access to water. Other islands suffered similarly, raising fears of a potentially permanent exodus.\n\nThe region needs immediate and long-term help. A few of the groups collecting donations to provide such relief are listed below.\n\n(The Times has also published articles about helping the victims of Huricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and the earthquakes in Mexico. For those who are trying to figure out where to give and are feeling overwhelmed, here are some tips to guide your thinking.)\n\nLocal Charities\n\nThese are just a few local organizations that have vowed to help in recovery efforts. As discussed in detail below, it’s important to do your research before giving to any charity.\n\nUnidos, by the Hispanic Federation\n\nA coalition of elected officials in New York and Puerto Rico joined the Hispanic Federation, a Latino nonprofit, to launch this relief fund for Puerto Ricans affected by Maria. Proceeds will go to community and civic organizations in Puerto Rico, the group said.\n\nDominica Hurricane Relief Fund\n\nThe government of Dominica is collecting donations through JustGiving, a crowdfunding website. The money will go toward temporary roofing, blankets and non-perishable foods.\n\nFund for the Virgin Islands\n\nThe Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands, a nonprofit, is collecting donations through this fund, which will be used “both to support short-term relief efforts and to enhance the well-being of future generations.”\n\nGoFundMe\n\nThe crowdfunding website maintains a list of campaigns, many of them local, collecting donations for victims of the storm. Donors can give to a campaign or directly to GoFundMe, which will then distribute the money to the campaigns.\n\nUnidos por Puerto Rico\n\nThis initiative, from Beatriz Rosselló, the first lady of Puerto Rico, enlists private sector help in providing aid to those affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Donations are accepted through a variety of means, including PayPal.\n\nNational and Global Charities\n\nEach group below has earned the top rating, four stars, from Charity Navigator, which grades charities based on transparency and financial health.\n\nAll Hands Volunteers\n\nAll Hands works with local volunteers and groups to respond to natural disasters. With Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, it is focusing its efforts on the U.S. Virgin Islands. “Our help is needed in the islands, so that’s where we’ll be,” said Erik Dyson, the group’s chief executive.\n\nAmeriCares\n\nThe relief and development organization, which provides health services to those in need, said that it was working with officials in Puerto Rico to stock emergency shelters with medical supplies. Earlier in the week, it had airlifted $1.8 million worth of medicine and supplies to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nCatholic Relief Services\n\n\n\nDonations to the faith-based group will help to provide shelter, water, tarps, tents, kitchen kits and other supplies to families affected by the storm, it said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It also said it was working to provide insulin to 120 displaced dialysis patients.\n\nGlobalGiving\n\nThis crowdfunding website connects donors to nonprofits and companies around the world. Donations will be spent first on the immediate needs of victims and then on longer-term recovery efforts “run by local, vetted organizations,” according to the website.\n\nHeart to Heart International\n\nThis group was already providing medicine, medical care and aid to victims of storms in Texas, the Florida Keys and Haiti, when it sent two teams to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. It also sent thousands of health and hygiene kits to St. Lucia and St. Martin last week.\n\nInternational Medical Corps\n\nThe group has been working with local authorities to provide emergency care after Hurricane Irma and said it had moved medical supplies into place ahead of Hurricane Maria.\n\nOne America Appeal\n\nAll five living former presidents have united to raise money for One America Appeal, a fund administered by the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation. Donations will be distributed to a variety of funds aimed at helping storm victims in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Texas and Florida. Those groups include two listed above: Unidos por Puerto Rico and the Fund for the Virgin Islands.\n\nAnd many more...\n\n\n\nThere are, of course, many charities collecting donations to help victims of Hurricane Maria, including several others that earned four stars from Charity Navigator. They include: the faith-based ICNA Relief, International Relief Teams, Project Hope and MedShare.\n\nDo Your Research\n\nIt’s important to research charities to fully understand how they might — or might not — spend your money. Charity Navigator, as we mentioned, is a good resource.\n\nBut high ratings may not always be enough. Despite earning three stars from Charity Navigator, the American Red Cross has faced strong criticism in recent years for its response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, stemming from a ProPublica and National Public Radio investigation that suggested that the group had badly mismanaged relief efforts. (The Red Cross has disputed the criticism.) The organization also recently apologized for temporarily suspending registrations for financial assistance for victims of Hurricane Harvey.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/world/americas/hurricane-maria-donate-charity.html","1506052800.0"
"Exclusive: VW moves to secure cobalt supplies in shift to electric cars\nLONDON (Reuters) - Germany’s Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is moving to secure long-term supplies of cobalt, a vital component of rechargeable batteries, as the group accelerates its ambitious shift to electric cars.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An electric Volkswagen car is plugged into a recharging point in central London, Britain November 10, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville /File Photo\n\nCobalt industry sources told Reuters that VW, the world’s largest automaker, has asked producers to submit proposals on supplying the material for up to 10 years from 2019.\n\nVolkswagen, which decided on the strategic shift to electric vehicles (EVs) after it was engulfed in the “dieselgate” scandal, plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 to challenge pioneer Tesla in creating a mass market.\n\nThe company, which aims to make up to three million EVs a year by 2025, wants all the cobalt tender proposals submitted by the end of September. “The tender doesn’t actually tell you how much cobalt they want. They tell you how many EVs they want to make, you have to work out the cobalt content yourself,” one cobalt industry source said.\n\nVolkswagen did not respond to Reuters questions on the details of the tender but noted that the group would need more than 150 gigawatt hours of battery capacity annually by 2025 for its electric vehicles.\n\nThis would mean major purchases of necessary materials. “The procurement project is one of the largest in the history of the automotive industry, with a total order volume of over 50 billion euros,” it said in a statement. “That will meet the Group’s needs for the first wave of e-mobility.”\n\nDemand for cobalt is expected to soar in the coming years due to the electric vehicle revolution as governments around the world crack down on pollution. Volkswagen is under particular pressure as it had been slow to embrace electric cars and self-driving technology until admitting two years ago to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests.\n\nBattery and auto manufacturers need to sign multi-year deals to secure supplies of raw materials including cobalt and lithium.\n\nA VW logo is seen in front of the main building of the Volkswagen brand at the Volkswagen headquarters during a media tour to present Volkswagen's so called 'Blaue Fabrik' (Blue Factory) environmental program, in Wolfsburg, Germany May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) produces roughly 65 percent of global cobalt supplies estimated at around 100,000 tonnes this year. Canada, China, Russia, Australia and Zambia are also major sources.\n\nAt the company level, the market is dominated by Glencore , which produced more than 28,000 tonnes last year.\n\nReuters recently reported that Glencore had signed a major deal to sell up to 20,000 tonnes of cobalt products to a Chinese firm, a move that would help Volkswagen secure car batteries for its shift to electric vehicles.\n\nMISUNDERSTANDING?\n\nAccording to the cobalt industry sources, Volkswagen said wanted all contracts agreed by the end of the year.\n\nElectric vehicles use rechargeable batteries containing cobalt, a byproduct of copper and nickel output, which boosts energy density and extends battery life. This allows automakers to offer guarantees between eight and 10 years.\n\nThe Volkswagen tender specifies the chemistry for the battery will initially be six parts nickel, two parts cobalt and two parts manganese or 6:2:2, but that it could at some stage switch to 8:1:1.\n\n“They want a fixed price, which won’t work for people who need security and they want to reserve the right to not take metal they don’t need,” another cobalt source said. “They want producers to take all the risks ... they want an option at low prices, for long maturities at zero cost.”\n\nCobalt metal is around $30 a lb, its highest since October 2008 and up from less than $10 in December 2015.\n\nVolkswagen has said that by 2025 it would roll out 80 new electric car models across the group, which also includes the Audi, Seat, Skoda and Porsche brands, up from a previous goal of 30. It wants to offer an electric version of each of its 300 group models by 2030.\n\nAnalysts estimate each battery uses between 8-12 kg of cobalt. That would mean VW will need 24-36 million kg a year for three million EVs, which at current prices would total $1.6-$2.4 billion.\n\nThe sources said the wording of the tender suggests it will probably have also gone to lithium producers, chemical producers and battery makers.\n\n“There’s a section on sustainability... asking what processes are in place to make sure the cobalt does not come from child labour in the DRC,” one said.\n\nChild labour is a reference to artisanal mining in places such as the DRC, where individuals mine independently to produce metal, often illegally and under poor health and safety conditions.\n\nUBS expects global sales of electric vehicles in 2025 to reach 14.2 million units or 13.7 percent of the total from under one million units and less than one percent this year.\n\nAnalysts at CRU Group forecast the battery sector will need more than 75,000 tonnes of cobalt a year by 2025, up from around 41,000 tonnes this year.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-cobalt-evs-exclusive/exclusive-vw-moves-to-secure-cobalt-supplies-in-shift-to-electric-cars-idUSKCN1BX1RE","1506117569.0"

"China building network of refugee camps along border with North Korea\nDocument suggests at least five camps are being set up as Beijing prepares for possible influx of refugees should Kim Jong-un’s regime collapse\n\nChina is quietly building a network of refugee camps along its 880-mile (1,416km) border with North Korea as it braces for the human exodus that a conflict or the potentially messy collapse of Kim Jong-un’s regime might unleash.\n\nThe existence of plans for the camps, first reported in English by the Financial Times last week, emerged in an apparently leaked internal document from a state-run telecoms giant that appears to have been tasked with providing them with internet services.\n\nQ&A Why does the North Korean regime pursue a nuclear programme? Show Hide Much of the regime’s domestic legitimacy rests on portraying the country as under constant threat from the US and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan.\n\nTo support the claim that it is in Washington’s crosshairs, North Korea cites the tens of thousands of US troops lined up along the southern side of the demilitarised zone – the heavily fortified border dividing the Korean peninsula. Faced with what it says are US provocations, North Korea says it has as much right as any other state to develop a nuclear deterrent. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un is also aware of the fate of other dictators who lack nuclear weapons.\n\nThe China Mobile document, which has circulated on social media and overseas Chinese websites since last week, reveals plans for at least five refugee camps in Jilin province.\n\nThe document, which the Guardian could not independently verify, says: “Due to cross-border tensions … the [Communist] party committee and government of Changbai county has proposed setting up five refugee camps in the county.”\n\nIt gives the names and locations of three such facilities: Changbai riverside, Changbai Shibalidaogou and Changbai Jiguanlizi. The New York Times reported that centres for refugees were also planned in the cities of Tumen and Hunchun.\n\nA spokesman for China’s foreign ministry declined to confirm the camps’ existence at a regular press briefing on Monday but did not deny they were being built. “I haven’t seen such reports,” Lu Kang told reporters.\n\nThe question was purged from the foreign ministry’s official transcript of the briefing, as regularly happens with topics raised by foreign journalists that are considered politically sensitive or inconvenient.\n\nNorth Korea fortifies part of border where defector escaped Read more\n\nThe leaked document contains the name and telephone number of a China Mobile employee who drafted it but calls to that number went unanswered on Tuesday. The construction of the camps appears to reflect growing concern in Beijing about the potential for political instability – or even regime collapse – in North Korea.\n\nCheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist from Renmin University in Beijing, said while he could not confirm whether the document was genuine, it would be irresponsible for China not to make such preparations.\n\n“Tensions are high on the Korean peninsula … it is on the brink of war. As a major power and a neighbouring country, China should make plans for all eventualities.”\n\nJiro Ishimaru, a Japanese documentary maker who runs a network of citizen journalists inside North Korea and on the Chinese side of the border, said a contact in Changbai county had recently told him that while they had not seen signs of camps being built there, they “had heard there are plans to build a facility”.\n\nTensions on the Korean peninsula have soared this year as the US president, Donald Trump, has stepped up pressure on his North Korean counterpart and Pyongyang has accelerated its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nTrump has baited Kim with the nickname “Little Rocket Man” and threats of military action, while Kim has responded with insults of his own, and a succession of nuclear and missile tests that have brought two new rounds of UN sanctions.\n\nFollowing its latest intercontinental ballistic missile test on 29 November, Pyongyang claimed the ability to strike anywhere on US soil.\n\n'Quite backwards': Chinese tourists gawk at impoverished North Koreans Read more\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian in Beijing on Monday, Dennis Rodman, the NBA star turned would-be peacemaker, played down fears of a catastrophic nuclear conflict and denied Kim, whom he calls his friend, was “going to try and bomb or kill anyone in America”.\n\n“We ain’t gonna die, man, come on, no … It’s not like that,” Rodman insisted, urging Trump to use him as an intermediary to engage with Kim. He described the verbal war between Trump and Kim as “a chess game” that should not be taken too seriously.\n\nBeijing seems less certain. Last week one official newspaper in Jilin, the Chinese province closest to North Korea’s nuclear test site, hinted at that nervousness with a full-page article offering tips on how to react to a nuclear incident.\n\nIodine tablets, masks and soap were useful allies in the event of such a catastrophe, readers of the Jilin Daily learned.\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Zhen and Justin McCurry in Tokyo.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/china-refugee-camps-border-north-korea","1513054800.0"
"‘Last Night in Sweden’? Trump’s Remark Baffles a Nation\nAs the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet noted, Twitter users were quick to ridicule Mr. Trump’s remark, with joking references to the Swedish Chef, the “Muppets” character; Swedish meatballs; and Ikea, the furniture giant.\n\nMr. Trump did not state, per se, that a terrorist attack had taken place in Sweden. But the context of his remarks — he mentioned Sweden right after he chastised Germany, a destination for refugees and asylum seekers fleeing war and deprivation — suggested that he thought it might have.\n\n“Sweden,” Mr. Trump said. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”\n\nHe then invoked the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels and Nice, France, last year, to make an argument for tightening scrutiny of travelers and asylum seekers. “We’ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people,” he said. “There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we’re going to keep our country safe.”\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, tried to clarify the president’s remarks Sunday, saying Mr. Trump did not mean to suggest that a particular attack had happened the night before, but rather was talking about crime in general in Sweden.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Trump offered his own clarification, writing on Twitter, “My statement as to what’s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.”\n\nIn that story, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed Ami Horowitz, a filmmaker who asserts that migrants in Sweden have been associated with a crime wave. “They oftentimes try to cover up some of these crimes,” Mr. Horowitz said, arguing that those who try to tell the truth about the situation are shouted down as racists and xenophobes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(Mr. Carlson interjected, “The masochism of the West knows no bounds at all.”)\n\nMr. Horowitz said, “Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already.”\n\nIt was not clear what he was referring to. In 2010, a suicide bomber struck central Stockholm, injuring two people. The bomber, Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, 28, was an Iraqi-born Swede who had developed an affinity for Al Qaeda. But that attack occurred long before the current wave of migrants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

It found numerous exaggerations and distortions, including false reports that Shariah law was predominant in parts of the country and that some immigrant-heavy neighborhoods were considered “no-go zones” by the police.\n\nBreitbart News, the right-wing website once led by Stephen K. Bannon, now Mr. Trump’s senior strategist, has published numerous stories alleging that migrants have been responsible for a surge in crime and for a wave of sexual assaults. Swedish officials have said that their statistics do not justify such sweeping assertions, and that the country has a high number of sexual assault reports relative to other European countries because more victims come forward, not because there is more violence.\n\nMr. Selin said the news reports “were highly exaggerated and not based in facts,” adding, “Some of the stories were very popular to spread in social media by people who have the same kind of agenda — that countries should not receive so many refugees.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for the cover-up alleged by Mr. Horowitz, Mr. Selin said: “That kind of claim has been in the political debate for 15 years now. But nobody has been able to prove there is a cover-up. On the contrary, the fact is that crime rates are going down.”\n\nHe added: “Swedish authorities have nothing to gain from hiding the truth.

"Police Arrest Man In Fatal 'Swatting' Prank\nPolice Arrest Man In Fatal 'Swatting' Prank\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Glendale, Calif., Police Department/AP Glendale, Calif., Police Department/AP\n\nTyler Barriss, 25, suspected of phoning in a false 911 call that led to a police raid and the fatal shooting of a father of two, was arrested Friday afternoon in South Los Angeles, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman tells NPR.\n\nBarriss is being held in a Los Angeles County jail without bail, according to LAPD Officer Mike Lopez.\n\nThe deadly prank began Thursday when a 911 operator in Wichita, Kan., received a call from a man who claimed he had shot his father and was now holding the rest of his family hostage. When police surrounded a house at the valid Wichita address, a confused 28-year-old man, Andrew Finch, stumbled out his front door. Within seconds, he had been fatally shot.\n\n'Due to actions of a prankster, we have an innocent victim. If the false police call had not been made, we would not have been there,' Wichita Deputy Police Chief Troy Livingston told reporters Friday.\n\n'We believe this incident is a case of swatting,' said Livingston, referring to an extreme practical joke that has made headlines in recent years. Instigators call 911 operators within close proximity to their victims — frequently using caller ID spoofing or other measures to conceal their true location — and report severely volatile situations that may warrant a SWAT team response. (Hostage-taking scenarios are common.) The goal is to surprise their unwitting victims with a full-force police response at their doors. Prominent celebrities like Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher have been swatted, but the prank is most well-known in video gaming communities, where it has been used as a form of revenge.\n\nSpeculation surrounding the caller's motivation has swirled as numerous gamers told The Wichita Eagle that Thursday's episode was fallout from a dispute over the game Call of Duty. But Finch's mother told the Kansas paper that her son 'doesn't play video games' and had 'better things to do with his time.'\n\nThe call that sparked the fatal ordeal starts with an erratic male voice telling a 911 operator that he had observed an argument between his parents and then fired a handgun at his father. 'I shot him in the head, and he's not breathing anymore,' says the man on audio released by Wichita police. He says he has cornered his mother and little brother in a closet. 'I'm just pointing the gun at them, making sure they stay in the closet,' he continues. 'I already poured gasoline all over the house. I might just set it on fire ... in a little bit, I might.' He then lists the address where the victim, Finch, was present.\n\nOfficers soon flanked the house on three sides and readied themselves for a confrontation, Livingston said in his press conference. Finch appeared at the door to the house and, following verbal commands from the officers, stepped forward with his hands up. At numerous points, however, he reached for his waistband. Fearful that Finch was going for a firearm, an officer discharged one round, killing the father of two, said Livingston.\n\n'I heard my son scream, I got up and then I heard a shot,' Lisa Finch, the victim's mother told the Eagle. She says her son was unarmed. Finch says police later instructed her, her roommate and her granddaughter to come outside with their hands up, which meant stepping over Finch's 'dying' body.\n\nA little over two years ago, a man also named Tyler Barriss, 22 years old at the time, was arrested for calling a bomb threat into the KABC-TV studios in Los Angeles.\n\nThe FBI's office in Kansas City, Mo., says its agents are, at the request of local police, now involved in the investigation, The Associated Press reports.\n\nUMG Gaming, which runs tournaments of online video games including Call of Duty, also told the AP that the company 'is doing everything we can to assist the authorities.'\n\nAuthorities have become increasingly stringent in their responses to swatting incidents. Federal prosecutors pursued cases in Maryland and Connecticut in 2015.\n\nOfficials do, however, say that there are limits to what can be done to combat swatting. Trey Forgety of the National Emergency Number Association told NPR in 2013 that 911 operators all over the country face 600,000 calls a day, making spotting a fake one difficult.\n\n'We start from a position that every call must be treated as if it is a legitimate call for help,' Forgety said.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/30/574789231/police-arrest-suspect-in-fatal-swatting-prank","1514610000.0"
"Tesla Turns Power Back On At Children's Hospital In Puerto Rico\nTesla Turns Power Back On At Children's Hospital In Puerto Rico\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tesla Tesla\n\nTesla has used its solar panels and batteries to restore reliable electricity at San Juan's Hospital del Niño (Children's Hospital), in what company founder Elon Musk calls 'the first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico.'\n\nThe project came about after Puerto Rico was hit by two devastating and powerful hurricanes in September, and Musk reached out about Tesla helping.\n\nMusk's company announced its success in getting the hospital's power working again less than three weeks after Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello tweeted on Oct. 6, 'Great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities.'\n\nTesla's image of the project's solar array, in a parking lot next to the hospital, has been liked more than 84,000 times since it was posted to Instagram Tuesday.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk tweeted that some of his company's work is being rerouted so it could 'increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.'\n\nThe hospital's new system allows it to generate all the energy it needs, according to El Nuevo Dia. The facility has 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions; it also offers services to some 3,000 young patients, the newspaper says. As for who is paying for the power system, the head of the hospital tells Nuevo Dia that for now, it's a donation — and that after the energy crisis is over, a deal could make it permanent.\n\nBoth Rossello and the tech company tweeted about the project this week, with Tesla saying in a post, 'Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello' — and Rossello stating, 'A major contribution of @Tesla to the Hospital del Niño.'\n\nThe news of restoring permanent power at the hospital comes as millions of people in Puerto Rico continue to rely on generators for electricity. As of Wednesday morning, the Electric Power Authority reported that its power service was at 25 percent.\n\nThe task of rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid is expected to take months and to cost as much as $5 billion.\n\nLast week, the territory's electric and power authority signed a $300 million contract with Whitefish, a small and relatively young Montana company, to restore the power grid. The deal has sparked scrutiny and skepticism, as NPR's Laurel Wamsley and Nicky Ouellet of Montana Public Radio reported.\n\nTesla isn't the only tech company trying to help Puerto Rico; Google's parent company, Alphabet, has deployed balloons from its Project Loon to the territory, to help parts of the island reconnect after much of its phone system went down. The portable network can help phone users with both messaging and some web browsing.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/25/560045944/tesla-turns-power-back-on-at-childrens-hospital-in-puerto-rico","1508904000.0"
"Astronomers Strike Gravitational Gold In Colliding Neutron Stars\nAstronomers Strike Gravitational Gold In Colliding Neutron Stars\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robin Dienel/Carnegie Institution for Science Robin Dienel/Carnegie Institution for Science\n\nFor the first time, scientists have caught two neutron stars in the act of colliding, revealing that these strange smashups are the source of heavy elements such as gold and platinum.\n\nThe discovery, announced Monday at a news conference and in scientific reports written by some 3,500 researchers, solves a long-standing mystery about the origin of these heavy elements — which are found in everything from wedding rings to cellphones to nuclear weapons.\n\nIt's also a dramatic demonstration of how astrophysics is being transformed by humanity's newfound ability to detect gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time that are created when massive objects spin around each other and finally collide.\n\n'It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful it makes me want to cry. It's the fulfillment of dozens, hundreds, thousands of people's efforts, but it's also the fulfillment of an idea suddenly becoming real,' says Peter Saulson of Syracuse University, who has spent more than three decades working on the detection of gravitational waves.\n\nAlbert Einstein predicted the existence of these ripples more than a century ago, but scientists didn't manage to detect them until 2015. Until now, they'd made only four such detections, and each time the distortions in space-time were caused by the collision of two black holes.\n\nThat bizarre phenomenon, however, can't normally be seen by telescopes that look for light. Neutron stars, by contrast, spew out visible cosmic fireworks when they come together. These incredibly dense stars are as small as cities like New York and yet have more mass than our sun.\n\nIn this case, what scientists managed to spot was a pair of neutron stars that likely spent more than 11 billion years circling each other more and more closely before finally slamming together about 130 million years ago.\n\nHere's a rendering of the neutron-star collision Caltech/NASA/GSFC YouTube\n\nHere's how it actually looked to astronomers\n\nThis explosive impact created ripples in space-time that traveled all the way to Earth, arriving at 8:41 a.m. ET on Aug. 17 and setting off detectors in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory — whose founders won the Nobel Prize in physics earlier this month.\n\nThat morning, all of a sudden, scientists' cellphones began to ring.\n\n'A phone alarm went off in my pocket,' recalls David Shoemaker of MIT, a physicist who serves as the spokesman for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. He had been in a mundane organizational meeting, which was immediately abandoned. 'The morning was transformed from ordinary bureaucracy to a morning of slightly breathless discovery as we tried to figure out how we could most quickly get the news out to observers to try and make the most of this event.'\n\nWhat LIGO had seen did not look like the calling card of colliding black holes.\n\nImportantly, two seconds after the gravitational waves' detection, an orbiting NASA telescope registered an extremely powerful explosion called a gamma ray burst. It apparently came from the same region of the sky that had produced the gravitational waves.\n\n'That put us into a very high state of excitement,' Shoemaker says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption The Virgo collaboration/CCO 1.0 The Virgo collaboration/CCO 1.0\n\nQuickly, the LIGO team consulted with colleagues at Virgo, another gravitational wave detector located near Pisa, Italy. That lab had detected the waves, too, and their data helped pinpoint the exact patch of sky where astronomers should aim their telescopes.\n\nThe location was in the southern skies, so that meant the first place where astronomers could get to work was Chile. Astronomer Benjamin Shappee was there — and he was asleep.\n\n'I actually woke up in the afternoon, because I work all night when I'm observing, and I just looked at my phone and I saw it was just covered with emails about a new source that was discovered by LIGO,' says Shappee, a professor at the University of Hawaii who was a Hubble fellow at the Carnegie Observatories during the discovery. 'My first thought was just, 'We're in the perfect position to try to find this.' '\n\nHe and his colleagues began a mad scramble to figure out which galaxies to look at with which telescopes. As soon as the sun went down in Chile, they started searching for a new source of light among the familiar stars.\n\n'Almost right off the bat, maybe 15 minutes into observing, I get an email basically saying that they think they found something from the Swope [Telescope], which is amazing,' Shappee says. 'And then I get an email almost immediately from Josh Simon, also saying he was on the same galaxy, took another image and found the same source, and it's real. And so at that point, I said, 'This is almost too easy.' '\n\nLess than 11 hours after the gravitational-wave detectors sounded the alarm, astronomers had their first glimpse of this never-before-seen event involving the neutron stars.\n\nThe Carnegie team worked quickly to make observations, because it had only about an hour until this spot was no longer visible in the sky. 'It was probably the most surreal experience of my professional career. It was just completely unexpected, out of the blue,' Shappee says.\n\nOther groups were searching, too, with other telescopes.\n\n'We started scanning the region of the sky where LIGO told us the gravitational waves came from, and it took us 45 minutes until we found it,' says Edo Berger, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. 'It was an incredibly amazing moment, because it just stood out there. It was kind of like searching for treasure and then seeing X marks the spot.'\n\nWhat all the images showed was a brand-new point of light that started out blueish and then faded to red. This didn't completely match what theorists thought colliding neutron stars should look like — but it was all close enough that Daniel Kasen, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley, found the whole experience a little weird.\n\n'Even though this was an event that had never been seen before in human history, what it looked like was deeply familiar because it resembled very closely the predictions we had been making,' Kasen says. 'Before these observations, what happened when two neutron stars merged was basically just a figment of theorists' imaginations and their computer simulations.'\n\nHe spent late nights watching the data come in and says the colliding stars spewed out a big cloud of debris.\n\n'That debris is strange stuff. It's gold and platinum, but it's mixed in with what you'd call just regular radioactive waste, and there's this big radioactive waste cloud that just starts mushrooming out from the merger site,' Kasen says. 'It starts out small, about the size of a small city, but it's moving so fast — a few tenths of the speed of light — that after a day it's a cloud the size of the solar system.'\n\nAccording to his estimates, this neutron star collision produced around 200 Earth masses of pure gold, and maybe 500 Earth masses of platinum. 'It's a ridiculously huge amount on human scales,' Kasen says. He personally has a platinum wedding ring and notes that 'it's crazy to think that these things that seem very far out and kind of exotic actually impact the world and us in kind of intimate ways.'\n\nThe discovery has consumed the astronomical community in recent weeks. 'By my count, 70 astronomical telescopes started looking for this event in the area of the sky that we found it,' says David Reitze, a physicist at Caltech who is executive director of the LIGO project. 'This event, in some sense, is the first event that we've seen in gravitational waves and in light. It's a new way to look at the universe.'\n\nWhat could gravitational waves help astronomers see next? 'If we were lucky, we would see a supernova from somewhere in our galaxy,' Reitze says, though he notes that these star explosions go off only every 50 years or so. Perhaps the next cataclysm on deck will be something like a black hole colliding with a neutron star.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/16/557557544/astronomers-strike-gravitational-gold-in-colliding-neutron-stars","1508126400.0"
"New DACA bill proposed by Republicans\nRepublican Senators Thom Tillis, James Lankford and Orrin Hatch unveiled their latest immigration reform effort, a first step toward fixing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program which the Trump administration recently announced it was rescinding.\n\nThe three senators announced the SUCCEED Act (Solution for Undocumented Children through Careers Employment Education and Defending our nation), which they called a 'fair and compassionate' merit-based solution to issues facing undocumented children currently in the U.S.\n\nThe #SUCCEEDAct is based on four core principles:\n\nCompassion.\n\nMerit.\n\nPrevention.\n\nFairness. pic.twitter.com/MFajCbLZeT — Senator Thom Tillis (@SenThomTillis) September 25, 2017\n\n'If you work hard, follow the law and pay your taxes, you can stay here permanently,' Sen. Tillis promised Dreamers.\n\nThe proposed legislation mandates that in order to receive 'conditional status' in the U.S., a recipient must be maintaining gainful employment, pursuing higher education or serving in the U.S. military.\n\nUnder the bill, eligibility for protective status includes having arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16 years, holding a high school diploma or equivalent, passing an extensive criminal background check, submitting biometric data to the Department of Homeland Security and being able to pay off any existing federal tax liabilities.\n\nTillis said it was very important that Congress not implement a policy that allows the line to be skipped, and the plan, he said, should also prevent 'chain migration,' a term used to describe how the immigration system prioritizes family members.\n\nAfter five years of gainful employment, earning a degree or military service, a recipient would then become eligible for a second round of 5-year protected status. After which, the Senators said an individual can then apply for a green card to jumpstart the naturalization process.\n\nWhile Tillis critiqued the DREAM Act, which was re-introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin, for not being conservative enough, and for the fact that it has 'failed every single time,' he told reporters on Monday that he was open to including Democrats in the immigration bill conversations.\n\n'We are willing to talk with anyone providing certainty to these children, let politics get checked at the door, let's provide something on a bipartisan basis to these children and young adults in this country,' said Tillis.\n\nHe added, noting his confidence in the bill's future, that 'on the whole, we have a bigger base to draw on in the Senate and a bigger base that's important to draw on in the House to get this to the president's desk.'\n\nMeanwhile, bill co-sponsor James Lankford of Oklahoma said immigration poses as an 'unresolved issue that continues to get harder every single year.'\n\nAlex Wong / Getty Images\n\nHe stressed that the SUCCEED Act was not a 'stand-alone bill,' and the greater issues of immigration need also need to be addressed.\n\n'What I'd like to see is -- we need to try to resolve the issues of immigration. This is the moment to be able to resolve things like border security and e-verify,' added Lankford.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch echoed Lankford's concerns, saying he was 'tired' of the immigration problem facing the country.\n\n'We have millions of great young people that can add a great deal to our country,' Hatch said. 'We need a permanent solution to this problem not just kicking it down the road.'\n\nHe added, 'We need to develop a solution that will recognize the positive contributions that Dreamers can make to our society.'\n\nThe new bill is the most recent piece of legislation drafted after the Trump administration's announcement officially rescinding the DACA program, effectively ending the Obama-era program that has deferred deportations for those who came to the United States as young immigrants.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security will no longer consider new applications for legal status and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it was rejecting all new DACA requests and employment authorization document (EAD) applications received after the Sept. 5 memo.\n\nThe Trump administration also allowed a six-month window for adjudication of the renewal process for DACA recipients, giving Congress to use as a period to craft a DACA fix.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-propose-new-daca-bill/","None"
"David Cassidy, Singer And 1970s TV Heartthrob, Dies At 67\nDavid Cassidy, Singer And 1970s TV Heartthrob, Dies At 67\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ellidge/Getty Images Ellidge/Getty Images\n\nOne of the biggest music and television stars of the 1970s has died: David Cassidy, who played the adolescent, aspiring musician on the TV show 'The Partridge Family' and who became a teen-dream pop idol in his own right, was 67 years old.\n\nCassidy revealed to People Magazine in February 2017 that he had been diagnosed with dementia and would stop performing. He also shared that both his grandfather and mother had suffered from dementia before him.\n\nCassidy was reported to be in critical condition on Nov. 19 with organ failure, and was hospitalized in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla. area. He died Tuesday night of liver failure.\n\nDavid Cassidy was born in 1950 in New York City to two performers, singer and actor Jack Cassidy and actress Evelyn Ward; his parents later divorced, and in 1956 his father wed another actress, Shirley Jones. Cassidy spent a large chunk of his childhood in suburban West Orange, N.J., being raised by his maternal grandparents, but eventually decided to follow in his parents' professional footsteps.\n\nStill a teenager, he ping-ponged between Los Angeles and New York before signing a contract with his father and Jones' manager. He went to California for a screen test in 1969; the camera loved Cassidy's glowing, preternaturally boyish good looks, and in short order he had booked episodes of several high-profile TV series, including Bonanza and Marcus Welby, M.D.\n\nWithin a year of his screen test, he had been signed to his life-changing role as the oldest child in a family of five aspiring pop singers and their musically gifted mother — played by Shirley Jones, Cassidy's real-life stepmother. By the time he was 20, Cassidy was one of the world's most recognizable television and music stars, even though he had never sung publicly until he became Keith Partridge.\n\n(The original idea was that all of the child actors would lip-sync the Partridge Family's musical numbers; shortly after the show went into production, the dusky-voiced Cassidy convinced the show's producers that he could hold his own vocally alongside Jones, who had already starred in film versions of musicals, including Oklahoma, Carousel and The Music Man.)\n\nYouTube\n\nWithin two months of the debut of The Partridge Family on ABC in September 1970, Cassidy had a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — 'I Think I Love You' — billed as 'The Partridge Family Starring Shirley Jones Featuring David Cassidy.'\n\nYouTube\n\nDuring an era when the Big Three broadcast networks still had a monolithic hold on pop culture, Cassidy's picture was suddenly everywhere — not just on the fronts of magazines and record albums, but on lunch boxes, posters, cereal boxes and toys. He sold out concert venues across the globe, from New York's Madison Square Garden to stadiums in London and Melbourne.\n\nBy 1972, Cassidy already was aching to shed his bubble-gum persona. Like legions of teenage stars before and after him, he played up his sex appeal to underscore his adulthood; in a cover story for Rolling Stone — with a portrait shot by Annie Leibovitz cropped just below the top of his pubic hair — he talked about his drug use: 'Not smack,' he explained, 'but grass and speed and psychedelics.'\n\nThe Partridge Family was canceled in 1974; Cassidy had some success as a solo musical act after that, but he felt as if he couldn't escape being Keith Partridge.\n\n'They're merchandising your name and your face and your likeness,' he told NPR in 1981. 'And I felt kind of robbed of my identity.'\n\nCassidy left acting for about three years while he tried to figure out what to do next. By the 1980s, he had started to appear in musical theater, both on Broadway and in London's West End.\n\nBut in his personal life, he eventually seemed to spin out entirely.

"Japan PM Shinzo Abe promises to handle North Korea threat\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Shinzo Abe called the snap election in September, and said the results were a 'vote of confidence'\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised strong 'counter-measures' against North Korea, after winning a decisive victory in Sunday's election.\n\nMr Abe had called an early election for a greater mandate to deal with 'crises', including the growing threat from Pyongyang, which has fired missiles over Japan in recent months.\n\nHis ruling coalition has retained a two-thirds majority in parliament.\n\nThis paves the way for Mr Abe to amend Japan's post-war pacifist constitution.\n\nThe prime minister has previously called for the existence of the country's armed forces to be formalised, a controversial move which he says is needed to strengthen Japan's defence but which critics say is a step towards re-militarisation.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Tokyo, Mr Abe said his coalition's win was a 'vote of confidence' from the public, and based on that 'we would dramatically show counter-measures against the North Korea threat'.\n\nHe said he would discuss these measures with US President Donald Trump, who is visiting Japan next month, as well as with other world powers such as Russia and China.\n\nHe said they would exert 'stronger pressure' on North Korea, adding: 'I will make sure the Japanese public is safe, and safeguard our nation.'\n\nMr Abe saw his popularity plummet in recent months while embroiled in political scandals, but enjoyed a sudden recovery after North Korea fired two missiles over the Japanese island of Hokkaido.\n\nThe BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says Mr Abe's pledge of tough diplomacy with North Korea is rhetoric that would play well with the Japanese public, but it is unclear what it means in concrete terms.\n\nTokyo has no diplomatic or economic relations with North Korea, and has poor relations with Pyongyang's closest ally China, so the most Mr Abe can do is strengthen Japan's defences and stick closely to the US, our correspondent adds.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Turnout on Sunday was estimated at about 53.7%\n\nMr Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) coalition with the Komeito party has won 313 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Japan's parliamentary Diet - which gives them the power to table a revision to the constitution.\n\nMr Abe had previously announced he wanted to revise a clause which renounces war, known as Article 9, to formally recognise Japan's military, which is known as the 'self-defence forces'.\n\nHe had set a deadline of 2020 to achieve this highly contentious task. But on Monday he appeared to ditch this target, saying it was 'not set in a concrete schedule'.\n\nHe said he hoped to 'form a strong agreement' on the issue among parties in parliament, and 'gain trust' from the Japanese public.\n\nEven if an amendment to the constitution is passed and approved by both houses in the Diet - which Mr Abe's coalition controls - it still needs to be put to a public vote in a referendum.\n\nMr Abe two years ago successfully managed to push for a re-interpretation of the constitution to allow troops to fight overseas under certain circumstances, which attracted widespread protests.\n\nOur correspondent says Mr Abe's victory is also in large part due to the chaos of Japan's opposition parties.\n\nIn the lead-up to the snap election, all eyes were on the recently-formed conservative Party of Hope led by the charismatic Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, with some speculating that it would make significant gains.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Ms Koike said she took responsibility for the result\n\nBut in the end it was overtaken by the centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party which emerged as the biggest opposition party, and which opposes Mr Abe's plan to amend Article 9.\n\nMs Koike, who was in Paris for a business trip during the election, told reporters she was personally taking responsibility for the result. Japanese media quoted her as saying her 'words and deeds' had caused 'displeasure' to voters.\n\nMr Abe's election win also raises his chances of securing a third three-year-term as leader of the LDP when the party votes next September.\n\nThat would give him the opportunity to become Japan's longest serving prime minister, having been elected in 2012.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41717219","None"

"Price protests turn political in Iran as rallies spread\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans in several cities across Iran on Friday, Iranian news agencies and social media reports said, as price protests turned into the largest wave of demonstrations since nationwide pro-reform unrest in 2009.\n\nPolice dispersed anti-government demonstrators in the western city of Kermanshah as protests spread to Tehran and several other cities a day after rallies in the northeast, the semi-official news agency Fars said.\n\nThe outbreak of unrest reflects growing discontent over rising prices and alleged corruption, as well as concern about the Islamic Republic’s costly involvement in regional conflicts such as those in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAn official said a few protesters had been arrested in Tehran, and footage posted on social media showed a heavy police presence in the capital and some other cities.\n\nWashington condemned the arrests. “The Iranian government should respect their people’s rights, including their right to express themselves,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. State Department in a separate statement urged “all nations to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption.”\n\nAbout 300 demonstrators gathered in Kermanshah after what Fars said was a “call by the anti-revolution.” They shouted: “Political prisoners should be freed” and “Freedom or death”, and some public property was destroyed. Fars did not name any opposition groups.\n\nThe protests in Kermanshah, the main city in a region where an earthquake killed over 600 people in November, took place a day after hundreds rallied in Iran’s second largest city Mashhad to protest at high prices and shout anti-government slogans.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed demonstrators yelling, “The people are begging, the clerics act like God.”\n\nFars said there were protests in the cities of Sari and Rasht in the north, Qazvin west of Tehran and Qom south of the capital, and also in Hamadan in western Iran. It said many marchers who wanted to raise economic demands left the rallies after demonstrators shouted political slogans.\n\nPRO-GOVERNMENT RALLIES PLANNED\n\nState television said annual nationwide rallies and events were scheduled for Saturday to commemorate pro-government demonstrations held in 2009 to counter protests by reformists.\n\nThe Revolutionary Guards, which along with its Basij militia spearheaded a crackdown against the protesters in 2009, said in a statement carried by state media that there were efforts to repeat that year’s unrest but added: “The Iranian nation ... will not allow the country to be hurt.”\n\nMohsen Nasj Hamadani, deputy security chief in Tehran province, said about 50 people had rallied in a square but most had left after being asked to by police, while a few who refused were “temporarily detained,” the ILNA news agency reported.\n\nIn the central city of Isfahan, a resident said protesters had joined a rally held by factory workers demanding back-pay.\n\n“The slogans quickly changed from the economy to those against (President Hassan) Rouhani and the Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei),” the resident said by telephone.\n\nIn Qom, a stronghold of the Shi’ite clergy, footage posted on social media showed protesters attacking Ayatollah Khamenei by name. “Seyyed Ali should be ashamed and leave the country alone,” they chanted.\n\nProtests were held also in the town of Quchan near the Turkmen border, and in Ahvaz, capital of oil-rich Khuzestan province, social media and Iranian news websites reported.\n\nPolice arrested 52 people in Thursday’s protests, Fars quoted a judicial official as saying in Mashhad, one of the holiest places in Shi’ite Islam.\n\nIn social media footage, which could not be authenticated, riot police were seen using water cannon and tear gas to disperse crowds.\n\nOpenly political protests are rare in Iran, where security services are omnipresent.\n\nThe last unrest of national significance occurred in 2009 when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s re-election as president ignited eight months of street protests. Pro-reform rivals said the vote was rigged.\n\nHowever, demonstrations are often held by workers over lay-offs or non-payment of salaries and by people who hold deposits in non-regulated, bankrupt financial institutions.\n\nProminent conservative cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda called earlier for tough action against the protests.\n\n“If the security and law enforcement agencies leave the rioters to themselves, enemies will publish films and pictures in their media and say that the Islamic Republic system has lost its revolutionary base in Mashhad,” the state news agency IRNA quoted Alamolhoda as saying.\n\n“DEATH TO DICTATOR”\n\nSome social media videos showed demonstrators chanting “Death to Rouhani” and “Death to the dictator”. Protests were also held in at least two other northeastern cities.\n\nAlamolhoda, the representative of Ayatollah Khamenei in Mashhad, said a few people had taken advantage of Thursday’s protests against rising prices to chant slogans against Iran’s role in regional conflicts.\n\nTehran backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country’s civil war, Shi’ite militias in Iraq, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group.\n\n“Some people had come to express their demands, but suddenly, in a crowd of hundreds, a small group that did not exceed 50 shouted deviant and horrendous slogans such as ‘Let go of Palestine’, ‘Not Gaza, not Lebanon, I’d give my life (only) for Iran’,” Alamolhoda said.\n\nSocial media videos also showed demonstrators chanting “Leave Syria, think about us,” criticizing Iran’s military and financial support for Assad.\n\nVice-President Eshaq Jahangiri, a close Rouhani ally, suggested that hardline conservative opponents of the pragmatist president might have triggered the protests but lost control of them. “Those who are behind such events will burn their own fingers,” IRNA quoted Jahangiri as saying.\n\nRouhani’s leading achievement, a 2015 deal with world powers that curbed Iran’s disputed nuclear program in return for a lifting of most international sanctions, has yet to bring the broad economic benefits the government says are coming.\n\nUnemployment stood at 12.4 percent in this fiscal year, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran, up 1.4 percent from the previous year. About 3.2 million Iranians are jobless, out of a total population of 80 million.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-economy-protests/price-protests-turn-political-in-iran-as-rallies-spread-idUSKBN1EN0P0","1514596515.0"

PAU BARRENA / AFP - Getty Images\n\nIn the region of Girona, Spanish officers scuffled with angry voters before smashing their way into a school being used as a polling station and seizing ballot boxes as voting began.\n\nArmed police also clashed with voters outside some polling centers in Barcelona.\n\nRubber bullets were fired at protesters in the center of the city, the Associated Press reported, with people showing minor wounds to TV cameras.\n\nThe poll has no legal status, as it has been blocked by Spain's Constitutional Court and Madrid for being at odds with the 1978 constitution, but tens of thousands of voters were still expected to take part.\n\nPuigdemont said Spain had used 'unjustified, irrational and irresponsible violence,' adding that it wouldn't stop Catalans voting 'peacefully and democratically.'\n\nHe said batons and rubber bullets had been used against people who were protecting ballot papers and polling stations.\n\n'Today Spain has lost even more that it had lost until now and the citizens of Catalonia we've achieved even more than we've had achieved till now,' he said.\n\nA man injured in clashes with Spanish armed police in Barcelona is escorted away by Catalan officers, Sunday.\n\nSpanish deputy prime minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said Madrid intervened with 'firmness and proportionality' against the Catalan vote, adding that the regional government had behaved with absolute irresponsibility in holding the referendum, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBut Juho Romakkaniemi, a senior European Union official, tweeted that while it was 'clear' the Spanish government was legally right about the Catalan referendum, 'excessive actions may endanger its legitimacy.'\n\nFC Barcelona — the city's top soccer club and a cultural symbol for the region — were due to play against Las Palmas — a team from Spain's Canary Islands off the coast of Africa — later on Sunday, but announced that they would play only behind closed doors with no crowd.\n\n'FC Barcelona condemns the events which have taken place in many parts of Catalonia today in order to prevent its citizens from exercising heir democratic right to free expression,' the club said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n\n'Given the exceptional nature of events, the Board of Directors have decided that the FC Barcelona first team game against Las Palmas will be played behind closed doors following the Professional Football League's refusal to postpone they game,' it added.\n\nThe club tweeted updates throughout the game.\n\nLas Palmas had earlier said in a statement that they would play wearing Spanish flags on their jerseys because 'we're against this referendum that no one has agreed to and we believe in the unity of Spain.'\n\nSpanish Guardia Civil guard smash the door of a polling station Catalonia's president was due to vote, early Sunday.

It also also posted video of officers carrying the boxes through crowds. 'The police, despite harassment, remove ballot boxes from the illegal referendum at the Jaume Balmes institute in Barcelona,' it said in a caption.\n\nCrowds gathered outside Ramon Llull school, in Barcelona's central Sagrada Familia district, to cast their vote early Sunday but riot police arrived and scaled a fence to stop the process. Around the corner at Els Llorers school, voting went ahead unhindered.\n\nIt was unclear why police were seemingly blocking voting at some schools but not others.\n\nShortly after 2 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) Turull said 96 percent of polling stations were still open. Many supporters of the vote spent the night in polling booths in a bid to keep them open.\n\nRelated: Catalan Independence Referendum: What's Behind Divisive Spanish Vote?\n\nHe called on the international community to recognize that Catalonia was witnessing 'human rights violations' and demanded the resignation of the Spanish government's representative in the region.\n\n'This violence is not proportional,' Turull added later at a press conference. He blamed Prime Minister Rajoy for the violence, saying it would never have happened had he allowed the vote to go ahead.\n\nMeanwhile Raul Romeva, Catalonia's foreign affairs minister, said they would be asking Europe to look into the crackdown.\n\nEarlier Sunday Puigdemont, the head of the regional government, urged Catalans to follow their convictions.

"Tom Petty, of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, dead at 66, manager says\nTom Petty, the rocker best known as the frontman of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, has died at the age of 66, his longtime manager said late Monday.\n\nTony Dimitriades said in a statement that Petty suffered cardiac arrest in his home in Malibu, California early Monday and was taken to UCLA Medical Center, but couldn't be revived. He died peacefully at 8:40 p.m. PT (Pacific Time) surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends, the statement continued.\n\nIt was also posted on Petty's Twitter page:\n\nPetty's daughter, AnnaKim Violette Petty, posted a tribute on Instagram:\n\nRIP💜 A post shared by Ilovemyfamily (@dadlivesmatteronelove) on Oct 2, 2017 at 9:10pm PDT\n\nPetty rose to fame in the 1970s with his band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The group put out several hits, including 'American Girl,' 'Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,' 'Breakdown,' 'Listen to Her Heart' and more. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Petty was also a successful solo artist and sang the megahit 'Freefallin'.'\n\nThough Petty and his band debuted their first self-titled record in 1976, they continued to perform over the past four decades. Petty played his last show last Monday, performing three sold-out shows at the Hollywood Bowl to conclude their 40th anniversary tour. The band wrote on their website that the tour included 53 shows in 24 states.\n\nIn December, Petty told Rolling Stone that he thought this would be the group's last tour together. He said, 'It's very likely we'll keep playing, but will we take on 50 shows in one tour? I don't think so. I'd be lying if I didn't say I was thinking this might be the last big one. We're all on the backside of our sixties. I have a granddaughter now I'd like to see as much as I can. I don't want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that's a lot of time.'\n\nPetty, who released three solo albums and 13 albums with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, also took part in the 1980s supergroup the Traveling Wilburys with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne. He told Rolling Stone he was hoping to release a deluxe version of his 1994 solo album 'Wildflowers' with a bonus disc of unreleased material. He had also hoped to play a special 'Wildflowers' tour.\n\nThe rocker kept his hands full with his SiriusXM channel, Tom Petty Radio, as well. He personally oversaw the station and had his own interview show called 'Tom Talks to Cool People' where he interviewed musicians like Micky Dolenz of the Monkees and former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham.\n\nPetty was born and raised in Gainesville, Florida. He said he wanted to become a musician when he was 13 and saw The Beatles play on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' He told Grammy.com, 'This was the great moment in my life, really, that changed everything. I had been a fan up to that point. But this was the thing that made me want to play music.' He added, 'It did have a great profound effect on my life, and I thank them for that. I still think the Beatles [made] the best music ever, and I'm sure I'll go to my grave thinking the same thing.'\n\nPetty showed the guitar he wrote 20 years of songs on to Anthony Mason on 'CBS This Morning' in 2009.

The United Nations, United Kingdom, Sweden and Bangladesh, among others, have denounced the arrests.\n\nThe journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, went missing on Tuesday after being invited to meet police officials over dinner on the northern outskirts of the city of Yangon. They had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, which has triggered the flight of more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh since late August.\n\nAs of Friday, Reuters had not been formally contacted by officials about the detention of the reporters. The Ministry of Information has said that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo “illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,” and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs.\n\nReuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the journalists, saying in a statement on Wednesday that the global news organization was “outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom.”\n\nA court official in the northern district of Yangon where they were detained said that no paperwork had been filed relating to either journalist. The official said that usually cases are lodged 20-30 days after an arrest as suspects can be held in custody for up to 28 days without being charged.\n\nOn Wednesday, Myanmar’s Ministry of Information said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, though officials have since disclosed that they have not been charged. The 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.\n\nPOSSIBLE U.S. SANCTIONS FOR ROHINGYA CRACKDOWN\n\nLast month, the United States called the Myanmar military operation against the Rohingya population “ethnic cleansing” and threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible for what it called “horrendous atrocities.”\n\nTillerson said at the United Nations on Friday that the United States had identified one individual as a sanctions target and was examining others over the campaign in Myanmar against minority Rohingya Muslims.\n\nMyanmar’s 2-year-old government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the Rohingya crisis, though it has no control over the generals with whom it shares power.\n\nRights monitors have accused Myanmar’s military of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson, against the stateless Rohingya during so-called clearance operations after Rohingya militants’ Aug. 25 attacks on 30 police posts and an army base.\n\nAmnesty International has called for a comprehensive arms embargo against Myanmar as well as targeted financial sanctions against senior Myanmar military officials.\n\nIn calling for release of the Reuters reporters on Friday, Tillerson said, “A free press is vital to Myanmar’s transition and becoming a viable democracy, and we want Myanmar’s democracy to succeed.”\n\nHe said the U.S. embassy in Myanmar was “expressing our concerns over the detention of individuals, demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.” The embassy said in a statement on its Facebook page on Friday, “We remain concerned about Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.”\n\n“Their families and others have not been allowed to see them, and don’t even know where they are being held.”\n\nReuters journalist Wa Lone, who is based in Myanmar, is seen in this undated picture taken in Myanmar. REUTERS/Stringer NO RESALES NO ARCHIVES\n\nWIDESPREAD DEMANDS FOR REPORTERS’ RELEASE\n\nTillerson’s comments came in the wake of a rising chorus of concern in the West over Myanmar’s action. The leaders of the U.S. Senate Human Rights Caucus, Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Chris Coons, said they were “gravely concerned” about the arrests.\n\nEarlier on Friday at the United Nations, British Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field said, “We will make it clear in the strongest possible terms that we feel that they need to be released at the earliest possible opportunity.”\n\nThe nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists also called for the reporters’ unconditional release, saying, “These arrests come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance.”\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the arrests were a “threat to a democratic and peaceful development of Myanmar and that region”.\n\n“We do not accept that journalists are attacked or simply kidnapped or that they disappear,” Wallstrom told reporters on Friday at the United Nations.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that the arrests were a signal that press freedom is shrinking in Myanmar and the international community must do all it can to get the reporters released.\n\nBritain has expressed “grave concerns” to the government of Myanmar over the arrest of the two journalists, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told reporters in London on Thursday.\n\n“We are committed to freedom of speech and people’s ability to report the facts and bring into the public domain what is happening in Rakhine state,” he said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBangladesh, which is struggling to cope with the influx of refugees into its southern tip, also condemned the arrests of reporters working for an agency that had shone a light for the world on the strife in Rakhine state.\n\n“We strongly denounce arrests of Reuters journalists and feel that those reporters be free immediately so that they can depict the truth to the world by their reporting,” said Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, information adviser to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nIn Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s spokesman Motosada Matano, said his government is closely watching the situation. He said Japan has been conducting a dialogue with the Myanmar government on human rights in Myanmar in general.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists/myanmar-faces-mounting-calls-for-release-of-reuters-journalists-idUSKBN1E91KA","1513382963.0"
"EU agrees clampdown on bitcoin platforms to tackle money laundering\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states and legislators agreed on Friday on stricter rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing on exchange platforms for bitcoin and other virtual currencies, the EU said in a statement.\n\nFILE PHOTO - European Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality Commissioner Vera Jourova attends an interview with Reuters at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, September 11, 2017. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nThe agreement is part of a broader set of measures to tackle financial crimes and tax evasion. EU legislators also backed stricter controls on pre-paid cards, and raised transparency requirements for the owners of trusts and companies.\n\n“Today’s agreement will bring more transparency to improve the prevention of money laundering and to cut off terrorist financing,” Europe’s Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said.\n\nThe EU decision comes as bitcoin’s prices have risen more than 1,700 percent since the start of the year, triggering worries that the market is a bubble that could burst in spectacular fashion.\n\nThe agreed measures will end anonymous transactions on virtual currency platforms and with pre-paid payment cards, which investigators said could have been used to fund attacks by militants.\n\nBitcoin exchange platforms and “wallet” providers that hold the cyber currency for clients will be required to identify their users, under the new rules which now must be formally adopted by EU states and European legislators and then turned into national laws within 18 months.\n\nIt took EU legislators more than a year of negotiations to agree on the legislative proposals, put forward by the European Commission in the wake of shooting and bombing attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016 which killed more than 160 people.\n\nThe talks dragged on because some EU states opposed increased transparency on trusts and companies, fearing a negative impact on their economies.\n\nThe EU lawmaker in charge of the issue, Dutch Green Judith Sargentini, said Britain, Malta, Cyprus, Luxembourg and Ireland were among those opposing the changes. The deal allows the authorities and “persons who can demonstrate a legitimate interest” to access data on the beneficial owners of trusts.\n\nTrusts are legitimate financial vehicles to manage assets but have sometimes been accused of hiding illegal activities because of their lack of transparency.\n\nTransparency International, a rights group, called the deal “a breakthrough” but lamented the fact that data on trusts’ owners will not be completely public, as it will be for beneficial owners of companies. The increased public scrutiny is considered essential by the EU commission and also by rights groups, to prevent financial crimes and tax evasion.\n\n(This version of the story corrects name of organisation in final paragraph to Transparency International, not Amnesty International.)","https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-moneylaundering/eu-agrees-clampdown-on-bitcoin-platforms-to-tackle-money-laundering-idUSKBN1E928M","1513364076.0"
"Saudi Arabia Orders Its Citizens Out of Lebanon, Raising Fears of War\n“There are so many fuses, so little communication, so many risks of something exploding, that there’s little chance of something not going wrong,” said Robert Malley, the former director of Middle East policy in the Obama White House and now vice president for policy at the International Crisis Group. “Everything needs to go right to maintain calm.”\n\nThe backdrop to the crisis was a series of steps by Saudi Arabia in recent days to confront its ascendant regional rival, Iran, and the surprise arrests of about 200 Saudis, including 11 princes, in what the government describes as an anti-corruption campaign but which critics see as a consolidation of power by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nLebanon had already been drawn into the crisis in two ways: After a rocket was fired from Yemen at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Saturday, Saudi officials accused Hezbollah and Iran of aiding in the attack. And they declared that the attack amounted to a declaration of war by Lebanon, a leap given that the weak Lebanese state does not control Hezbollah.\n\nAt the same time, the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, unexpectedly flew to Riyadh and declared his resignation there on Saturday. Suspicions were growing among officials and diplomats in Beirut on Thursday that he had not only been pressured to do so by Saudi Arabia but was being held there against his will.\n\nDespite the worries, analysts, officials and diplomats said that although they were not privy to the thinking of the Saudi crown prince, it was far-fetched that Saudi Arabia would launch a military action against Lebanon, since it is already overstretched in a war it started two years ago against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-lebanon-war.html","1510203600.0"

"Harvey expected to make landfall as a major hurricane\nHurricane Harvey is expected to hit Texas as a Category 3 storm — the likes of which hasn't been seen since 1999's Hurricane Bret — when it makes landfall late Friday or early Saturday, forecasters say.\n\nInterested in Hurricane Harvey? Add Hurricane Harvey as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Harvey news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe storm officially became a category 2 hurricane as of 1 a.m. on Friday with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, according to the National Weather Service, and was expected to continue to strengthen over the next 24 hours. The storm remained a category 2 hurricane throughout the early morning hours on Friday, reaching maximum sustained winds of 105 mph. Projections were for it to reach about 120 mph by the time it makes landfall. It was located about 180 miles southeast of Corpus Christi as of 5 a.m.\n\nLandfall is expected about 250 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, but hurricane warnings are in place from Brownsville to Houston. Tropical storm warnings extend inland to San Antonio.\n\nThe storm surge could be life threatening, up to 12 feet, with waves as high as 20 feet above that. Rain is expected to range from 10 to 20 inches, and some areas could receive up to 30 inches. Perilous flash flooding and 115 mph gusts are possible.\n\nFirst pass through the eye of #HurricaneHarvey in WP-3D Orion #NOAA42 Credit: LT Kevin Doremus/NOAA pic.twitter.com/iNBujp6wu6 — NOAAHurricaneHunters (@NOAA_HurrHunter) August 24, 2017\n\n'Harvey is expected to landfall around 1 a.m. Saturday, based on the current track,' ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin said, adding that more time over water could increase the storm's strength. 'If it had another day or two, it could be a higher category.'\n\nThe storm is being compared with not only Hurricane Bret but also the devastating Tropical Storm Allison, which in 2001 punished Houston with 40 inches of rain.\n\nThe biggest worry with Hurricane Harvey is that it's expected to stall over southeastern Texas, Griffin said.\n\n'When it does make landfall, it is expected to ... not move for several days, which is why we expect the rainfall to be the most devastating,' she said. 'Some spots could receive over 30 inches.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Thursday evening about storm preparation.\n\nSpoke with Pres. Trump & heads of Homeland Security & FEMA.

'Go to a family, friend and get to higher ground,' he said.\n\nHe left open the possibility of calling for mandatory evacuations, cautioning against trying to 'ride [the storm] out.'\n\n'I'm not going to risk our fire people and police people to risk themselves to get somebody out of the home,' he said. 'They got relatives, and they got family, and we don't want to put them in harm's way because someone wanted to stay in their home.'\n\nResidents there were emptying shelves at the local Sam's Club, where staples like batteries, generators and milk were in high demand Thursday.\n\n'We're out of bread, and we're out of water right now,' Sam's Club employee Julie Canales told ABC News. 'We've been stocked every day, but as soon as we get it, it's gone within an hour between truck [deliveries].'\n\nShe said topping locals' shopping lists is water. 'We do have trucks en route, but the line is already over 100 people,' she said.\n\nMany customers are stocking up on alcohol as well, she added. 'Beer and wine,' she said. 'It's something people are buying probably to calm everybody's nerves.'\n\nAt Coastal Hardware, kerosene lanterns, kerosene, sandbags and sand were out of stock.\n\nThe store's manager, Jennifer Wimsett, said customers have been buying up duct tape and have cleared out her stock of kits to make window shutters hurricane-proof.\n\nSince sand and sandbags are unavailable, she said, many people are improvising. 'They can fill up trash bags and fill them with topsoil if they don't have sand,' she said.\n\nMost of the flights in and out of Corpus Christi International Airport for Friday have been canceled, according to FlightAware.\n\nUnited Airlines will operate its last flight out of Corpus Christi at 7 a.m. Friday, and Southwest Airlines will operate its last flight at 10:40 a.m., the airport announced on Facebook.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz asked his Facebook followers to keep 'all those in the path of this storm in your thoughts and prayers.'\n\nHe urged Texans in the storm's predicted path to 'heed warnings from local officials, know your evacuation route and avoid all high-water areas' and not to underestimate Mother Nature.\n\n'This is a serious storm, with strong winds and what forecasters have predicted will potentially be a historic amount of rainfall that will significantly raise the risk of serious and life-threatening flooding,' Cruz said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott warned of 'severe flooding' and declared a state of disaster for 30 counties along the coastline.\n\nThe state announced mandatory evacuations for seven counties: Calhoun County, San Patricio County, Refugio County, Brazoria County, Jackson County, Victoria County and Matagorda County.\n\nLt. Craig Cummings of the Texas Department of Public Safety told ABC News that people need to take prepare for the worst.\n\n'The best thing that I tell my own family but I also tell professionally is to prepare,' he said, encouraging people to have a physical map on hand.\n\nIn neighboring Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards signed a statewide emergency declaration Thursday. Southwestern Louisiana could see up to 10 inches of rain from the storm.\n\nEdwards said that while plans to evacuate people are ready, 'hopefully we don't have to execute those plans.'\n\nABC News' Will Gretsky and Mark Osborne contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/harvey-expected-make-landfall-major-hurricane/story?id=49397270","None"
"Maersk says global IT breakdown caused by cyber attack\nCOPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one out of seven containers shipped globally, said the Petya cyber attack had caused outages at its computer systems across the world on Tuesday.\n\nThe Maersk ship Adrian Maersk is seen as it departs from New York Harbor in New York City, U.S., June 27, 2017.

The company handles around 25 percent of all containers shipped on the key Asia-Europe route.\n\nMaersk’s port operator APM Terminals was also hit, with Dutch broadcaster RTV Rijnmond reporting that 17 shipping container terminals run by APM Terminals had been hacked, including two in Rotterdam and 15 in other parts of the world.\n\nThe RTV report said computers were infected by ransomware that encrypted hard drives at APM Terminals.\n\nThe container shipping industry has lagged some other sectors in bringing more of its processes online.\n\nHowever, in a digital push Maersk says it is committed to automating its systems to drive efficiency and cut costs, although there is still a huge amount of paperwork slowing down the handling and tracking of containers.\n\nRussia’s top oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) said on Tuesday its servers had been hit by a large-scale cyber attack, but its oil production was unaffected.\n\nUkraine’s central bank also said a number of Ukrainian commercial banks and state and private companies had been hit by cyber attacks via an “unknown virus”.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-maersk-idUSKBN19I1NO","1498617438.0"
"US government demands details on all visitors to anti-Trump protest website\nThe US government is seeking to unmask every person who visited an anti-Trump website in what privacy advocates say is an unconstitutional “fishing expedition” for political dissidents.\n\nThe warrant appears to be an escalation of the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) campaign against anti-Trump activities, including the harsh prosecution of inauguration day protesters.\n\nOn 17 July, the DoJ served a website-hosting company, DreamHost, with a search warrant for every piece of information it possessed that was related to a website that was used to coordinate protests during Donald Trump’s inauguration. The warrant covers the people who own and operate the site, but also seeks to get the IP addresses of 1.3 million people who visited it, as well as the date and time of their visit and information about what browser or operating system they used.\n\nIn America, bias, hate and racism move from the margins to the mainstream | Al Sharpton Read more\n\nThe website, www.disruptj20.org, was used to coordinate protests and civil disobedience on 20 January, when Trump was inaugurated.\n\n“This specific case and this specific warrant are pure prosecutorial overreach by a highly politicized department of justice under [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions,” said Chris Ghazarian, general counsel for DreamHost. “You should be concerned that anyone should be targeted simply for visiting a website.”\n\nThe warrant was made public Monday, when DreamHost announced its plans to challenge the government in court. The DoJ declined to comment. A hearing is scheduled for Friday.\n\nThe government has aggressively prosecuted activists arrested during the 20 January protests in Washington DC. In April, the US attorney’s office in Washington DC filed a single indictment charging more than 217 people with identical crimes, including felony rioting.\n\nGhazarian said that DreamHost provided the government with “limited customer information about the owner of the website” when it first received a grand jury subpoena a week after the protests occurred. But the government came back in July with the much broader search warrant.\n\n“We’re a gatekeeper between the government and tens of thousands of people who visited the website,” said Ghazarian. “We want to keep them protected.”\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has been advising DreamHost, characterized the warrant as “unconstitutional” and “a fishing expedition”.\n\n“I can’t conceive of a legitimate justification other than casting your net as broadly as possible to justify millions of user logs,” senior staff attorney Mark Rumold told the Guardian.\n\nLogs of IP addresses don’t uniquely identify users, but they link back to specific physical addresses if no digital tools are used to mask it.\n\n“What they would be getting is a list of everyone who has ever been interested in attending these protests or seeing what was going on at the protests and that’s the troubling aspect. It’s a short step after you have the list to connect the IP address to someone’s identity,” he said.\n\nWide-reaching warrants for user data are sometimes issued when the content of a site is illegal such as pirated movies or child sexual abuse imagery, but speech is rarely prohibited.\n\n“This [the website] is pure first amendment advocacy – the type of advocacy the first amendment was designed to protect and promote,” Rumold added. “Frankly I’m glad DreamHost is pushing back on it.”\n\nIt’s not the first time that the US government has sought to unmask people protesting against Trump or his policies.\n\nPresident's first Trump Tower homecoming met with mass protest Read more\n\nIn March this year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a division of the homeland security department, ordered Twitter to hand over the phone number, mailing addresses and IP addresses associated with @ALT_USCIS, an account that purported to convey the views of dissenters within the government.\n\nThe account, whose username is a reference to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, is one of dozens of alternative Twitter accounts established after Trump was inaugurated. The unverified accounts claimed to provide an uncensored view of civil servants who disagreed with Trump’s policies.\n\nTo protect the identity of the person running the account, Twitter launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that it would have “a grave chilling effect on the speech of that account in particular and the many other ‘alternative agency’ accounts that have been created to voice dissent to government policies”.\n\nAfter public outcry over the administration’s overreach, CBP dropped the request.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-inauguration-protest-website-search-warrant-dreamhost","1502683200.0"
"Trump proves G20 is less than sum of its parts\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption International leaders failed to get Mr Trump to recommit to the Paris climate agreement\n\nWe'll get to the G20 in a moment. But let's start with organisational psychology. There are some groups or teams that are greater than the sum of their parts, and there are others - that for all the talent and power they may have individually - are less.\n\nThink soccer. Think last year's European Championship. Then tiny little Iceland were the heroes of the competition - and not just because of their wonderful fans.\n\nThis team of part-timers played way above their ranking, there was solidarity, singleness of purpose, real determination. And think of England. Absurdly well paid and pampered players, whose showcase is the Premier League, the wealthiest in the world - and they were just a bunch of inked and primped individuals who seemed to have no team spirit. Dire. Just dire.\n\nAnd so to the G20. It is not lousy like the England team were - I mean nothing could be as bad as that. But it is less than the sum of its parts.\n\nWhat of the joint communiqué (that will have been toiled over by bureaucratic draftsmen for days to find a bland enough form of words that all the leaders can sign up to) will be remembered in six months' time? What ringing declaration will change lives? What plan of action will we look back on and think 'turning point'?\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Police used water cannon to break up protests\n\nNo, I suspect this G20 will be remembered for two things.\n\nThe first, the appalling violence on the streets of Hamburg from a sizeable group of protestors who seemed hellbent on burning and looting (there was something surreal on Friday night, drinking a beer in the 20th floor bar of our hotel and watching the fires and the police on the street below - as if it was a rioting son et lumière spectacle put on for our entertainment).\n\nAnd second - the first meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump.\n\nI suspect if you asked Mr Trump what was most memorable for him, he too would say the Putin meeting - but also his day in Warsaw, when thousands of Poles chanted his name and 'U-S-A'. Remember the crowd does for him what a battery station does for a Tesla car.\n\nHis speech on the challenges facing the West was well crafted with an argument to make. And he just sounded - well - more committed to the idea of the 'West' than he did when he was last in Europe at the Nato summit and the G7.\n\nHis definition of what constitutes Western values may not have been to everyone's tastes - but he also committed the US to Article 5 of Nato, with its pledge that an attack on one is an attack against all. And for those countries who are part of the Alliance and abut Russia, they'll have been reassured by that.\n\nWhich brings us to the meeting with the Russian leader. I've read analysis since suggesting that it was a big victory for Trump; and some arguing that Mr Putin came out of top.\n\nBut that is to view the encounter as a zero sum game. Maybe both men emerged feeling they had won. Putin was treated seriously, wasn't lectured on human rights and democracy (his regular complaint about what it was like dealing with Barack Obama), and the meeting went on for nearly two hours more than its allotted time.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Was the first meeting between the two presidents a victory for Mr Putin or Mr Trump?\n\nWhy does that matter? Because the Russian leader will feel he was treated as an equal to the US president with major things to discuss. Mr Trump will feel he has put the 'Russia controversy' behind him. He raised it with Mr Putin, right, let's move on.\n\nBut that might be wishful thinking. Particularly after the Russians disclosed that the American president accepted the assurances of Mr Putin that Moscow hadn't interfered in last November's election.\n\nThe White House has not challenged that. And that leaves a very simple and astonishing point. Given the choice between accepting what his intelligence agencies have told him, and what Vladimir Putin has told him to be true, he's gone with the Russian.\n\nAnd that might not play well in Washington, where there are myriad inquiries going on into the Trump campaign's links to Russia - and a Republican Party, who by and large given the same choice over who to believe, will go for the nation's intelligence professionals. Donald J Trump might want a reset in the relationship with Russia, but there are political constraints on him in Washington.\n\nAnd then there are the decisions of the G20 itself. On two of the big ticket items - trade and climate change - it was really the G19 plus America. Mr Trump was intransigent in the face of appeals by other nations to recommit to the Paris climate change agreement. And there are real fears among European leaders that the president could unleash a trade war, over his insistence that America is being ripped off.\n\nSo if you're marking Mr Trump's card on how he got on, it really depends on where you stand on those issues. And as for the G20, it's hard to be more than the sum of its parts, when the biggest and most economically powerful member of the orchestra is humming a different tune.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40546617","None"
"Hackers compromised free CCleaner software, Avast's Piriform says\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hackers broke into British company Piriform Ltd’s free software that optimizes computer performance last month, potentially allowing them to control the devices of millions of users, the company and independent researchers said on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man holds a laptop computer as cyber code is projected on him in this illustration picture taken on May 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo\n\nMore than 2 million people downloaded tainted versions of Piriform’s program, which then directed the computers to get instructions from servers under the hacker’s control, Piriform said.\n\nPiriform said it worked with law enforcement and cut off communication to the servers before any malicious commands were detected. This came after security researchers at Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Morphisec Ltd alerted Piriform’s parent Avast Software of the hack last week.\n\nThe malicious program was slipped into legitimate software called CCleaner, which cleans up junk programs and advertising cookies to speed up devices.\n\nCCleaner is the main product made by London’s Piriform, which was bought in July by Prague-based Avast, one of the world’s largest computer security vendors. At the time of the acquisition, the company said 130 million people used CCleaner.\n\nA version of CCleaner downloaded in August and September included remote administration tools that tried to connect to several unregistered web pages, presumably to download additional unauthorized programs, security researchers at Cisco’s Talos unit said.\n\nTalos researcher Craig Williams said it was a sophisticated attack because it penetrated an established and trusted supplier in a manner similar to June’s “NotPetya” attack on companies that downloaded infected Ukrainian accounting software.\n\n“There is nothing a user could have noticed,” Williams said, noting that the optimization software had a proper digital certificate, which means that other computers automatically trust the program.\n\nIn a blog post, Piriform confirmed that two programs released in August were compromised. It advised users of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 to download new versions. A spokeswoman said that 2.27 million users had downloaded the August version of CCleaner while only 5,000 users had installed the compromised version of CCleaner Cloud.\n\nPiriform said that Avast, its new parent company, had uncovered the attacks on Sept. 12. A new, uncompromised version of CCleaner was released the same day and a clean version of CCleaner Cloud was released on Sept. 15, it said.\n\nOnly the cloud version could be updated automatically to remove the bad code.\n\nThe nature of the attack code suggests that the hacker won access to a machine used to create CCleaner, Williams said.\n\nCCleaner does not update automatically, so those who installed the problematic version will need to delete it and install a fresh version, he said.\n\nHe also recommended running an antivirus scan.\n\nWilliams said that Talos detected the issue at an early stage, when the hackers appeared to be collecting information from infected machines, rather than forcing them to install new programs.\n\nPiriform said in a news release that it had worked with U.S. law enforcement to shut down a server located in the United States to which traffic was set to be directed.\n\nIt said the server was closed down on Sept. 15 “before any known harm was done.”\n\nAvast said little about the breach, posting nothing on its Twitter account in the 12 hours after the announcement and displaying nothing on its main web page.\n\nPiriform’s news release and technical blog post did not mention Cisco or its partner Morphisec, instead crediting Avast with discovering the still-unexplained compromise.\n\nAfter the controlling web addresses were seized, Cisco saw 200,000 attempts to connect to them.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-security-avast/hackers-compromised-free-ccleaner-software-avasts-piriform-says-idUSKCN1BT0R9","1505769332.0"
"France's Emmanuel Macron: Birth of the anti-Trump?\nImage copyright AFP\n\nEmmanuel Macron has just won the rare distinction of being the most re-tweeted French person in history.\n\nIn less than 24 hours, his Trump-defying message 'make our planet great again' was shared more than 140,000 times, easily ousting the previous record-holder, the rather less high-minded TV presenter Cyril Hanouna. One fifth of the re-tweets were in the US.\n\nIt is proof yet again that what we witnessed from the Elysee on Thursday was a master class in communications.\n\nA growing fan club\n\nIn giving his TV reaction to the US president, not only did Macron break brazenly with longstanding convention, according to which French presidents never speak publicly in English, but he even had the chutzpah to subvert the US leader's personal campaign slogan.\n\n'Make our planet great again' was a provocation dressed up as a call to virtue. As a catchphrase for the faithful, it was irresistible.\n\nBy tweeting it, Macron took one more step down his road to investiture as that long-awaited international figure: the anti-Trump.\n\nThe French leader has a growing fan club: in France, the US and across the globe, among people who see him as the polar opposite, the perfect antithesis of his counterpart in the White House.\n\nThese people love the fact that with the arrival of Macron, the existing order appears to have been turned on its head.\n\nIt used to be France that was old, inward-looking and incapable of regeneration, and America that was the land of youth, energy and leadership.\n\nBut where is that caricature now?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump's handshakes with world leaders, including President Macron, have been closely watched\n\nAnd they adore the way that Macron had the nerve to face down Trump in the Brussels handshake. At last, they feel, we have a champion with the guts and the conviction to challenge the Trumpian order.\n\nMacron himself never planned any of this. When he first thought of running for the presidency, the chances of a Trump in the White House seemed too ludicrous to contemplate.\n\nBut not for the first time, the stars seem to have aligned for France's boy-prodigy.\n\nJust as in domestic politics doors seemed to open miraculously for President Macron, so in the world of international affairs shifts of power and ideology are also working in his favour - for now.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption French President Emmanuel Macron says Paris agreement will 'make the planet great again'\n\nThe tilt towards nationalist interests exemplified by Trump's America has created a clear leadership space for someone who will fly the other flag. Providential or not, Macron has come to power just as a reaction sets in against the populist tide of the last few years - and he is poised to reap the reward.\n\nWith its perpetual harping on about ideals and morals, France's capacity to irritate is prodigious. Perhaps it will not be long before Macron loses his touch and the world starts panting for his comeuppance.\n\nBut right now, with Trump in the White House, French preachiness doesn't appear to raise as many heckles as it used to. Having a quotable charmer for a president certainly helps.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40140113","None"
"‘Thank God you missed one’: Bodycam records cop mistakenly shooting photographer he knows\nThere was a clear rapport between the police officer and the man he shot Monday night on a dark Ohio street.\n\nNewly released footage from Clark County Sheriff’s Deputy Jake Shaw’s body camera shows him drawing his service weapon during a traffic stop and firing two shots at what he thought was an approaching, gun-wielding assailant. One round struck the man in the abdomen; the other buzzed past.\n\nBut the man was not an attacker. It was Andy Grimm, a photographer with the local newspaper, the New Carlisle News. Shaw realized his mistake as he ran toward Grimm, who was screaming on the ground.\n\nThe video captures few clear images of the encounter as Shaw maneuvered to put pressure on Grimm’s gunshot wound. The audio, however, remains crystal clear.\n\n[The Washington Post’s police shooting database]\n\n“Andy, I thought it was a friggin’ gun, dude,” Shaw says. “Stay strong with me. I love you, brother,” he pleads.\n\nThrough the commotion, Grimm explains he was in the area to photograph lightning storms sparking across the sky, and stopped to photograph the traffic stop.\n\n“Ah, I’m missing the lightning for it, too,” Grimm says as lightning crashes overhead, utilizing an expletive to express his frustration.\n\n“I need you to call my wife,” Grimm says repeatedly. “I thought you saw me wave, dude.”\n\nIt was unclear from the video how the men knew each other, though it is not uncommon for local journalists to become acquainted with first responders. Andy Grimm has been working at the paper for years, said his father Dale Grimm, who received a phone call from his son from the ambulance.\n\n“He said he got out, parked under a light in plain view of the deputy, with a press pass around his neck,” Dale Grimm told The Washington Post. “He was setting up his camera, and he heard pops.” Dale Grimm and his son run the family-owned newspaper, located in New Carlisle, a town just outside Dayton, Ohio.\n\n“We know the deputy. This is a small town of 5,000 people…. We know the deputies. We work with them on a daily basis. We have an excellent relationship with them,” the elder Grimm said.\n\nAndy Grimm tells Shaw, “I don’t want you to lose your job for this” in between streams of expletives in the video.\n\n[After Minneapolis police officer fatally shoots Australian woman, her relatives plead for answers]\n\nClark County Sheriff Deborah Burchett did not respond to an email requesting comment. In a brief statement Tuesday, the sheriff’s office said Shaw has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\n“Our hearts and prayers are with Mr. Grimm as he recovers and with Deputy Jake Shaw and we ask the community to keep both of them in your hearts and prayers as well,” the statement said.\n\nThe sheriff’s office referred all further questions to the state attorney general’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which is looking into the shooting.\n\nState investigators, however, have remained tight-lipped.\n\n“We’re still investigating to determine what exactly occurred,” said Jill Del Greco, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office.\n\nParamedics arrived about five minutes after the shooting, according to the video. Grimm tells Shaw and others his camera is his “livelihood” and asks for it to be secured on his way to the emergency room.\n\nHe also didn’t lose his sense of humor.\n\nIn the video, Shaw tells one first responder that he fired two shots at Grimm.\n\n“Thank God you missed one,” Grimm replies.\n\nThis story, originally published on Sept. 5, has been updated.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nPolice shot and killed a man while trying to serve a warrant — at the wrong house\n\nMan accused of fatally shooting a Missouri police officer during a traffic stop has been arrested\n\nParolee’s anger at police may have led to shooting","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/05/officer-shoots-ohio-newspaper-photographer-after-confusing-his-tripod-and-camera-for-a-gun/","1504584000.0"
"Pentagon Announces First-Ever Audit Of The Department Of Defense\nPentagon Announces First-Ever Audit Of The Department Of Defense\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images\n\n'The Defense Department is starting the first agency-wide financial audit in its history,' the Pentagon's news service says, announcing that it's undertaking an immense task that has been sought, promised and delayed for years.\n\nOf the tally that is starting this week, chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana W. White said, 'It demonstrates our commitment to fiscal responsibility and maximizing the value of every taxpayer dollar that is entrusted to us.'\n\n'Beginning in 2018, our audits will occur annually, with reports issued Nov. 15,' the Defense Department's comptroller, David L. Norquist, said.\n\nThe Defense Department has famously never been audited, despite receiving hundreds of billions of dollars annually and having more than $2.2 trillion in assets.\n\nFor the Pentagon to get to this point, it has been, as they say, a process. The U.S. government established requirements for each agency to present financial statements back in the 1990s. But for more than 20 years, the Department of Defense has lagged other agencies that were following modern accounting standards, reporting what they received and spent.\n\nIn 2010, Congress included a requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act that gave the military 'an extra seven years to clean up the books and get ready,' as Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa said last year. That set a new deadline to be ready for an audit by September 2017.\n\nIn late 2016, reports emerged that Pentagon officials had 'buried an internal study that exposed $125 billion in administrative waste in its business operations amid fears Congress would use the findings as an excuse to slash the defense budget, as The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn January, the Government Accountability Office said, 'serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense (DOD) that have prevented its financial statements from being auditable.' The agency listed the Defense Department as its prime example of major impediments to attempts to render an opinion on the U.S. government's financial statements.\n\nTo carry out the audit, the Pentagon says it will deploy 2,400 auditors to go over records and examine bases, property and weapons of a federal department that had a budget of $590 billion last year.\n\nAs for how the audit would work, Jim Garamone of the official DoD News agency reports that the department's Office of the Inspector General has 'hired independent public accounting firms to conduct audits of individual components — the Army, Navy, Air Force, agencies, activities and more — as well as a departmentwide consolidated audit to summarize all results and conclusions.'\n\nThe Defense Department's lack of a financial reckoning hasn't hurt its funding. Last month, Congress approved nearly $700 billion for the department — some $100 billion more than last year's budget and billions more than the $639.1 billion that had been initially requested by President Trump.\n\nThe Pentagon audit would deliver on a campaign pledge by Trump. He was one of several candidates, including Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, to make that promise — perhaps in the knowledge that the audit had already been federally mandated.\n\nAfter taking office, Trump later nominated Norquist, a former Department of the Army employee whose experience includes stints on the staff of the House Appropriations Committee and as the chief financial officer of the Department of Homeland Security, as the Pentagon's comptroller.\n\nThis summer, Norquist was asked by Defense News if the looming audit was 'the biggest bugaboo of the job.'\n\nNorquist replied, 'I don't think of it as a bugaboo. I think of it as a great opportunity.'\n\nAn audit would allow his office to find errors more easily, Norquist said, and to analyze the Pentagon's data to look for patterns and trends that could help make it more efficient.\n\n'It is important that the Congress and the American people have confidence in DoD's management of every taxpayer dollar,' Norquist said this week.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/08/569394885/pentagon-announces-first-ever-audit-of-the-department-of-defense","1512709200.0"
"The time when America stopped being great\nA year ago Donald Trump produced the biggest political upset in modern-day America, but were there historical clues that pointed to his unexpected victory?\n\nFlying into Los Angeles, a descent that takes you from the desert, over the mountains, to the outer suburbs dotted with swimming pools shaped like kidneys, always brings on a near narcotic surge of nostalgia.\n\nThis was the flight path I followed more than 30 years ago, as I fulfilled a boyhood dream to make my first trip to the United States. America had always fired my imagination, both as a place and as an idea. So as I entered the immigration hall, under the winsome smile of America's movie star president, it was hardly a case of love at first sight.\n\nMy infatuation had started long before, with Westerns, cop shows, superhero comic strips, and movies such as West Side Story and Grease. Gotham exerted more of a pull than London. My 16-year-old self could quote more presidents than prime ministers. Like so many new arrivals, like so many of my compatriots, I felt an instant sense of belonging, a fealty borne of familiarity.\n\nEighties America lived up to its billing, from the multi-lane freeways to the cavernous fridges, from the drive-in movie theatres to the drive-through burger joints. I loved the bigness, the boldness, the brashness. Coming from a country where too many people were reconciled to their fate from too early an age, the animating force of the American Dream was not just seductive but unshackling.\n\nUpward mobility was not a given amongst my schoolmates. The absence of resentment was also striking: the belief success was something to emulate rather than envy. The sight of a Cadillac induced different feelings than the sight of a Rolls Royce.\n\nIt was 1984. Los Angeles was hosting the Olympics. The Soviet boycott meant US athletes dominated the medals table more so than usual. McDonald's had a scratch-card promotion, planned presumably before Eastern bloc countries decided to keep their distance, offering Big Macs, Cokes and fries if Americans won gold, silver or bronze in selected events. So for weeks I feasted on free fast food, a calorific accompaniment to chants of 'USA! USA!'\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThis was the summertime of American resurgence. After the long national nightmare of Vietnam, Watergate and the Iranian hostage crisis, the country demonstrated its capacity for renewal. 1984, far from being the dystopian hell presaged by George Orwell, was a time of celebration and optimism. Uncle Sam - back then, nobody gave much thought to the country being given a male personification - seemed happy again in his own skin.\n\nFor millions, it really was 'Morning Again in America', the slogan of Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign. In that year's presidential election, he buried his Democratic opponent Walter Mondale in a landslide, winning 49 out of 50 states and 58.8% of the popular vote.\n\nThe United States could hardly be described as politically harmonious. There was the usual divided government. Republicans retained control of the Senate, but the Democrats kept their stranglehold on the House of Representatives. Reagan's sunniness was sullied by the launch of his 1980 campaign with a call for 'states' rights', which sounded to many like a dog-whistle for denial of civil rights.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ronald Reagan on the campaign trail in 1979\n\nHis chosen venue was Philadelphia, but not the city of brotherly love, the cradle of the Declaration of Independence, but rather Philadelphia, Mississippi, a rural backwater close to where three civil rights workers had been murdered by white supremacists in 1964. Reagan, like Nixon, pursued the southern strategy, which exploited white fears about black advance.\n\nStill, the anthem of the hour was Lee Greenwood's God Bless the USA and politics was not nearly as polarised as it is today. Even though the Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill reviled Reagan's trickle-down economics - he called him a 'cheerleader for selfishness' and 'Herbert Hoover with a smile' - these two Irish-Americans found common ground as they sought to act in the national interest.\n\nBoth understood the Founding Fathers had hard-wired compromise into the governmental system, and that Washington, with its checks and balances, was unworkable without give and take. They worked together on tax reform and safeguarding Social Security.\n\nThe country was in the ascendant. Not so paranoid as it was in the 1950s, not so restive as it was in the 1960s, and nowhere near as demoralised as it had been in the 1970s.\n\nHistory is never neat or linear. Decades do not automatically have personalities, but it is possible to divide the period since 1984 into two distinct phases. The final 16 years of the 20th Century was a time of American hegemony. The first 16 years of the 21st Century has proven to be a period of dysfunction, discontent, disillusionment and decline. The America of today in many ways reflects the dissonance between the two.\n\nDominance\n\nIn those twilight years of the last millennium, America enjoyed something akin to the dominance achieved at the Los Angeles Olympics. Just two years after Reagan demanded that Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall, that concrete and ideological barricade was gone. The United States won the Cold War. In the New World Order that emerged afterwards, it became the sole superpower in a unipolar world.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A Berliner celebrates in front of the Berlin wall on 15 November 1989\n\nThe speed at which US-led forces won the first Gulf War in 1991 helped slay the ghosts of Vietnam. With a reformist leader, Boris Yeltsin, installed in the Kremlin, there was an expectation Russia would embrace democratic reform. Even after Tiananmen Square, there was a hope that China might follow suit, as it moved towards a more market-based economy.\n\nThis was the thrust of Francis Fukuyama's thesis in his landmark 1989 essay, The End of History, which spoke of 'the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government'.\n\nFor all the forecasts Japan would become the world's largest economy, America refused to cede its financial and commercial dominance. Instead of Sony ruling the corporate world, Silicon Valley became the new high-tech workshop of business.\n\nBill Clinton's boast of building a bridge to the 21st Century rang true, although it was emergent tech giants such as Microsoft, Apple and Google that were the true architects and engineers. Thirty years after planting the Stars and Stripes on the Sea of Tranquillity, America not only dominated outer space but cyberspace too.\n\nThis phase of US dominance could never be described as untroubled. The Los Angeles riots in 1992, sparked by the beating of Rodney King and the acquittal of the police officers charged with his assault, highlighted deep racial divisions.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Police officer acquittals fuelled the Los Angeles riots in 1992\n\nIn Washington, Bill Clinton's impeachment exhibited the hyper-partisanship that was changing the tenor of Washington life. In the age of 24/7 cable news, politics was starting to double as soap opera.\n\nYet as we approached 31 December 1999, the assertion that the 20th Century had been The American Century was an axiom. I was in the capital as Bill Clinton presided over the midnight celebrations on the National Mall, and as the fireworks skipped from the Lincoln Memorial down the Reflecting Pool to illuminate the Washington monument, the mighty obelisk looked like a giant exclamation mark or a massive number one.\n\nShattered confidence\n\nThe national story changed dramatically and unexpectedly soon after. While doomsday predictions of a Y2K bug failed to materialise, it nonetheless felt as if the United States had been infected with a virus. 2000 saw the dot-com bubble explode. In November, the disputed presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore badly damaged the reputation of US democracy.\n\nWhy, a Zimbabwean diplomat even suggested Africa send international observers to oversee the Florida recount. Beyond America's borders came harbingers of trouble. In Russia, 31 December 1999, as those fireworks were being primed, Vladimir Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe year 2001 brought the horror of September 11th, an event more traumatic than Pearl Harbor. Post-9/11 America became less welcoming and more suspicious. The Bush administration's 'war on terror' - open-ended conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq - drained the country of blood and treasure.\n\nThe collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and the Great Recession that followed, arguably had a more lasting impact on the American psyche than the destruction of the Twin Towers. Just as 9/11 had undermined confidence in the country's national security, the financial collapse shattered confidence in its economic security.\n\nWith parents no longer certain their children would come to enjoy more abundant lives than they did, the American Dream felt like a chimera. The American compact, the bargain that if you worked hard and played by the rules your family would succeed, was no longer assumed. Between 2000 and 2011, the overall net wealth of US households fell. By 2014, the richest 1% of Americans had accrued more wealth than the bottom 90%.\n\nTo many in the watching world, and most of the 69 million Americans who voted for him, the election of the country's first black president again demonstrated America's capacity for regeneration.\n\n'Yes we can.'\n\n'The audacity of hope'.\n\nBarack Hussein Obama. His improbable success story seemed uniquely American.\n\nAlthough his presidency did much to rescue the economy, he couldn't repair a fractured country. The creation of a post-partisan nation, which Obama outlined in his breakthrough speech at the 2004 Democratic convention, proved just as illusory as the emergence of a post-racial society, which he always knew was beyond him.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Obama in October 2008\n\nDuring the Obama years, Washington descended into a level of dysfunction unprecedented in post-war America.\n\n'My number one priority is making sure President Obama's a one-term president,' declared then-Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell, summing up the obstructionist mood of his Republican colleagues. It led to a crisis of governance, including the shutdown of 2013 and the repeated battles over raising the debt ceiling. The political map of America, rather than taking on a more purple hue, came to be rendered in deeper shades of red and blue.\n\nBeyond Capitol Hill, there was a whitelash to the first black president, seen in the rise of the Birther movement and in elements of the Tea Party movement. On the right, movement conservatives challenged establishment Republicans. On the left, identity politics displaced a more class-oriented politics as union influence waned. Both parties seemed to vacate the middle ground, relying instead on maximising support from their respective bases - African-Americans, evangelicals, the LGBT community, gun-owners - to win elections.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Barack Obama continued to talk about moving towards a more perfect union. But reality made a mockery of these lofty words. Sandy Hook. Orlando. The spate of police shootings. The gang-related mayhem in his adopted home of Chicago. The mess in Washington. The opioid crisis. The health indices even pointed to a sick nation, in which the death rate was rising. By 2016, life expectancy fell for the first time since 1993.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US election: Relive the wild ride in 170 seconds\n\nThis was the backdrop against which the 2016 election was fought, one of the most dispiriting campaigns in US political history. A battle between the two most unpopular major party candidates since polling began, ended with a victor who had higher negative ratings than his opponent and in the end, three million fewer votes.\n\nJust as I had been on the National Mall to ring in the new millennium in 2000, I was there again on 20 January 2017, for Donald Trump's inaugural celebrations. They included some Reagan-era flourishes. At the eve of the inauguration concert, Lee Greenwood reprised his Reaganite anthem God Bless the USA, albeit with a frailer voice.\n\nThere were chants of 'USA, USA,' a staple of the billionaire's campaign rallies - usually triggered by his riff on building a wall along the Mexican border. There was also an 80s vibe about the telegenic first family, who looked fresh from a set of a primetime soap, like Dynasty or Falcon Crest.\n\nThe spectacle brought to mind what Norman Mailer once said of Reagan, that the 40th president understood 'the President of the United States was the leading soap opera figure in the great American drama, and one had better possess star value'. Trump understood this, and it explained much of his success, even if his star power came from reality TV rather than Hollywood B-movies.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Michael Cockerell: The parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump\n\nYet Trump is not Reagan. His politics of grievance, and the fist-shaking anger it fed off, struck a different tone than the Gipper's more positive pitch. It played on a shared sense of personal and national victimhood that would have been alien to Reagan.\n\nIn the space of just three decades, then, the United States had gone from 'It's morning in America again' to something much darker: 'American Carnage', the most memorable phrase from Trump's inaugural address.\n\nA hangover\n\nIt is tempting to see Trump's victory this time last year as an aberration. A historical mishap. The election all came down, after all, to just 77,744 votes in three key states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. But when you consider the boom-to-bust cycle of the period between 1984 and 2016, the Trump phenomenon doesn't look so accidental.\n\nIn many ways Trump's unexpected victory marked the culmination of a large number of trends in US politics, society and culture, many of which are rooted in that end-of-century period of American dominion.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nConsider how the fall of the Berlin Wall changed Washington, and how it ushered in an era of destructive and negative politics. In the post-war years, bipartisanship was routine, partly because of a shared determination to defeat communism. America's two-party system, adversarial though it was, benefited from the existence of a shared enemy. To pass laws, President Eisenhower regularly worked with Democratic chieftains such as House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson.\n\nReforms such as the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which improved science teaching in response to the launch of Sputnik, were framed precisely with defeating communism in mind.\n\nMuch of the impetus to pass landmark civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s came from the propaganda gift Jim Crow laws handed to the Soviet Union, especially as Moscow sought to expand its sphere of influence among newly decolonised African nations.\n\nPatriotic bipartisanship frayed and ripped after the end of the Cold War. It was in the 1990s the then-Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole started to use the filibuster more aggressively as a blocking device. Government shutdowns became politically weaponised.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn the 1994 congressional mid-terms, the Republican revolution brought a wave of fierce partisans to Washington, with an ideological aversion to government and thus little investment in making it work. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the first Republican to occupy the post in 40 years, personified the kind of abrasive partisan that came to the fore on Capitol Hill.\n\nGrudging bipartisanship was still possible, as Clinton and Gingrich demonstrated over welfare and criminal justice reform in the mid-1990s. But this period witnessed the acidification of DC politics. The gerrymandering of the House of Representatives encouraged strict partisanship, because the threat to most lawmakers came from within their own parties. Moderates or pragmatists who strayed from the partisan path were punished with a primary challenge from more doctrinaire rivals.\n\nBy the 112th Congress in 2011-2012, there was no Democrat in the House more conservative than a Republican and no Republican more liberal than a Democrat. This was new. In the post-war years, there had been considerable ideological overlap between liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats. In this more polarised climate, bipartisanship became a dirty word. One leading conservative thinker and anti-tax campaigner, Grover Norquist, likened it to date rape.\n\nWould Congress have impeached Bill Clinton, ostensibly for having an affair with an intern, had America still been waging the Cold War? I sense not - it would have been seen, in those more serious times, as a frivolous distraction. When Congress moved towards impeaching Richard Nixon it did so because Watergate and its cover-up truly rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanours.\n\nClinton's impeachment signalled the emergence of another new political trend: the delegitimisation of sitting presidents. And both parties played the game. The Democrats cast George W Bush as illegitimate because Al Gore won the popular vote and the Supreme Court controversially ruled in the Republican's favour during the Florida recount.\n\nThe Birther movement, led by Donald Trump, tried to delegitimise Barack Obama with specious and racist claims that he was not born in Hawaii. Most recently, the Democrats have cast aspersions on Trump's victory, partly because he lost the popular vote and partly because they allege he achieved a Kremlin-assisted victory.\n\nOver this period, the political discourse also became shriller. Rush Limbaugh, after getting his first radio show in 1984, rose to become the king of the right-wing shock jocks. Fox News was launched in 1996, the same year as MSNBC, which became its progressive counterpoint. The internet quickened the metabolism of the news industry and became the home for the kind of hateful commentary traditional news outlets rarely published.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Home foreclosures skyrocketed at the end of the last decade\n\nMaybe the Jerry Springerisation of political news coverage can be traced to the moment the Drudge Report first published the name Monica Lewinsky, 'scooping' Newsweek which hesitated before publishing such an explosive story. The success of the Drudge Report demonstrated how new outlets, which didn't share the same news values as the mainstream media, could establish brands literally overnight. This lesson was doubtless learnt by Andrew Breitbart, an editor at Drudge who founded the right-wing website Breitbart News.\n\nThe internet and social media, trumpeted initially as the ultimate tool for bringing people together, actually became a forum for cynicism, division and various outlandish conspiracy theories. America became more atomised.\n\nAs Robert D Putnam identified in his 1995 seminal essay, Bowling Alone, lower participation rates in organisations such as unions, parent teacher associations, the Boy Scouts and women's clubs had reduced person to person contacts and civil interaction.\n\nEconomically, this period saw the continuation of what's been called the 'Great Divergence' which produced stark inequalities in wealth and income. Between 1979 and 2007, household income in the top 1% grew by 275% compared to just 18% growth in the bottom fifth of households.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The heroin-ravaged city fighting back\n\nThe Clinton-era was a period of financial deregulation, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, the landmark reform passed during the depression, as well as legislation exempting credit default swaps from regulation.\n\nDisruptive technologies changed the workplace and upended the labour market. Automation, more so than globalisation, was the big jobs killer during this phase. Between 1990 and 2007, machines killed off up to 670,000 US manufacturing jobs alone.\n\nThe Rust Belt rebellion that propelled Trump to the White House has been described as a revolt against robots, not that his supporters viewed it that way. Encouraged by the billionaire, many blamed increased foreign competition and the influx of foreign workers.\n\nThe opioid crisis can be traced back to the early 1990s with the over-prescription of powerful painkillers. Between 1991 and 2011, painkiller prescriptions tripled.\n\nAmerica seemed intoxicated by its own post-Cold War success. Then came the hangover of the past 16 years.\n\nTrump's America\n\nOver the past few months, I've followed that same westward flight path to California on a number of occasions, and found myself asking what would an impressionable 16-year-old make of America now. Would she share my adolescent sense of wonder, or would she peer out over the Pacific at twilight and wonder if the sun was setting on America itself?\n\nWhat would she make of the gun violence, brought into grotesque relief again by the Las Vegas massacre? Multiple shootings are not new, of course. Just days before I arrived in the States in 1984, a gunman had walked into a McDonalds in a suburb of San Diego and shot dead 21 people. It was then the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.\n\nWhat's different between now and then, however, is the regularity of these massacres, and how the repetitiveness of the killings has normalised them. What was striking about Las Vegas was the muted nationwide response to a gunman killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mourners at a vigil for Las Vegas shooting victims\n\nOnce-shocking massacres no longer arouse intense emotions for those unconnected to the killings. A month on, and it is almost as if it didn't happen.\n\nWhat would she make of race relations? Back in 1984, black athletes such as Carl Lewis, Edwin Moses and Michael Jordan were unifying figures as they helped reap that Olympic golden harvest. Now some of America's leading black athletes are vilified by their president for taking a knee to protest, a right enshrined in the First Amendment. These athletes now find themselves combatants in the country's endless culture wars.\n\nWhat would she make of the confluence of gun violence and race, evident in the spate of police shootings of unarmed black men and in the online auction where the weapon that killed Trayvon Martin fetched more than $100,000?\n\nCharlottesville, with its torch-wielding and hate-spewing neo-Nazis, was another low point. So, too, were the president's remarks afterwards, when he described the crowd as including some 'very fine people' and implied a moral equivalence between white supremacists and anti-racist protesters.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter\n\nI was at the news conference in Trump Tower that day. An African-American cameraman next to me yelled out 'What message does this send to our children?' The question went unanswered, but concerned parents ask it everyday about Donald Trump's behaviour.\n\nWhat about the monuments debate? The last civil war veteran died in 1959, but the conflict rumbles on in various guises and upon various proxy battlefields, as America continues to grapple with the original sin of slavery.\n\nBut what if she landed in the American heartland, rather than flying over it? Coastal separateness can sometimes be exaggerated, but it would be a very different experience than Los Angeles. In the Rust Belt, stretches of riverway are crowded again with coal barges, and local business leaders believe in the Trump Bump because they see it in their order books and balance sheets.\n\nIn the Coal Belt, there's been delight at the rescinding of Obama's Clean Power Plan. In the Bible Belt, evangelicals behold Trump as a fellow victim of sneering liberal elites. In the Sun Belt, close to the Mexican border, there's wide support for his crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Can coal make a comeback under Trump?\n\nIn many football stadiums, she would hear the chorus of boos from fans who agree with the president that the take-the-knee protests denigrate the flag. In bars, union branches and American Legion halls, you'll find many who applaud Donald Trump for 'telling like it is', refusing to be bound by norms of presidential behaviour or political correctness.\n\nThere are pointers of national success elsewhere. The New York Stock Exchange is still reaching record highs. Business confidence is on the up. Unemployment is at a 16-year low. Of the 62 million people who voted for Trump, a large number continue to regard him more as a national saviour than a national embarrassment.\n\nIn many red states, 'Make America Great Again' echoes just as strongly as it did 12 months ago. Trump has a historically low approval rating of just 35%, but it's 78% among Republicans.\n\nIn the international realm, it's plausible foreign adversaries fear the United States more under Trump than Obama, and foreign allies no longer take the country for granted. The so-called Islamic State has been driven from Raqqa. Twenty-five Nato allies have pledged to increase defence spending. Beijing, under pressure from Washington, appears to be exerting more economic leverage over Pyongyang.\n\nHowever, America First increasingly means America alone, most notably on the Paris climate change accord and the Iranian nuclear deal. Trump has also Twitter-shamed longstanding allies, such as Germany and Australia, and infuriated its closest friend Britain, with rash tweets about crime rates and terror attacks.\n\nHis labelling of foes such as Kim Jong Un as Little Rocket Man seems juvenile and self-diminishing. It hardly reaches the Reagan standard of 'tear down this wall'. Indeed, with North Korea, there's the widespread fear that Trump's tweet tirades could spark a nuclear confrontation.\n\nFew countries look anymore to Trump's America as a global exemplar, the 'city upon a hill' Reagan spoke of in his farewell address to the nation. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is routinely described as the leader of the free world, the moniker bestowed on the US president since the days of FDR.\n\nThe Economist, which trolls Trump almost weekly, has described Chinese President Xi Jinping as the most powerful man in the world. American exceptionalism is now commonly viewed as a negative construct. 'Only in America' is a term of derision.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nRonald Reagan used to talk of the 11th commandment - No Republican should speak ill of another Republican. So it is worth noting that some of Trump's most caustic and thoughtful critics have come from within his own party. Senator Jeff Flake called him 'a danger to democracy'.\n\nBob Corker described the White House as an 'adult day care centre'. John McCain, a frequent critic, has railed against 'spurious, half-baked nationalism'. George W Bush sounded the alarm about bigotry being emboldened and of how politics 'seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication', without specifically naming the current president.\n\nTrump's determination to be an anti-president has arguably had a vandalising effect on the office of the presidency, and to civil society more broadly. Artists have boycotted the White House reception held ahead of the annual Kennedy Center Awards, a red letter night in the country's cultural calendar.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors were disinvited from appearing at the White House after their championship win because of the take-the-knee protest. It's new for these kinds of commemorations to become contested.\n\nTrump has even politicised one of the commander-in-chief's most solemn acts, offering condolences to the families of the fallen. It led to an indecorous row with a war widow. Small wonder long time Washington watchers, on both the right and left, consider this the nastiest and most graceless presidency of the modern era.\n\nThe corollary is the historical stock of his predecessors is rising. When the five living former presidents appeared together in Texas earlier this month they were greeted like a group of superheroes donning their capes for one final mission. It speaks of these unreal times that George W Bush is spoken of fondly, even wistfully, by long-time liberal foes.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The five living former US presidents unite\n\nTrump's claim he could be just as presidential as Abraham Lincoln is one of the more comical boasts to come from the White House. Then there are the falsehoods, the 'alternative facts' and attacks on the 'fake media' - his label for news organisations such as the New York Times and Washington Post, whose reporting has rarely been better. Recently he has even threatened to revoke the licences of networks whose news divisions have published critical stories. To some it has shades of 1984, but Orwell's version.\n\nAs for Morning in America, it has a new connotation - checking Trump's Twitter for pre-dawn tweets. The president commonly starts the day by lashing out at opponents or mercilessly mocking them. The new normal, it is often called. But it seems more apt to call it the new abnormal.\n\nThere is an extent to which America is politics-proof and president-proof. However bad things got in Washington, my sense has long been that the US would be rescued by its other vital centres of power. New York, its financial and cultural capital. San Francisco, its tech hub. Boston, its academic first city. Hollywood, its entertainment centre.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Adrienne Mccallister, director of Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality business development at Google, speaks during a launch event\n\nBut Los Angeles is reeling from the Harvey Weinstein revelations, the Uber scandal has shone a harsh light on corporate ethics in the tech sector and the Wells Fargo affair has once again shown Wall Street in a dismal light.\n\nUS universities dominate global rankings, but its top colleges could hardly be described as engines of intergenerational mobility. A study by the New York Times of 38 colleges, including Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth, showed that students from the top 1% income bracket occupied more places than the students from the bottom 60%. Of this year's intake at Harvard, almost a third were the sons and daughters of alumni.\n\nAutomation will also continue to be a jobs killer. One study this year predicted that nearly 40% of US jobs will be lost to computers and machines over the next 15 years. Spending time in the Rust Belt valleys around Pittsburgh last year I was struck by how many taxi and Uber drivers used to work in the steel industry. Now America's one-time Steel City is a centre of excellence for robotics and where Uber is road testing its driverless cars.\n\nThere's still truth in the adage that America is always going to hell, but it never quite gets there. But how that is being tested. Presently, it feels more like a continent than a country, with shared land occupied by warring tribes. Not a failing state but not a united states.\n\nAs I've travelled this country, I struggle to identify where Americans will find common political ground. Not in the guns debate. Not in the abortion debate. Not in the healthcare debate. Not even in the singing of the national anthem at American football games. Even a cataclysmic event on the scale of 9/11 failed to unify the country.\n\nIf anything it sowed the seeds of further division, especially over immigration. Some Americans agree with Donald Trump that arrivals from mainly Muslim countries need to be blocked. Others see that as an American anathema.\n\nWhen I made my first journey to the US all those years ago I witnessed a coming together. Those Olympic celebrations were in some ways an orgy of nationalism, but there was also a commonality of spirit and purpose. From Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue performed on 84 grand pianos to a polyglot team of athletes bedecked with medals.\n\nFrom the pilot who flew around the LA Coliseum in a jet pack to the customers who left McDonald's with free Big Macs. There was reason for rejoicing. The present was golden. America felt like America again.\n\n.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41826022","None"
"Will Christian Pulisic be the next big name in soccer?\nThe biggest soccer stars in the world are known by one name: Pele. Ronaldo. Messi. The United States has never produced that kind of world-class talent, but a 19-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania, is poised to change that. Christian Pulisic is not only the youngest player on the U.S. National Team, he may just be the best American to ever play the game. This week, Pulisic will play with Team USA as it tries to qualify for the World Cup. For the last two years, he's been playing professionally with one of the most revered clubs in Europe. We spent time with the young American in Germany where he is already a household name.\n\nThe biggest soccer stars in the world are known by one name: Pele. Ronaldo. Messi.

Christian Pulisic is not only the youngest player on the U.S. National Team, he may just be the best American to ever play the game. This week, Pulisic will play with Team USA as it tries to qualify for the World Cup. For the last two years, he's been playing professionally with one of the most revered clubs in Europe. We spent time with the young American in Germany where he is already a household name.When 80,000 fans scream your name, you better deliver. This is Dortmund, Germany. Anyone who says that Germans are not emotional has never stood at the base of Dortmund's south stand. It's called 'the yellow wall.' 25,000 thousand fans bounce along with the ball from misery to euphoria, a collective, manic mood swing that would put most teenagers to shame.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: The whole podium is shaking.\n\n'It makes you think that this is gonna be perhaps the first American superstar in the sport.'\n\nThe yellow wall lives by two rules: no sitting in the stands, and no excuses on the field. Even if you are a shy 19-year-old 4,000 miles from home.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: It's loud.\n\nChristian Pulisic: Yeah. It's really loud. You can't hear your teammates from 10 yards away, trying to talk to you.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Is it intimidating, at all?\n\nChristian Pulisic: It is intimidating at times. But I think, as you gain experience, and after I played more and more games, it just gets easier and easier.\n\nHe certainly makes it look easy. Christian Pulisic was 17 when he scored his first goal for Dortmund. The youngest American ever to score in the German pros. He celebrated like any teenager would: with a dab.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How do you say 'dab' in German?\n\nChristian Pulisic: Dab, it's the same.\n\nWhat makes Christian Pulisic special, and so fun to watch, is his explosive speed. His passing ability can seem clairvoyant at times. And he can shoot like a sniper. At 19, Pulisic has scored as many professional goals as Lionel Messi – the world's greatest player -- had when he was 19.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you feel like people are expecting you to be the next Messi?\n\nChristian Pulisic: I think it's what American fans, soccer fans do, especially. They're looking for the next star, the next player to be the face of U.S. soccer and all the stuff I hear every day.\n\nFour million American kids play youth soccer, more than in any other country. But the U.S. men's team has never produced an international superstar and never made it to the finals of the World Cup. This year, the team is struggling to qualify. They were 0 and 2 when Bruce Arena was named coach in November. One of his first moves was to unleash Pulisic and build the game plan around him.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What did you think when you saw him play in person?\n\nBruce Arena: First of all you don't think he's an American.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And that's a compliment.\n\nBruce Arena: It's a compliment. He looks like a natural on the field and he moves gracefully, he's strong for his size, his speed is incredible, his first touch is good.\n\nPulisic is a game-changer. Watch as he dances around defenders and somehow finds a teammate for a goal. He has either set up or scored 9 of the USA's last 11 goals.\n\nBruce Arena: It makes you think that this is gonna be perhaps the first American superstar in the sport.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You're willing to say that?\n\nBruce Arena: I'm willing to say that.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: A lot of people are hedging.\n\nBruce Arena: You have to be hesitant about this but this is a very talented young man.\n\nCBS News\n\nKelley Pulisic: Sometimes, I'm laying in bed at night and thinking 'Wow, this is really happening' and you really don't feel like it's real.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: There was never a master plan?\n\nMark Pulisic: No, there's no master plan. Not even close.\n\nMark and Kelley Pulisic met at George Mason University where they both played soccer. Mark is a professional coach. Kelley just retired as a phys-ed teacher. They have three children -- Chase, Dee Dee and Christian -- their youngest.\n\nKelley Pulisic: Everything he does has to be at a very high level. He doesn't like to fail. And he wants it to be perfect. When he was two years old he would color. And he would color out of the lines and just flip out. And I'm thinking, 'What's wrong with this kid?' And basically I didn't want to color with him anymore. And what had happened was I bought white-out for a two-year-old. And he would get the white out and go around the edges to make it perfect. I've never seen anything like that. I have two other kids and I'm thinking this isn't normal. And that's like his personality in a nutshell, at two years old he had to keep in the lines.\n\nHe became obsessed with soccer and before he started kindergarten had mastered one of the sports most difficult skills: playing with both feet. He'd play for hours in the yard. When his parents finally coaxed him inside for dinner, he'd pass under this sign -- confidence -- the one-word Gospel according to Mark.\n\nMark Pulisic: He was always playing up against older kids so I said there was only one thing you can never lose -- you always have to play with confidence. That you belong. So I wrote it up there. I did a spell check first to make sure it would be spelled properly.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: So you would have full confidence!\n\nMark Pulisic: Because I knew it would be there.\n\nThe boy wonder ran circles around older kids all over Pennsylvania.\n\nKelley Pulisic: He was really small. And I'd hear people going 'Oh, who brought their little brother? Oh, they probably didn't have enough players -- somebody's little brother is out there.'\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Isn't that sweet.\n\nKelley Pulisic: And then the game would go on and he'd get the ball and do something and I'd just kind of giggle because they were like, 'Oh look at that little kid!' Someone mark him, cover him!\n\nBy the time he was 12, pro-scouts around the world noticed him too.\n\nKelley Pulisic: We would get calls constantly. 'Oh can Christian play with us' and we really had to find the balance of what was too much.\n\nMark Pulisic: And I just think what we just did differently was made sure that we didn't put him in a structured environment all the time. He played for one team. He would practice twice a week and play a game on the weekend.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: That sounds pretty normal.\n\nMark Pulisic: Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You hear stories about these parents who are doing thousands of miles in their car taking their kids everywhere, special coaches, special diets, backyard workouts.\n\nMark Pulisic: Doesn't work.\n\nMark Pulisic: You didn't do that with Christian? You didn't keep him on a gluten free, fat-free diet?\n\nMark Pulisic: After games we were more Slurpees and Doritos, right?\n\nKelley Pulisic: Oh yeah.\n\nThe Pulisics decided to see if Christian could cut it in one of the most competitive leagues in the world. At 16, he signed with Dortmund, a club that has a reputation for building stars.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why do you have to come to Germany to play? Obviously there are a ton of teams in the U.S. that would love to have you?\n\nChristian Pulisic: As a kid, I just always learned that if you want to be the best, you have to play against the best.\n\nPulisic's father moved with him and enrolled Christian in a German high school.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What was school like?\n\nChristian Pulisic: I remember going in the first day and the teachers would start talking to me in German. And then the other kids would say 'He doesn't speak German' and then I'm thinking to myself 'How is no one aware of that?'\n\nKelley Pulisic: He calls me after his first day of school, 'Mom, mom.' 'Hey what's up Christian?' 'I went to school today. I sat in a class. I don't know what class it was.'\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Was he a little lonely at first?\n\nKelley Pulisic: It was very lonely.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And what would you say to him?\n\nKelley Pulisic: I said Christian what do you want to do? Do you want to stay? I said because believe it or not it would be a lot easier for you to come home on everybody. 'No, no, no Mom I don't want to come home.'\n\nDortmund is a blue-collar town with rusted steel mills and a Pittsburgh feel, right down to the team colors. On match day the exodus from the streets to the stadium is lubricated with beer and bratwurst.\n\n(PULISIC) Before the game, even, you're still in the locker room and you hear them singing, 'You'll never walk alone,' and it kinda just goes throughout the whole stadium. And you feel it and it just gets you really pumped.\n\n(PULISIC) Overwhelming. Just when I saw his back, number 22, going onto the field, like, I can't even--\n\n(PULISIC) Don't cry.\n\n(PULISIC) I can't describe it.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Because that's your little -- your little boy.\n\nPulisic has been embraced by the notoriously unforgiving Dortmund fans. Partly because he's become fluent in German, it took him a year, but mostly because he mastered their precise style of play. To sharpen his skills Dortmund uses this. The club's creation called 'the footbonaut.' It is German engineering at its most twisted. Balls are fired as fast as 60 miles an hour, Christian's job is to hit the randomly lighted squares.\n\nChristian Pulisic: My dad, there are times where he'll just be like - 'stop being cocky. Just shut up. Stop being cocky, or you're not, you're not anywhere yet.\n\nMark Pulisic: He doesn't like it when I say it, because I've been a coach my whole life and those players never succeed, you know? They're flashes in the pans.\n\nMark Pulisic did cave a bit on flash when his son, who earns more than $8 million a year, begged to fly from a national team practice in Kansas City to join his friends at Hershey high's senior prom.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How'd you get there?\n\nChristian Pulisic: I took a private jet. Looking back at it it's a little weird. I can't believe I did that.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You probably blew through your whole allowance, right?\n\nChristian Pulisic: Yeah, maybe. I don't regret it, though.\n\nAfter partying all night, he flew back and scored his first goal for Team USA.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Pretty good 24 hours.\n\nChristian Pulisic: Yeah. It was pretty special.\n\nThat goal ignited the hopes of U.S. soccer fans hungry for a world-class player. We saw it this summer. We were with him in Hershey. He was invited to sign a few autographs. This is the line that was waiting for him.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: There's no way he'll ever get through all these kids.\n\nKelley Pulisic: He'll have to sign fast.\n\nPulisic was enjoying some of the benefits of fame, but his mother said don't be fooled by his smile.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What do you think this is like for Christian?\n\nKelley Pulisic: I think it's a lot for him. You know sometimes I think he just wants to turn it all off and he just wants to, you know, go home and watch TV.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What do you say to him before something like this?\n\nKelley Pulisic: Oh, I just, I-- I just, it's like, 'Get your game face on.' Because you know, he's gotta go and he's gotta play the part, and it's almost the same as I say before a game. So he's gotta prepare for this.\n\nNo soccer academy can prepare you for this. Remember he's 19. Really, he just wants to play. Whether it's a pick-up basketball game, or showing-up his teammates. Moves like those and his boy next-door looks make him a marketers dream. Pulisic already has deals with Nike, Gatorade and you guessed it -- Hershey Chocolate. Top European teams want a piece too. They've offered Dortmund as much as $40 million for the young American.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-christian-pulisic-be-the-next-big-name-in-soccer/","None"
"Human Feet Still Washing Up In Pacific Northwest, But Don't Panic\nHuman Feet Still Washing Up In Pacific Northwest, But Don't Panic\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Streeter Lecka/Getty Images Streeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nLast week, another human foot washed ashore near Sooke, Canada, on Vancouver Island — the 13th foot found in British Columbia in the last decade.\n\nHuman feet have also had a tendency to wash ashore in Washington state.\n\nThe most recent foot (with lower leg bones tibia and fibula attached) was encountered by a man walking his dogs in the town of Jordan River, the CBC reports.\n\nThe man picked up the foot and took it home before calling police. For the record, the authorities say, if you find a foot on the shore, you should call the authorities and they'll retrieve it — no need to hand-carry the foot home.\n\nYou might have some questions about why Canadian police would be calmly advising citizens of proper foot-spotting protocol.\n\nBasically, feet washing up in the Pacific Northwest — while not an everyday occurrence — is not particularly unusual, let alone a sign of something sinister.\n\nNPR's own Mark Memmott wrote about this mystery back in 2011, with some help from Jake Ellison, then a reporter at NPR member station KPLU.\n\nEllison, examining the mystery of the floating feet, opened his story with: 'There are likely hundreds of dead human bodies in the waters of the Northwest at any given time.'\n\nMark explained:\n\n'When you think about it, of course, that makes some sense. There are 3.4 million or so people in the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area. To the north, 2 million people live in or around Vancouver, B.C. Those are sizable populations. Sad as it is to think about, that means bodies are going to end up in the water for one reason or another (accidents, suicides and perhaps murders come to mind). 'According to Jake's reporting, the Northwest's cold waters can help preserve human remains for long periods — sometimes years. But eventually, bodies do break apart. And then, if a foot happens to be in a type of shoe that floats, it can end up getting carried ashore. 'That's a rather unexciting explanation for something that's gotten people speculating that there's a killer on the loose. But sometimes facts do get in the way of good stories.'\n\nCoroners in British Columbia are working to identify the erstwhile owner of the newly found foot.\n\nEight of the 12 previously discovered feet have been identified, Canadian authorities say, and tied to six individuals. 'In none of the cases was any foul play involved,' officials wrote last year.\n\nCitizens along the Canadian coast are taking the latest foot with a shrug of the shoulders.\n\nMike Johns, the man who found the foot, told The New York Times that he carried it home out of concern that, as the Times put it, 'it would have washed back into the ocean or attracted the bear hanging around town' had he left it.\n\nAnd a nearby cafe owner told the Times that the scientific explanation of feet floating off from decomposing corpses is satisfying to residents.\n\n'At the beginning, it seemed more strange,' Joshua Constandinou told the Times, 'but now it happens so many times.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/12/570189142/human-feet-still-washing-up-in-pacific-northwest-but-dont-panic","1513054800.0"
"A neo-Nazi converted to Islam and killed 2 roommates for ‘disrespecting’ his faith, police say\nDevon Arthurs. (Tampa Police Department)\n\nA former neo-Nazi who converted to Islam is accused of killing his two roommates because they “disrespected” his new faith, police said.\n\nLast Friday evening, police arrested 18-year-old Devon Arthurs after he briefly held three people at gunpoint at a smoke shop in Tampa, then surrendered to officers.\n\nThat incident, it turned out, was only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nDuring the arrest, Arthurs mentioned to police that people in an apartment across the street were “definitely dead,” according to Tampa Police Department records.\n\nWhen officers entered that apartment, in a manicured upscale complex in north Tampa, they found the bodies of two of Arthurs’s roommates, 22-year-old Jeremy Himmelman and 18-year-old Andrew Oneschuk. Both men had gunshot wounds to the upper body and head and were dead, records stated.\n\nOutside the apartment, a fourth roommate, 21-year-old Brandon Russell, was “crying and was visibly upset,” police said.\n\n“He doesn’t know what’s going on and just found (the two dead roommates) like you guys did,” Arthurs told police.\n\nWhat followed was a chilling confession in which Arthurs described in “specific details” how and why he had killed two of his roommates earlier, police said. According to records, Arthurs told officers that “all of them had been friends with a common neo-Nazi belief” until Arthurs converted to Islam:\n\nSince then, Arthurs stated, he has become angered by the world’s anti-Muslim sentiment and had wanted to bring attention to his cause. Arthurs also stated that, before the murder, he had been privy to neo-Nazi Internet chat sites threatening to kill people, and he had developed a thinking that he should take some of the neo-Nazis with him.\n\nArthurs had displayed some of his ideology when he walked into the Green Planet Smoke Shop about 5:30 p.m. Friday — presumably after killing his roommates — and produced a gun, ordering a customer and employee to “get the f— on the ground,” according to police.\n\n[This school staged a ‘Color Wars’ pep rally. Then students showed up in ‘White Pride’ shirts.]\n\nAfter a second customer walked into the store, Arthurs told all three hostages that he had already killed someone and was “upset due to America bombing his Muslim countries,” a police report stated.\n\nWhen Tampa police officers arrived about five minutes later, Arthurs surrendered after a brief standoff and was placed under arrest. According to police, he exclaimed “Allah Mohammed!” as he was being walked to a patrol car, and told officers: “I had to do it. This wouldn’t have had to happen if your country didn’t bomb my country.”\n\nCounty arrest records indicate Arthurs was born in Florida.\n\nIt is unclear if and when Arthurs actually converted to Islam, was an observant Muslim or ever attended a mosque. “Allah Mohammad,” which Arthurs exclaimed to police as he was being led to the patrol car, is not a Muslim phrase.\n\nIn a search of the apartment Arthurs shared with his three roommates, officers discovered bomb-making equipment in the garage, including fuses and a cooler containing a “white cake-like substance” that bomb squad technicians recognized as the explosive HMTD (hexamethylene triperoxide diamine), according to a criminal complaint filed by the FBI in U.S. District Court.\n\nInside a bedroom belonging to Russell, the roommate who had been crying when police arrived, officers found firearms, ammunition and “Nazi/white supremacist propaganda,” including a framed picture of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh on the dresser. McVeigh was sentenced to death for the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which killed 168 and was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil before Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nRussell told investigators that he had made the HMTD and was the owner of the fuses found in the garage. He explained that he formerly belonged to an engineering club at the University of South Florida and had used the HMTD to “boost homemade rockets and send balloons into the atmosphere for testing,” according to the complaint.\n\n[White nationalist Richard Spencer’s ex-classmates decry him — by raising money for refugees]\n\n“Based on my training and experience, HMTD is too energetic and volatile for these types of uses,” an FBI agent noted in the complaint.\n\nRussell also admitted to being a “national socialist” who harbored neo-Nazi beliefs, and said he was a member of a group called the “Atom Waffen” (German for “atomic weapon”), the complaint said. The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the “Atomwaffen Division” as a hate group that shares “a hatred for Jews and an admiration for Adolf Hitler and Nazis.”\n\nThe FBI obtained a warrant for Russell’s arrest Saturday for the possession of an unregistered destructive device and the unlawful storage of explosive material.

"SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rocket, lighting up SoCal skies\nSpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from California Friday evening, boosting a fourth batch of 10 Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit in the rocket-builder's 18th launch this year -- a modern record -- and its fourth for the satellite telephone company.\n\nThe rocket put on a spectacular sunset sky show across southern California, prompting multiple tweets from surprised residents marveling at the view, including one re-tweeted by SpaceX founder Elon Musk in which a viewer worried she was witnessing a nuclear bomb. Musk titled the tweet: 'Nuclear alien UFO from North Korea.'\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA / REUTERS\n\nIt was the fifth launch of a previously flown Falcon 9 first stage and while SpaceX normally attempts to recover stages for refurbishment and relaunch, the company said before launch no attempt would be made to land the first stage this time around\n\nInstead, engineers carried out a series of tests before the stage crashed into the Pacific Ocean south of Vandenberg Air Force Base.\n\nWOW!!! The view from LA is amazing!!!! People are going to freak out #spacex #IridiumNEXT pic.twitter.com/0mznMRvDKI — Amanda (@alias_amanda) December 23, 2017\n\nThe second stage, meanwhile, boosted 10 Iridium NEXT spacecraft into a preliminary orbit around Earth's poles. After a second upper stage rocket firing 51 minutes after launch, the 10 spacecraft were released, one at a time, to fly on their own.\n\nIt was the fourth batch in a $3 billion 81-satellite constellation intended to replace Iridium's current fleet of aging low-Earth-orbit mobile voice and data relay stations.\n\nSpaceX successfully launched the first 10 Iridium NEXT spacecraft on Jan. 14, a second set on June 25 and a third on Oct. 8. The new satellites are being phased in as first-generation relay stations are retired.\n\nThe complete Iridium NEXT network requires 66 satellites in six orbital planes to enable users anywhere in the world to make and receive satellite phone calls. Iridium plans to eventually launch 15 in-orbit spares, using SpaceX to put 75 of the 81 planned satellites into orbit.\n\nWith the fourth batch successfully in orbit, SpaceX will turn its attention to readying a new heavy-lift rocket for its maiden flight from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center early next year.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy, made up of three Falcon 9 stages strapped together with an upper stage atop the center core vehicle, will have a liftoff thrust of 5.1 million pounds, making it the most powerful rocket since NASA's space shuttle.\n\nThe rocket's long-awaited maiden flight, carrying SpaceX founder Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster sports car as a whimsical test payload of sorts, is expected in January. SpaceX also plans to launch three other missions in January using standard Falcon 9s.\n\nFriday's flight got underway at 5:27:34 p.m. PT when the nine Merlin 1D engines in the Falcon 9's first stage ignited with a burst of flame, generating 1.7 million pounds of thrust. Moments later, the rocket was released from its firing stand to begin the climb to space.\n\nRacing away to the south over the Pacific Ocean west of Los Angeles, the first stage engines burned for about two minutes and 33 seconds to boost the rocket and its payload out of the thick lower atmosphere.\n\nThe engines shut down on time, the stage fell away and the second stage's single Merlin engine then ignited for the first of two 'burns' needed to get the Iridium satellites into a roughly circular polar orbit. The first stage, meanwhile, fell back to Earth, crashing into the Pacific Ocean after a series of tests.\n\nEach satellite in Iridium's constellation is able to communicate with up to four others to provide a global network that services hand-held phones, machine-to-machine devices and ship- and aircraft-born data transmitters.\n\nThe new spacecraft carry equipment provided by Harris Corp. to track ships at sea on a minute-by-minute basis and another Harris-built device, provided by a multi-agency consortium known as Aireon, that can track aircraft anywhere in the world.\n\nThe 1,896-pound Iridium NEXT satellites were designed by the European aerospace giant Thales Alenia Space and built by Orbital ATK in Arizona.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launches-10-more-iridium-next-satellites/","None"
"Why the UN is investigating extreme poverty … in America, the world's richest nation\nAt the heart of Philip Alston’s special mission will be one question: can Americans enjoy fundamental human rights if they’re unable to meet basic living standards?\n\nThe United Nations monitor on extreme poverty and human rights has embarked on a coast-to-coast tour of the US to hold the world’s richest nation – and its president – to account for the hardships endured by America’s most vulnerable citizens.\n\nThe tour, which kicked off on Friday morning, will make stops in four states as well as Washington DC and the US territory of Puerto Rico. It will focus on several of the social and economic barriers that render the American dream merely a pipe dream to millions – from homelessness in California to racial discrimination in the Deep South, cumulative neglect in Puerto Rico and the decline of industrial jobs in West Virginia.\n\nWith 41 million Americans officially in poverty according to the US Census Bureau (other estimates put that figure much higher), one aim of the UN mission will be to demonstrate that no country, however wealthy, is immune from human suffering induced by growing inequality. Nor is any nation, however powerful, beyond the reach of human rights law – a message that the US government and Donald Trump might find hard to stomach given their tendency to regard internal affairs as sacrosanct.\n\nThe UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, is a feisty Australian and New York University law professor who has a fearsome track record of holding power to account. He tore a strip off the Saudi Arabian regime for its treatment of women months before the kingdom legalized their right to drive, denounced the Brazilian government for attacking the poor through austerity, and even excoriated the UN itself for importing cholera to Haiti.\n\nThe US is no stranger to Alston’s withering tongue, having come under heavy criticism from him for its program of drone strikes on terrorist targets abroad. In his previous role as UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Alston blamed the Obama administration and the CIA for killing many innocent civilians in attacks he said were of dubious international legality.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP\n\nNow Alston has set off on his sixth, and arguably most sensitive, visit as UN monitor on extreme poverty since he took up the position in June 2014. At the heart of his fact-finding tour will be a question that is causing increasing anxiety at a troubled time: is it possible, in one of the world’s leading democracies, to enjoy fundamental human rights such as political participation or voting rights if you are unable to meet basic living standards, let alone engage, as Thomas Jefferson put it, in the pursuit of happiness?\n\n“Despite great wealth in the US, there also exists great poverty and inequality,” Alston said in remarks released before the start of the visit. The rapporteur said he intended to focus on the detrimental effects of poverty on the civil and political rights of Americans, “given the United States’ consistent emphasis on the importance it attaches to these rights in its foreign policy, and given that it has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”\n\nThe US has an extraordinary ability to naturalize and accept the extreme poverty David Grusky, director of the Center on Poverty and Inequality\n\nPoverty experts are watching the UN tour closely in the hope that it might draw public attention to a largely neglected but critical aspect of US society.\n\nDavid Grusky, director of the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Stanford, said the visit had the potential to hold a mirror up to the country at a moment when globalization combined with a host of domestic policies have generated a vast gulf between rich and poor.\n\n“The US has an extraordinary ability to naturalize and accept the extreme poverty that exists even in the context of such extreme wealth,” he said.\n\nGrusky added that the US reaction to Alston’s visit could go either way. “It has the potential to open our eyes to what an outlier the US has become compared with the rest of the world, or it could precipitate an adverse reaction towards an outsider who has no legitimacy telling us what to do about internal US affairs.”\n\nAlston’s findings will be announced in preliminary form in Washington on 15 December, and then presented as a full report to the UN human rights council in Geneva next June. An especially unpredictable element of the fallout will be how Trump himself receives the final report, given the president’s habit of lashing out at anyone perceived to criticize him or his administration.\n\nTrump has also shown open disdain towards the world body. In the course of the 2016 presidential campaign he griped that “we get nothing out of the United Nations other than good real-estate prices”.\n\nOn the other hand, observers have been surprised that the White House has honored the invitation to host Alston after the initial offer was extended by Barack Obama. US diplomats on more than one occasion since Trump’s inauguration have said they welcomed the UN party.\n\nAlston himself is reserving his comments until the end of the tour. But his published work suggests that he is likely to be a formidable critic of the new president. In a lecture he gave last year on the challenges posed by Trump and other modern populist leaders, he warned that their agenda was “avowedly nationalistic, xenophobic, misogynistic, and explicitly antagonistic to all or much of the human rights agenda”.\n\nAlston concluded the speech by saying: “These are extraordinarily dangerous times, unprecedentedly so in my lifetime. The response is really up to us.”\n\nThe UN poverty tour falls at a singularly tense moment for the US. In its 2016 state of the nation review, the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality placed the US rank at the bottom of the league table of 10 well-off countries, in terms of the extent of its income and wealth inequality.\n\nIt also found that the US hit rock bottom in terms of the safety net it offers struggling families, and is one of the worst offenders in terms of the ability of low-income families to lift themselves out of poverty – a stark contrast to the much-vaunted myth of the American dream.\n\nTo some extent, Trump’s focus on “making America great again” – a political jingo that in itself contains an element of criticism of the state of the nation – chimes with the UN’s concern about extreme poverty. His call for greater prosperity for white working Americans in declining manufacturing areas that proved so vital to his election victory will be echoed in Alston’s visit to the depressed coal-producing state of West Virginia, which backed Trump in 2016 by a resounding 69%.\n\nIn many other ways, though, the Trump administration in its first year has taken a radically hostile approach towards communities in need. He has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to abolish Obamacare in a move that would deprive millions of low-income families of healthcare insurance, was widely criticized for his lackluster response to the hurricane disaster in Puerto Rico that has left thousands homeless and without power, and is currently pushing a tax reform that would benefit one group above all others: the super rich.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man who lost his home during Hurricane Maria in September sits on a cot at a school turned shelter in Canovanas. Photograph: Alvin Baez/Reuters\n\nThe US poses an especially challenging subject for the UN special rapporteur because unlike all other industrialized nations, it fails to recognize fundamental social and economic rights such as the right to healthcare, a roof over your head or food to keep hunger at bay. The federal government has consistently refused to sign up to the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights – arguing that these matters are best left to individual states.\n\nSuch an emphasis on states’ rights has spawned a patchwork of provision for low-income families across the country. Republican-controlled states in the Deep South provide relatively little help to those struggling from unemployment and lack of ready cash, while more assistance is likely to be forthcoming in bigger coastal cities.\n\nBy contrast, raging house prices and gentrification is fueling a homelessness crisis in liberal cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco – the first stop next week of the UN tour.\n\nMartha Davis, a law professor specializing in US human rights at Northeastern University, said that such vast regional variations present the UN monitor with a huge opportunity. Unlike other international officials, he has the ability to move freely at both federal and state levels – and be equally critical of both.\n\n“There’s a lot that Philip Alston can say about basic inequality that goes to the heart of the rights that he is reviewing,” Davis said.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/01/un-extreme-poverty-america-special-rapporteur","1512104400.0"

"Police and protesters clash in St. Louis after former officer who shot black driver acquitted on murder charges\nDemonstrators clashed with police officers Friday night in St. Louis after the acquittal of a white former police officer who was charged with murder last year for fatally shooting a black driver after a car chase.\n\nIn a video tweeted after midnight Saturday, St. Louis police Chief Lawrence O’Toole said at least 23 people had been arrested as of 6 p.m., and 10 police officers had suffered injuries, including a broken jaw and a dislocated shoulder.\n\n“Many of the demonstrators were peaceful. However, after dark, many agitators began to destroy property and assault police officers,” O’Toole said in a joint video statement with Mayor Lyda Krewson (D).\n\nO’Toole said the protesters assaulted police with bricks and bottles, and officers responded by using tear gas and firing pepper-spray balls as a “less lethal option.”\n\nRoughly 1,000 protesters descended on the mayor’s home, throwing rocks and breaking windows, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. They were met by about 200 police in riot gear who tried to disperse them with tear gas. The mayor did not appear to be home.\n\nThe night of violence began with peaceful demonstrations earlier in the day after a judge acquitted former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley for killing Anthony Lamar Smith in December 2011.\n\nIn a court document submitted by the St. Louis circuit attorney, the investigator on the case said Stockley and another officer had been chasing Smith at speeds up to 80 mph when Stockley said he was “going to kill this motherf‑‑‑er, don’t you know it” and told the officer to drive into Smith’s slowing car.\n\nThe document said Stockley then approached Smith’s window and fired five times into the car, hitting Smith “with each shot” and killing him. In addition, prosecutors accused the officer of planting a gun on the victim: There was a gun found in Smith’s car, but it was later determined to have DNA only from Stockley.\n\n[Former St. Louis police officer charged with murder in fatal 2011 shooting of black man]\n\nJudge Timothy Wilson, the circuit judge who heard the case in a bench trial, acquitted Stockley on the murder charge as well as a charge of armed criminal action in a 30-page order released Friday morning.\n\nWilson wrote that he was “simply not firmly convinced” of Stockley’s guilt, saying that “agonizingly,” he went over the case’s evidence repeatedly. Ultimately, Wilson said, he was not convinced that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Stockley “did not act in self-defense.”\n\nFollowing the verdict, Smith’s mother, Annie, said the judge made the wrong decision.\n\n“Justice wasn’t served. I can never be at peace,” she told Fox2Now.\n\nIn an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Stockley, 36, who relocated to Houston, acknowledged the hurt Smith’s family is feeling. “I know everyone wants someone to blame,” he told the newspaper, “but I’m just not the guy.”\n\nWhen asked why he agreed to address the case, tears filled his eyes. “Because I did nothing wrong,” he said. “If you’re telling the truth and you’ve been wrongly accused, you should shout it from the rooftops.”\n\nA West Point graduate who served with the Army in Iraq, Stockley said that his job as a St. Louis cop grew so dangerous, he began carrying unauthorized weapons with extra rounds.\n\n“I accept full responsibility for violating the rules,” he said. “But it’s not a moral crime. It’s a rule violation.”\n\n\n\nProtesters gather Friday in St. Louis after a judge found a white former St. Louis police officer, Jason Stockley, not guilty of first-degree murder in the death of a black man, Anthony Lamar Smith, who was fatally shot following a high-speed chase in 2011.

Eric Greitens (R), who had put the state’s National Guard on standby ahead of the verdict and potential protests, chastised those who engaged in violence, saying it “is not going to be tolerated here in the state of Missouri.”\n\nBefore the verdict was announced, Greitens stood with Christina Wilson, Smith’s fiancee, to deliver a joint message asking people to protest peacefully.\n\n“If you feel like you want to speak out, speak how you feel,” Wilson said at the news briefing. “And whatever comes to you, just do it in a peaceful way.”\n\nGreitens, speaking after Wilson, urged people who felt pain after the verdict not to “turn that pain into violence.”\n\n“One life has been lost in this case, and we don’t need more bloodshed,” he said.\n\n[Video footage shows Minn. traffic stop that ended with Philando Castile’s death]\n\n\n\nMackenzie Marks washes out her eyes after being pepper-sprayed. “They boxed us in and started pepper-spraying us,” Marks said. (Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP)\n\nNeil J. Bruntrager, an attorney for Stockley, said in a telephone interview that the judge’s detailed opinion explaining the verdict was his “best effort in that regard to make sure people understand why he did what he did.”\n\nThe unrest has gripped the St. Louis region, which was rocked in 2014 when an officer in suburban Ferguson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager.\n\nThat shooting prompted intense, sometimes violent protests, as did the decision months later not to indict that officer, Darren Wilson. The case, and the protests that followed, garnered worldwide attention and in many ways kick-started the nationwide focus on police officers’ use of deadly force, particularly against black men and boys.\n\nSince Ferguson, police shootings or other uses of force — and decisions not to charge the officers in most of the cases involved — have set off heated protests in New York, Baltimore, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Charlotte and other cities across the country.\n\nBut the specter of Ferguson has lingered over St. Louis, which last month marked the third anniversary of Brown’s death. It has also fueled a change in the way local officials respond to shootings and potential protests, with officials in some cases hurrying to release information to avoid becoming “another Ferguson,” as one civil rights leader put it after a police shooting in his community.\n\n[Minn. officer acquitted in shooting of Philando Castile during traffic stop, dismissed from police force]\n\nKrewson, the city’s mayor, said in a statement Friday she is “appalled” by what happened to Smith.\n\n“I am sobered by this outcome,” she wrote. “I will continue my work to create a more equitable community.”\n\nBefore the verdict, activists in the St. Louis region pledged “mass disruption” should Stockley wind up getting acquitted, vowing the outcome would “look a lot like Ferguson.”\n\nDemonstrators began gathering in the streets after the acquittal Friday, growing in size as the day wore on.\n\nDemonstrators stopped briefly in front of @BPVSTL yelling, 'Whose streets?'

Mittman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, said Smith “died unnecessarily” in 2011.\n\n“This region — and our country as a whole — have seen too many deaths caused by police, with little accountability for the officers or department involved,” Mittman said in a statement.\n\nSmith’s death preceded the wave of police shootings and other uses of force that captured national attention recently. Stockley was ultimately charged last year after new evidence emerged from the St. Louis city police and the FBI, according to the circuit attorney, who did not disclose what that was. According to the circuit attorney’s office, the St. Louis police’s internal affairs investigators contacted them in March 2016 with this new evidence that ultimately made the prosecutor pursue charges.\n\n\n\nFormer St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley. (St. Louis Police Department/AP)\n\nProsecutors said during the trial that they believe Stockley, who left the St. Louis police force in 2013, planted a gun on Smith after the shooting.\n\nAttorneys for Stockley said the officer acted in self-defense because he feared that Smith was going to shoot him. When he testified, Stockley denied planting the gun in Smith’s car, saying he first touched it when searching the vehicle.\n\nIn his order acquitting Stockley on Friday, Wilson said he did not believe evidence supported the prosecution’s argument that the officer planted the gun.\n\nWilson outlined a history of the case, saying that Smith’s car crashed into a police vehicle before driving off. Stockley fired shots at Smith’s car before they pursued him in a high-speed car chase that Wilson said lasted three minutes, endangered drivers and pedestrians and was “stressful” for the officers involved.\n\nAccording to Wilson’s account, which in part is based on the dashboard camera from the police car, Stockley approached Smith’s car with his hand on his holstered gun and then appeared to wrestle “with something or someone at the window.” Stockley is then seen drawing his gun and firing.\n\nA medical examiner later said that Smith had been shot five times, with one bullet going through Smith’s heart, Wilson wrote. The medical examiner could not say whether Smith was reaching for anything when he was shot.\n\nWilson said that he did not believe Stockley’s actions after the pursuit were “consistent with the conduct of a person intentionally killing another person unlawfully,” noting that Stockley did not immediately open fire when approaching Smith’s car and adding that the officer had been told Smith had a gun.\n\n“No one promised a rose garden, and this surely is not one,” Wilson wrote.\n\nWilson also discussed Stockley’s comment about killing Smith, saying that the pursuit was stressful for the officers involved, noting that “people say all kinds of things in the heat of the moment or while in stressful situations.”\n\nBruntrager, Stockley’s attorney, said that while it is terrible when someone loses their life, Stockley felt some “personal satisfaction” because Wilson’s order showed he viewed the former officer as credible.\n\n“Particularly police officers who’ve been through this, they know what they know, they know what they saw,” Bruntrager said of officers facing charges or possible charges after fatal shootings. “When they hear someone say, ‘Yes, I believe that is what happened,’ that makes a difference.”\n\n\n\nOfficials begin erecting barricades outside the Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse in St. Louis. (Christian Gooden/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP)\n\nThe decision to charge Stockley last year came as the number of law enforcement officers charged for deadly on-duty shootings has increased, which experts have attributed to an increase in video evidence and public pressure. But the increased number of charges have not led to more convictions, which remain very rare in cases involving officers charged for shooting someone or using deadly force while on duty.\n\nIn the span of a week this summer, juries opted against convicting three police officers charged in high-profile shootings that were captured on video. In each of those cases, the video and the case prompted protests and unrest. In each of those cases, prosecutors filed charges and decried what had happened. Each case ended with an acquittal, showing what law enforcement officials and experts say are the limitations of video evidence.\n\n“This not guilty verdict of a police officer who violently killed a citizen is another slap in the face to the black community in St. Louis. And a shot in the heart to the family of the victim,” Missouri State Rep. Michael Butler (D-St. Louis) said in a statement issued Friday morning, adding that the verdict has left him “appalled.”\n\n“This system and all the politicians calling for peace are ignoring the pain this verdict causes our communities. Anthony Lamar Smith is dead from a violent act and you want us to be peaceful? You want us to not feel anger? The very people paid to protect us are killing us, paid to make peace are perpetuating violence, and we are supposed to be peaceful?” he wrote. “We will be nonviolent but we will not settle on peace. No justice. No peace.”\n\nThis story has been updated since it was first published.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe Washington Post’s database of police shootings this year\n\nFormer Milwaukee police officer acquitted in fatal shooting of Sylville Smith\n\nMistrial declared in case of South Carolina officer who shot Walter Scott after traffic stop","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/15/st-louis-tenses-for-verdict-in-murder-trial-of-former-police-officer/","1505448000.0"
"#MeToo reaches 85 countries with 1.7M tweets\nThe 'Me Too' social media movement, which went viral after actress Alyssa Milano shared it on Twitter, has reached dozens of countries and millions of people. Twitter confirmed to CBS News that over 1.7 million tweets included the hashtag '#MeToo,' with 85 countries that had at least 1,000 #MeToo tweets.\n\nThe hashtag quickly went viral in the wake of dozens of sexual harassment and assault accusations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nOne tweet has brought together 1.7 million voices from 85 countries. Standing side by side, together, our movement will only grow. #MeToo — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 24, 2017\n\nThe hot topic is not only on Twitter. Last Tuesday, Facebook released statistics showing that there were more than 12 million posts, comments and reactions regarding 'Me Too' in less than 24 hours, by 4.7 million users around the world. As of last Tuesday, Facebook said 45 percent of users in the U.S. have had friends who posted 'me too.'\n\nOn Oct. 15, Milano shared a tweet explaining that if people who have been sexually assaulted or harassed tweet 'me too,' it might 'give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.' Millions responded, including high-profile celebrities like America Ferrera, Rose McGowan, Evan Rachel Wood, Gabrielle Union and more.\n\nThe movement was actually created 10 years ago by black female activist Tarana Burke. She told Ebony she came up with it in 2007 to let young women of color who survive sexual assault know that they are not alone.\n\n'It wasn't built to be a viral campaign or a hashtag that is here today and forgotten tomorrow,' Burke said. 'It was a catchphrase to be used from survivor to survivor to let folks know that they were not alone and that a movement for radical healing was happening and possible.'\n\nThe allegations against Weinstein have also opened up a wider discussion about sexual assault in Hollywood, prompting many stories to surface about other media power players who allegedly assaulted or harassed women, like Bill O'Reilly, Amazon Studios executive Roy Price and director James Toback, as well as in other industries.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/metoo-reaches-85-countries-with-1-7-million-tweets/","None"
"Pope reveals he had weekly psychoanalysis sessions at age 42\nFrancis says he visited psychoanalyst for six months ‘to clarify a few things’ and that now nothing frightens him\n\nPope Francis has revealed that he sought the help of a psychoanalyst for six months when he was 42 and the leader of the Jesuit order in Argentina during the country’s military dictatorship.\n\n\n\nThe pope’s disclosure was made in a book based on 12 in-depth interviews with the French sociologist Dominique Wolton, to be published next week.\n\n\n\nFrancis said the weekly sessions with the psychoanalyst helped him a lot. “For six months, I went to her home once a week to clarify a few things. She was a doctor and psychoanalyst. She was always there,” he told Wolton for the 432-page book Pope Francis: Politics and Society.\n\nPope's psychoanalyst visits show his struggle in Argentina's 'dirty war' Read more\n\n“Then one day, before she died, she called me. Not to receive the sacraments – because she was Jewish – but for a spiritual dialogue. She was a good person.”\n\n\n\nFrancis told Wolton he now felt free. “Of course, I’m in a cage at the Vatican, but not spiritually. Nothing frightens me,” he said.\n\nThe pope also took aim at priests who were “rigid and afraid to communicate”.\n\nThe disclosure came when Francis was discussing the role and influence of the “courageous” women in his life, including his mother, his two grandmothers and Esther Ballestrino de Careaga, the communist founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo movement in Buenos Aires, who was killed during the dictatorship.\n\n\n\nHe also spoke of childhood sweethearts and adolescent girlfriends, saying his relationships with women had enriched his life. “I thank God for having known these true women in my life,” the pope told Wolton. “[Women see things differently from men] and it is important to listen to both.”\n\nThe Jesuit tradition is known to value psychoanalysis, with many regarding self-awareness and introspection as being complementary to spirituality.\n\n\n\nPope Francis: prioritise migrants' dignity over national security Read more\n\nRobert Mickens, the Rome-based editor of the English-language edition of Catholic daily newspaper La Croix, said Francis had previously acknowledged that social sciences could benefit human development.\n\n\n\n“There has been a gradual shift in attitudes within the Catholic church towards psychotherapy since the 1970s,” Mickens said. “It’s very common in priest formation programmes, especially in the western world, for them to undergo a psychological evaluation before admission to a seminary or diocese. There’s a recognition that social sciences can help unearth issues that need to be dealt with.”\n\n\n\nThe pope’s “eye-popping” disclosures could challenge the perception among some people that those who sought treatment were weak, he said.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, the Vatican issued guidelines on the use of psychology in the training of priests. “In some cases, recourse to experts in the psychological sciences can be useful,” the paper said.\n\nAmong candidates for the priesthood “can be found some who come from particular experiences – human, family, professional, intellectual or affective – which, in various ways, have left psychological wounds that are not yet healed and that cause disturbances,” the guidelines said.\n\n“These wounds, unknown to the candidate in their real effects, are often erroneously attributed by him to causes outside himself, thus depriving him of the possibility of facing them adequately.”\n\nAt the time of his sessions in 1978 or 1979, tensions over the leadership of Jorge Bergoglio, as Pope Francis was then known, were high among Argentina’s Jesuits.\n\n\n\nHe had earlier been accused of effectively delivering two fellow priests to the military authorities in 1976, when he refused to publicly endorse their controversial social work in the slums of Buenos Aires.\n\n\n\nArgentina’s “dirty war” was over by the time of Bergoglio’s psychotherapy, but the military dictatorship was still in place.\n\nHowever, there was continuing controversy over his divisive leadership. During his six years as provincial superior from 1973 to 1979, he upset some people with his determination to impose a fresh direction and purpose.\n\n“It’s hard to know exactly what took him to seek psychotherapy – perhaps issues which had come to the fore as leader of the Jesuits,” said Austen Ivereigh, the author of The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope.\n\n“It was certainly a tense time both nationally and internationally [for Jesuits], adding to what had been a difficult, although very successful, period for Bergoglio. He had gallstones soon after, which suggests a level of stress.\n\n“But maybe he just wanted to take the time to take stock. Jesuits are not afraid of seeking professional help when they need it and see psychotherapy as complementary to spirituality. I think this revelation only adds to our already very human picture of a remarkable man.”\n\nThere are more psychologists per capita in Argentina than any other country in the world, according to researcher Modesto Alonso. In 2011, there were 196 psychologists for every 100,000 people compared with about 27 per 100,000 in the US.\n\nIn his conversations with Wolton, Francis said European countries exploited Africa in the colonial era, and although Europe had “important Christian roots … they are not the only ones. There are others that cannot be denied.”\n\n\n\nAbortion, he said, was a “grave sin, it’s the murder of an innocent”. And while he insisted marriage was between a man and a woman, saying “we cannot change it, this is the nature of things,” the pope acknowledged the existence of same-sex civil unions.\n\nWolton’s book is published next Wednesday as Francis begins a six-day visit to Colombia, the first visit by a pope in more than 30 years. The South American country is bitterly divided over a peace deal ending a 50-year war between the government and rebel guerrilla forces, Farc, which has claimed an estimated 220,000 lives and displaced millions.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/pope-francis-psychoanalysis","1504238400.0"

Protests have even been held in Qom, a holy city home to powerful clerics.\n\nThere is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted 'not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran', a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues.\n\nOther demonstrators chanted 'leave Syria, think about us' in videos posted online.

"‘Final act of bravery’: Men who were fatally stabbed trying to stop anti-Muslim rants identified\nTwo men were stabbed to death in Portland, Ore., on Friday when they tried to stop their attacker from harassing two women because they appeared to be Muslim, according to police. (Reuters)\n\nTwo men were stabbed to death and one injured Friday on a light-rail train in Portland, Ore., after they tried to intervene when another passenger began “ranting and raving” and shouting anti-Muslim hate speech at two young women, police said.\n\nPortland police on Saturday identified the two slain victims as 53-year-old Ricky John Best and 23-year-old Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche.\n\nA third victim, 21-year-old Micah David-Cole Fletcher, is being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\n\nAccording to witnesses, a white male passenger riding an eastbound MAX train early Friday afternoon began yelling what “would best be characterized as hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions,” police said. Some of the slurs were directed at two female passengers, one of whom was wearing a hijab, according to police.\n\n“This suspect was on the train and he was yelling and ranting and raving a lot of different things, including what we characterized at hate speech or biased language,” Portland police spokesman Pete Simpson said at a news conference Friday evening.\n\nAt least two men tried to calm the ranting passenger down, but “they were attacked viciously by the suspect” when they did, Simpson said.\n\n“It appears preliminarily that the victims — at least a couple of them — were trying to intervene in his behavior, deescalate him and protect some other people on the train when [the suspect] viciously attacked them,” Simpson said.\n\n\n\nTaliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche (Courtesy Vajra Alaya-Maitreya)\n\nAbout 4:30 p.m. Friday, police responded to calls of a disturbance at the Hollywood Transit Station in east Portland. There, they found three stabbing victims, all adult men. Despite attempted lifesaving measures, Best, a resident of Happy Valley, Ore., was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.\n\nNamkai Meche, of southeast Portland, died at a local hospital; Fletcher, of southeast Portland, is expected to survive, police said Saturday.\n\nThe Oregon State Medical Examiner is conducting autopsies on Best and Namkai Meche and expected to release results late Saturday afternoon, according to police.\n\nBased on witnesses’ statements, officers on Friday were able to locate and arrest the suspect, who had fled the train on foot.\n\nPolice identified the suspect early Saturday morning as 35-year-old Jeremy Joseph Christian, of north Portland. Christian is being held without bail on two counts of aggravated murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of intimidation in the second degree and one count of possession of a restricted weapon as a felon.\n\nJeremy Joseph Christian (Courtesy Portland Police Bureau)\n\nThe stabbing attack shocked the city.\n\n“It’s horrific. There’s no other word to describe what happened today,” Simpson said Friday. “It is simply horrible.”\n\n[‘Brave and selfless’ Oregon stabbing victims hailed as heroes for standing up to racist rants]\n\nThe attack shut down the Hollywood Transit Station and Portland MAX trains in both directions for several hours Friday evening.\n\nSimpson noted then that several passengers, including the two young women thought to be the target of the man’s anti-Muslim slurs, had left the train after the stabbings. He urged any witnesses to come forward to give statements to police. Simpson added that it did not appear that the suspect or the victims had any relationship with one another.\n\n“We don’t know if (the suspect) has mental-health issues or was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or all of the above,” Simpson said. “With this incident, we’re obviously in early stages of the investigation.”\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the FBI and U.S. Attorney for Oregon will work with Portland police on the case. The FBI said it’s too early to say whether the killings qualify as a federal hate crime but U.S. Attorney Billy Williams said Saturday, “There’s a day of reckoning coming, a day of accountability,” the AP reported.\n\nThe attacks occurred just as Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, was set to commence at sunset Friday. Simpson said that Portland police had already reached out to Muslim organizations, mosques and imams in the community to talk about extra patrols during Ramadan — and that those extra patrols would continue.\n\n“Our thoughts are with the Muslim community,” Simpson said Friday. “As something like this happens, this only instills fear in that community.”\n\n[Suspected attacker Jeremy Joseph Christian stood out amid rising tensions in Portland]\n\nOn Saturday, people mourned the stabbing victims and praised them as heroes for their actions. Namkai Meche’s sister, Vajra Alaya-Maitreya, emailed a statement to The Washington Post on behalf of their family, saying her brother lived “a joyous and full life” with an enthusiasm that was infectious.\n\n“We lost him in a senseless act that brought close to home the insidious rift of prejudice and intolerance that is too familiar, too common. He was resolute in his conduct (and) respect of all people,” she wrote. “In his final act of bravery, he held true to what he believed is the way forward. He will live in our hearts forever as the just, brave, loving, hilarious and beautiful soul he was. We ask that in honor of his memory, we use this tragedy as an opportunity for reflection and change. We choose love.”\n\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler on Saturday said, “Their actions were brave and selfless and should serve as an example, an inspiration to us all,” the AP reported.\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, a GoFundMe campaign called “Tri Met Heroes” set up for the victims’ families had raised more than $30,000. A GoFundMe spokesman confirmed to The Post that the company would ensure funds are sent to the victim’s families.\n\nThe attack prompted a slew of outraged responses Friday from Oregon residents and lawmakers, as well as nationally.\n\nTerrible tragedy on Portland's Max Train.

And, unfortunately, the easy targets are women because of the headscarf.”\n\nThe Portland Mercury, a local newspaper, reported that Christian was a “known right wing extremist and white supremacist” who had attempted to assault protesters at local demonstrations in the past. Video from April 29, shot by Mercury reporter Doug Brown, showed Christian arriving at a “March for Free Speech” draped in an American flag and carrying a baseball bat.

The attack was conducted using a Yemeni-made, long-range missile called the Burqan 2H, it said.\n\nThe Riyadh airport tweeted that it hadn't been affected.\n\n'Travelers across King Khalid international airport in Riyadh, we assure you that the movement is going on as normal and usual, and trips going according to time,' the airport said on Twitter.\n\nAirstrikes later in the day targeted Yemen's capital Sanaa, shaking homes and breaking windows. This is the first night attack on Sanaa in weeks, according to CNN's Hakim al-Masmari from Sanaa.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been leading a coalition of states against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who toppled Yemen's internationally recognized government in 2015.\n\nThe missile launch on King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh was the first time the heart of the Saudi capital has been attacked and represents a major escalation of the ongoing war in the region.\n\nNo injuries\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition accused a regional state of providing material support to the Houthi rebels, saying the firing of a ballistic missile at Riyadh 'threatens the security of the Kingdom and regional and international security,' according to a statement carried by Saudi state-TV al-Ekbariya.\n\nThe coalition didn't name the country. Saudi Arabia has been fighting a proxy war in Yemen against Iran, which it accuses of arming the Houthi rebels. Saudi Arabia has led a military operation in Yemen in support of the internationally recognized government, which was driven out of the capital by the Shiite Houthi rebels and is now based in the southern city of Aden.\n\n'This hostile and random act by the Houthis proves that one of the terrorism-supporting countries in the region supports the Houthis,' the statement said.\n\nThe missile was fired at 8:07 p.m. local time (1:07 p.m. ET) and targeted civilian areas in Riyadh, the coalition said. It was intercepted by the Patriot missile defense system, leading to shrapnel falling over an uninhabited area east of the airport, the statement said.\n\nThere were no injuries, it said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump praised the US-made Patriot missile defense system.\n\n'We make the best military equipment in the world,' he said. '... You saw the missile that went out? And our system knocked the missile out of the air. That's how good we are. Nobody makes what we make, and now we're selling it all over the world,' Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One en route to Japan.\n\n'New phase'\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office has documented 13,829 civilian casualties in Yemen, including 5,110 people killed, from the beginning of the fighting into late August.\n\nAn airstrike in Sanaa in August destroyed two residential buildings, which a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition said was an 'unintentional accident.' An airstrike days earlier destroyed a hotel on the outskirts of Sanaa, leaving dozens dead.\n\n'We previously warned that capitals of countries attacking Yemen will not be safe from our ballistic missiles,' Houthi spokesman Mohammed AbdulSalam said. 'Today's missile attack comes in response to Saudi killing innocent Yemeni civilians.'\n\nA senior Yemeni air force official told CNN that the claim that Saudi Arabia intercepted the ballistic missile is false.\n\n'The Saudi regime cannot hide the heavy fires that was seen by thousands of Saudi nationals in the King Khalid Airport premises as result of the Yemeni missile,' the official said.\n\n'This is not the end. Saudi cities will be a continuous target. We are entering a new phase,' he said.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/04/middleeast/saudi-arabia-ballistic-missile/index.html","1509768000.0"
"South Korea Removes President Park Geun-hye\nEight justices of the Constitutional Court unanimously decided to unseat Ms. Park for committing “acts that violated the Constitution and laws” throughout her time in office, Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said in a ruling that was nationally broadcast.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Park’s acts “betrayed the trust of the people and were of the kind that cannot be tolerated for the sake of protecting the Constitution,” Justice Lee said.\n\nAs the verdict was announced, silence fell over thousands of Park supporters who rallied near the courthouse waving South Korean flags. Soon, they tried to march on the court and called for “destroying” it. When the police blocked them, some of the mostly elderly protesters attacked the officers with flagpoles, hurling water bottles and pieces of the sidewalk pavement. Two pro-Park demonstrators, ages 60 and 72, died during the unrest.\n\nMs. Park did not comment on the ruling, and remained in the presidential palace after her removal from power. But In Myung-jin, the leader of Ms. Park’s conservative Liberty Korea Party, said he “humbly respected” the ruling.\n\nWith the immunity conferred by her office now gone, Ms. Park, 65, faces prosecutors seeking to charge her with bribery, extortion and abuse of power in connection with allegations of conspiring with a confidante, her childhood friend Choi Soon-sil, to collect tens of millions of dollars in bribes from companies like Samsung.\n\nBy law, the country must elect a new president within 60 days. The acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, an ally of Ms. Park’s, will remain in office in the interim. The Trump administration is rushing a missile defense system to South Korea so that it can be in place before the election.\n\nAfter the ruling, Mr. Hwang called key Cabinet ministers to put the nation on a heightened state of military readiness, saying the lack of a president represented a national “emergency.” He also warned North Korea against making “additional provocations.”\n\nPhoto\n\nThe last time a South Korean leader was removed from office under popular pressure was in 1960, when the police fired on crowds calling for President Syngman Rhee to step down. (Mr. Rhee, a dictator, fled into exile in Hawaii and died there.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a sign of how far South Korea’s young democracy has evolved, Ms. Park was removed without any violence, after large, peaceful protests in recent months demanding that she step down. In addition to the swell of popular anger, the legislature and the judiciary — two institutions that have been weaker than the presidency historically — were crucial to the outcome.\n\n“This is a miracle, a new milestone in the strengthening and institutionalizing of democracy in South Korea,” said Kang Won-taek, a political scientist at Seoul National University.\n\nWhen crowds took to the streets, they were not just seeking to remove a leader who had one year left in office. They were also rebelling against a political order that had held South Korea together for decades but is now fracturing under pressures both at home and abroad, analysts said.\n\nMs. Park’s father ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979. He founded its economic growth model, which transformed the nation into an export powerhouse and allowed the emergence of family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol that benefited from tax cuts and anti-labor policies.\n\nMs. Park was elected in 2012 with the support of older conservative South Koreans who revered her father for the country’s breakneck economic growth.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the nexus of industry and political power gave rise to collusive ties, highlighted by the scandal that led to Ms. Park’s fall.\n\nThe scandal also swept up the de facto head of Samsung, Lee Jae-yong, who was indicted on charges of bribing Ms. Park and her confidante, Ms. Choi.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSamsung, the nation’s largest conglomerate, has been tainted by corruption before. But the company has been considered too important to the economy for any of its top leaders to spend time behind bars — until now. The jailing of Mr. Lee, who is facing trial, is another potent sign that the old order is not holding.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They also promised to stop chaebol chairmen from helping their children amass fortunes through dubious means, like forcing their companies to do exclusive business with the children’s businesses.\n\nWith the conservatives discredited — and no leading conservative candidate to succeed Ms. Park — the left could take power for the first time in a decade. The dominant campaign issues will probably be North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and South Korea’s relations with the United States and China.\n\nIf the opposition takes power, it may try to revive its old “sunshine policy” of building ties with North Korea through aid and exchanges, an approach favored by China. That would complicate Washington’s efforts to isolate the North at a time other Asian nations like the Philippines are gravitating toward Beijing.\n\nPhoto\n\nMoon Jae-in, the Democratic Party leader who is leading in opinion surveys, has said that a decade of applying sanctions on North Korea had failed to stop its nuclear weapons programs. He has said that sanctions are necessary, but that “their goal should be to draw North Korea back to the negotiating table.”\n\nHe believes that Ms. Park’s decision to allow the deployment of the American missile defense system — known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad — has dragged the country into the dangerous and growing rivalry between Washington and Beijing; China has called the system a threat to its security and taken steps to punish South Korea economically for accepting it.\n\nConservative South Koreans see the deployment of the antimissile system not only as a guard against the North but also as a symbolic reaffirmation of the all-important alliance with the United States. Mr. Moon’s party demands that the deployment, which began this week, be suspended immediately. If it takes power, it says it will review the deployment of the antimissile system to determine if it is in South Korea’s best interest.\n\nAs South Korea has learned, it cannot always keep Washington and Beijing happy at the same time, as in the case of the country’s decision to accept the American missile defenses.\n\nYet Ms. Park’s impeachment was also a pushback against “Cold War conservatives” like her father, who seized on Communist threats from North Korea to hide their corruption and silence political opponents, said Kim Dong-choon, a sociologist at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Park’s father tortured and executed dissidents, framing them with spying charges. Now, his daughter faces charges that her government blacklisted thousands of unfriendly artists and writers.\n\n“Her removal means that the curtain is finally drawing on the authoritarian political and economic order that has dominated South Korea for decades,” said Ahn Byong-jin, rector of the Global Academy for Future Civilizations at Kyung Hee University in Seoul.\n\nAnalysts cautioned that political and economic change will come slowly.\n\nAs Mr. Moon put it recently: “We need a national cleanup. We need to liquidate the old system and build a new South Korea. Only then can we complete the revolution started by the people who rallied with candlelight.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/world/asia/park-geun-hye-impeached-south-korea.html","1489035600.0"
"Comey drafted conclusion in Hillary Clinton probe before key interviews, top Republicans say\nFired FBI Director James Comey drafted a statement to announce the conclusion in the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server before the FBI interviewed key witnesses, including Hillary Clinton herself, top Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee claim.\n\nCommittee chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, reached that conclusion from transcripts of interviews with people close to Comey and provided by the Department of Justice's Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Those transcripts, the Republicans said in a Thursday letter to current FBI Director Chris Wray, show Comey had already drafted a conclusion for his investigation before interviewing 17 key witnesses, including Clinton, and before the DOJ had reached immunity agreements with former Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson.\n\nComey's sudden July 5 announcement that there would be no charges in the Clinton investigation -- despite his sharp criticisms of the former presidential candidate -- threw a wrench in an already-tumultuous election cycle.\n\n'Conclusion first, fact-gathering second—that's no way to run an investigation,' the senators said in their letter to Wray. 'The FBI should be held to a higher standard than that, especially in a matter of such great public interest and controversy.'\n\nThe letter said OSC attorneys interviewed James Rybicki, Comey's chief of staff, and Trisha Anderson, the Principal Deputy General Counsel of National Security and Cyberlaw, as a part of an investigation into whether Comey's July 5 announcement violated the Hatch Act governing government officials' political activity. OSC dropped the probe when Comey was fired. The Republicans' letter included parts of the texts of the transcripts.\n\nOne portion of the transcript from an unnamed interviewee reads as follows:\n\n'The idea, I'm not entirely sure exactly when the idea of the public statement um first emerged,' the interviewee said. 'Um it was, I just, I can't put a precise timeframe on it um but [redaction]. And then I believe it was in early May of 2016 that the director himself wrote a draft of that statement …'\n\nThe FBI didn't interview Clinton until July 2, three days before Comey went on national television to announce there would be no charges against Clinton.\n\nGrassley and Graham asked Wray for all drafts of Comey's statement about the Clinton email probe, as well as all communications about the statement within the FBI.\n\nThe FBI gave CBS News the following comment:\n\n'We received the letter. In keeping with our normal process, any response will be provided to the members of Congress who made the request.'\n\nThe DOJ's Office of Inspector General is independently investigating Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation.\n\nThe White House originally said President Trump fired Comey over his mishandling of the Clinton email investigation, although Mr. Trump told NBC News that when he decided to fire Comey, he thought of the 'made-up' Russia story about any ties between him and Russia.\n\nCBS News' Andy Triay contributed to this report.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/comey-drafted-conclusion-clinton-probe-before-key-interviews-top-republicans-say/","None"
"Extreme poverty in America: read the UN special monitor's report\nI have spent the past two weeks visiting the United States, at the invitation of the federal government, to look at whether the persistence of extreme poverty in America undermines the enjoyment of human rights by its citizens. In my travels through California, Alabama, Georgia, Puerto Rico, West Virginia, and Washington DC I have spoken with dozens of experts and civil society groups, met with senior state and federal government officials and talked with many people who are homeless or living in deep poverty. I am grateful to the Trump administration for facilitating my visit and for its continuing cooperation with the UN Human Rights Council’s accountability mechanisms that apply to all states.\n\n\n\nA journey through a land of extreme poverty: welcome to America Read more\n\nMy visit coincides with a dramatic change of direction in US policies relating to inequality and extreme poverty. The proposed tax reform package stakes out America’s bid to become the most unequal society in the world, and will greatly increase the already high levels of wealth and income inequality between the richest 1% and the poorest 50% of Americans. The dramatic cuts in welfare, foreshadowed by Donald Trump and speaker Ryan, and already beginning to be implemented by the administration, will essentially shred crucial dimensions of a safety net that is already full of holes. It is against this background that my report is presented.\n\nThe United States is one of the world’s richest and most powerful and technologically innovative countries; but neither its wealth nor its power nor its technology is being harnessed to address the situation in which 40 million people continue to live in poverty.\n\nI have seen and heard a lot over the past two weeks. I met with many people barely surviving on Skid Row in Los Angeles, I witnessed a San Francisco police officer telling a group of homeless people to move on but having no answer when asked where they could move to, I heard how thousands of poor people get minor infraction notices which seem to be intentionally designed to quickly explode into unpayable debt, incarceration, and the replenishment of municipal coffers, I saw sewage-filled yards in states where governments don’t consider sanitation facilities to be their responsibility, I saw people who had lost all of their teeth because adult dental care is not covered by the vast majority of programs available to the very poor, I heard about soaring death rates and family and community destruction wrought by opioids, and I met with people in Puerto Rico living next to a mountain of completely unprotected coal ash which rains down upon them, bringing illness, disability and death.\n\nOf course, that is not the whole story. I also saw much that is positive. I met with state and especially municipal officials who are determined to improve social protection for the poorest 20% of their communities, I saw an energized civil society in many places, I visited a Catholic Church in San Francisco (St Boniface – the Gubbio Project) that opens its pews to the homeless every day between services, I saw extraordinary resilience and community solidarity in Puerto Rico, I toured an amazing community health initiative in Charleston, West Virginia that serves 21,000 patients with free medical, dental, pharmaceutical and other services, overseen by local volunteer physicians, dentists and others (Health Right), and indigenous communities presenting at a US-Human Rights Network conference in Atlanta lauded Alaska’s advanced health care system for indigenous peoples, designed with direct participation of the target group.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism was a constant theme in my conversations. But instead of realizing its founders’ admirable commitments, today’s United States has proved itself to be exceptional in far more problematic ways that are shockingly at odds with its immense wealth and its founding commitment to human rights. As a result, contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound.\n\nIn talking with people in the different states and territories I was frequently asked how the US compares with other states. While such comparisons are not always perfect, a cross-section of statistical comparisons provides a relatively clear picture of the contrast between the wealth, innovative capacity, and work ethic of the US, and the social and other outcomes that have been attained.\n\nHookworm, a disease of extreme poverty, is thriving in the US south. Why? Read more\n\nBy most indicators, the US is one of the world’s wealthiest countries. It spends more on national defense than China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Kingdom, India, France and Japan combined.\n\nUS healthcare expenditures per capita are double the OECD average and much higher than in all other countries. But there are many fewer doctors and hospital beds per person than the OECD average.\n\nUS infant mortality rates in 2013 were the highest in the developed world.\n\nAmericans can expect to live shorter and sicker lives, compared to people living in any other rich democracy, and the “health gap” between the US and its peer countries continues to grow.\n\nUS inequality levels are far higher than those in most European countries\n\nNeglected tropical diseases, including Zika, are increasingly common in the USA. It has been estimated that 12 million Americans live with a neglected parasitic infection. A 2017 report documents the prevalence of hookworm in Lowndes County, Alabama.\n\nThe US has the highest prevalence of obesity in the developed world.\n\nIn terms of access to water and sanitation the US ranks 36th in the world.\n\nAmerica has the highest incarceration rate in the world, ahead of Turkmenistan, El Salvador, Cuba, Thailand and the Russian Federation. Its rate is nearly five times the OECD average.\n\nThe youth poverty rate in the United States is the highest across the OECD with one quarter of youth living in poverty compared to less than 14% across the OECD.\n\nThe Stanford Center on Inequality and Poverty ranks the most well-off countries in terms of labor markets, poverty, safety net, wealth inequality, and economic mobility. The US comes in last of the top 10 most well-off countries, and 18th amongst the top 21.\n\nIn the OECD the US ranks 35th out of 37 in terms of poverty and inequality.\n\nAccording to the World Income Inequality Database, the US has the highest Gini rate (measuring inequality) of all Western Countries\n\nThe Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality characterizes the US as “a clear and constant outlier in the child poverty league”. US child poverty rates are the highest amongst the six richest countries – Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and Norway.\n\nTo read to full report, click here.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/extreme-poverty-america-un-special-monitor-report","1513314000.0"

"U.S. warns Iran 'the world is watching' as new protests challenge regime\nThe protests continued for a third day on Saturday and spread to Tehran, where they seemed smaller and more contained with an increasingly large security apparatus present.\n\nMuch of the crowds' anger appeared to be focused on a stagnant economy, alleged corruption and Iran's costly involvement in regional conflicts such as those in Syria and Lebanon.\n\nEarlier Saturday, hard-liners rallied across the country to support Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and others. The rallies, scheduled weeks earlier, commemorated a mass 2009 pro-government rally challenging those who rejected the re-election of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad amid fraud allegations.\n\nIranian protesters chant slogans at a rally in Tehran, Iran on Dec. 30, 2017. Ebrahim Noroozi / AP\n\nIn Tehran, some 4,000 people gathered in support of the regime.\n\nHowever, information about the dueling demonstrations remains scarce as both state-run and semi-official media in Iran have not widely reported on the economic protests.\n\nRelated: Missile fired at palace highlights ratcheting Saudi-Iran tensions\n\nState TV aired its first reports on the protests Saturday, acknowledging some protesters chanted the name of Iran's one-time shah, who fled into exile just before its 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nIt's unclear what effect Trump's support for the economic protests would have. Iranians are already largely skeptical of him over his refusal to re-certify the 2015 nuclear deal, while Iran's government has often used comments by U.S. officials to dismiss protests as a sign of foreign interference in its internal politics.\n\n'Counterrevolution groups and foreign media are continuing their organized efforts to misuse the people's economic and livelihood problems and their legitimate demands to provide an opportunity for unlawful gatherings and possibly chaos,' state TV said Saturday.\n\nWithin Iran’s splintered political system, different factions held each other accountable with hard-liners blaming Rouhani and reformists blaming hard-liners.

"Nuclear accident sends 'harmless' radioactive cloud over Europe\nA cloud of radioactive pollution over Europe in recent weeks indicates that an accident happened in a nuclear facility in Russia or Kazakhstan in the last week of September, the French nuclear safety institute IRSN has said.\n\n\n\nThe IRSN on Thursday ruled out an accident in a nuclear reactor, saying it was likely to be in a nuclear fuel treatment site or centre for radioactive medicine. There has been no impact on human health or the environment in Europe, it said.\n\nIRSN, the technical arm of French nuclear regulator ASN, said in a statement it could not pinpoint the location of the release of radioactive material but that based on weather patterns, the most plausible zone lay south of the Ural mountains, between the Urals and the Volga river.\n\nThis could indicate Russia or possibly Kazakhstan, an IRSN official said.\n\nFukushima residents win 500m yen payout over nuclear disaster Read more\n\n“Russian authorities have said they are not aware of an accident on their territory,” IRSN director Jean-Marc Peres told Reuters. He added that the institute had not yet been in contact with Kazakh authorities.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Russian emergencies ministry said she could not immediately comment. It was not immediately possible to reach authorities in Kazakhstan or the Kazakh embassy in Moscow.\n\nPeres said that in recent weeks IRSN and several other nuclear safety institutes in Europe had measured high levels of ruthenium-106, a radioactive nuclide that is the product of splitting atoms in a reactor and does not occur naturally.\n\nIRSN estimates a significant quantity of ruthenium-106 was released, between 100 and 300 terabecquerels, and that if an accident of this magnitude had happened in France it would have required the evacuation or sheltering of people in a radius of several kilometres around the accident site.\n\nThe ruthenium-106 was probably released in a nuclear fuel treatment site or centre for radioactive medicine, Peres said. Because of its short half-life of about a year, ruthenium-106 is used in nuclear medicine – for example in cancer therapy for eye tumours – but can also be released when nuclear fuel is reprocessed.\n\nJean-Christophe Gariel, director for health at the IRSN, said the responsibility for identifying the source of the nuclear cloud was now with the Russians or Kazakhs. If they failed to identify where the contamination had come from, the matter could be referred to the United Nations, he said.\n\n“The matter is closed as far as France is concerned. It’s not a problem for France, what is not satisfactory is that ruthenium-106 has been detected across Europe and that poses a question,” Gariel told the Guardian.\n\n\n\nGariel confirmed the IRSN’s conclusion that the radioactive pollution had no detrimental consequences of human health or the environment in Europe, and said he had spoken directly to Russian colleagues.\n\n\n\n“We have come up with a plausible zone of where it could have come from; we can’t do any more. Russia is a vast country and we’re not aware of all the installations on its territory. The ball is now in the other camp.”\n\nHe added: “I have spoken to my Russian counterparts; these are people we know and they have told me in all honesty they have had no reporting of an accident.”\n\nThe IRSN ruled out an accident in a nuclear reactor, as that would have led to contamination with other substances. It also ruled out the crash of a ruthenium-powered satellite as an investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency has concluded that no ruthenium-containing satellite has fallen back on Earth during this period.\n\nMeasurement from European stations showed relatively high levels of ruthenium-106 in the atmosphere of the majority of European countries at the beginning of October, with a steady decrease from 6 October onwards. The radioactive element has not been detected in France since 13 October.\n\nDuncan Cox, leader of Public Health England’s radiation emergency response group, said: “Radiation monitors at our sites in Oxfordshire and Glasgow have been checked since September when this substance was reported by other European radiation monitoring institutes, and we have not detected any unusual sources of radiation.”\n\nMonitoring stations in Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland all detected very low levels of ruthenium-106 from late September. Seven German stations recorded levels from a few microbecquerels to five millibecquerels per cubic metre of air, posing no hazard to health.\n\nThe French institute also said that the probability of importation into France of foodstuffs, notably mushrooms, contaminated by ruthenium-106 near the site of the accident is extremely low.\n\nReuters contributed to this report","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/10/nuclear-accident-in-russia-or-kazakhstan-sends-radioactive-cloud-over-europe","1510290000.0"
"Dictionary.com chooses 'complicit' as its word of the year\nNEW YORK -- Russian election influence, the ever-widening sexual harassment scandal, mass shootings and the opioid epidemic helped elevate the word 'complicit' as Dictionary.com's word of the year for 2017.\n\nLook-ups of the word increased nearly 300 percent over last year as 'complicit' hit just about every hot button from politics to natural disasters, lexicographer Jane Solomon told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's formal announcement of the site's pick.\n\n'This year a conversation that keeps on surfacing is what exactly it means to be complicit,' she said. 'Complicit has sprung up in conversations about those who speak out against powerful figures in institutions, and those who stay silent.'\n\nThe first of three major spikes for the word struck March 12. That was the day after 'Saturday Night Live' aired a sketch starring Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump in a glittery gold dress peddling a fragrance called 'Complicit' because: 'She's beautiful, she's powerful, she's complicit.'\n\nThe bump was followed by another April 5, also related to Trump, Solomon said. It was the day she appeared on 'CBS This Morning,' where co-host Gayle King asked her, among other things, about the sketch and stories that she and her husband, Jared Kushner, were complicit in White House actions.\n\n'If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I'm complicit,' Trump said. 'I don't know that the critics who may say that of me, if they found themselves in this very unique and unprecedented situation that I am now in, would do any differently than I'm doing. So I hope to make a positive impact.\n\n'I don't know what it means to be complicit, but, you know, I hope time will prove that I have done a good job and, much more importantly, that my father's administration is the success that I know it will be.'\n\nAnother major spike occurred Oct. 24, the day Arizona Republican Jeff Flake announced from the Senate floor that he would not seek re-election, harshly criticizing President Trump and urging other members of the party not to stand silently with the president.\n\n'I have children and grandchildren to answer to, and so, Mr. President, I will not be complicit,' Flake said.\n\nSolomon noted that neither she nor Dictionary.com can know what sends people to dictionaries or dictionary sites to look up 'complicit' or any other word. She and other lexicographers who study look-up behavior believe it's likely a combination of people who may not know a definition, are digging deeper or are seeking inspiration or emotional reinforcement of some sort.\n\nAs for 'complicit,' she said several other major events contributed to interest in the word. They include the rise of the opioid epidemic and how it came to pass, along with the spread of sexual harassment and assault allegations against an ever-growing list of powerful men, including film mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThe scandal that started in Hollywood and quickly spread across industries has led to a mountain of questions over who knew what, who might have contributed and what it means to stay silent.\n\nWhile Solomon shared percentage increases for 'complicit,' the company would not disclose the number of look-ups, calling that data proprietary.\n\nThe site chooses its word of the year by heading straight for data first, scouring look-ups by day, month and year to date and how they correspond to noteworthy events, Solomon said. This year, a lot of high-volume trends unsurprisingly corresponded to politics. But the site also looks at lower-volume trends to see what other words resonated.

"AfD leader quits party caucus hours after German election breakthrough\nFrauke Petry ‘drops bomb’ on rightwing nationalist party by announcing she will instead serve as independent MP\n\nGermany’s rightwing nationalist party Alternative für Deutschland, in celebratory mode after coming third in elections, was delivered a bombshell by its co-leader when she announced she would not sit with the party in the Bundestag.\n\n\n\nWhat the stunning success of AfD means for Germany and Europe | Cas Mudde Read more\n\nFrauke Petry walked out of a press conference on Monday morning at which the party leadership marvelled at its success, having secured nearly 13% of the vote and 94 seats in the federal parliament.\n\nThe departure of one of the AfD’s most prominent figures illustrates the splits in the party despite its attempts to show a united front during the election campaign.\n\nPetry, who was on the moderate wing of the party, saw her role as that of uniting the AfD. But she has earned scorn from emboldened rightwing nationalists who have increasingly sidelined their opponents.\n\n\n\nIn April, she attempted to lead the party towards what she called a more realistic and pragmatic approach, so that, she said, it would have a chance to enter coalition governments.\n\nBut her co-leader, Jörg Meuthen, and the party’s leading election candidates, Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, rejected her stance, arguing the party’s goal should be to act as a strong opposition in the Bundestag to the politics of Angela Merkel, the chancellor.\n\nShortly after the packed press conference opened in Berlin, Petry said “after a long period of contemplation” she would not join the party in the Bundestag and would instead serve as an independent MP for her constituency in Saxony, where she narrowly beat the Christian Democrats.\n\nShe stood up and walked out with a smile, leaving her party colleagues looking stunned and prompting gasps from the press corps. Meuthen accused Petry of “dropping a bomb”, adding: “That was not discussed with us in advance. We knew nothing about it”.\n\nWeidel said Petry’s walkout was “hard to beat in terms of irresponsibility”, and urged her to leave the party altogether “to prevent further harm”.\n\nHours later there were further signs of discord when four AfD MPs in the regional government in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern announced they too were leaving their own parliamentary group. A spokesman for the group said the differences between the outgoing members and the remaining ones were glaring.\n\n“The AfD group has been dysfunctional for a long time,” the spokesman said. “Now it’s time to take the appropriate steps due to the political differences,” he said, adding that the dissenters were due to form their own parliamentary group.\n\nGermany’s rightwing populists will arrive in the Bundestag with the best result for any new party since 1949, a higher share of the vote than either the Greens or the leftwing Die Linke have achieved in several decades.\n\nIn the states that used to form East Germany, AfD looks likely to become the second-largest party.\n\nFounded by a group of economics professors in protest against Greek bailout programmes, the party morphed into an anti-immigrant force after the refugee crisis in the summer of 2015 when around a million refugees arrived in Germany after Merkel said they were to be allowed in. The party has successfully cashed in on fears related to the arrivals, including security and loss of identity.\n\nThe AfD’s success in the east shows the extent to which it has broadened its appeal and has reached out to those who feel disappointed by their region’s decline after reunification.\n\nThe AfD is by no means only a party of the “left-behinds” and its agenda continues to be set by western politicians advocating conventional small-state economics. A survey in June showed that 39% of the party’s supporters have a higher than average income.\n\nThough the nationalist wing may not dominate the AfD’s Bundestag delegation, its aggressive and taboo-breaking rhetoric has been tolerated – and increasingly adopted – by the party leadership.\n\nOn Monday, Gauland said the party would make good on its promise to “hound” Merkel in the Bundestag and would push for a parliamentary investigation to examine the legality of her decisions both to allow refugees into Germany as well as over the Greek bailout.\n\nMerkel, meanwhile, made clear that the AfD would have no influence on Germany’s foreign, European and refugee policies. Asked whether the performance of the AfDwould affect German policy in any way, Merkel replied: “I don’t think so.”\n\n“The parties that are capable of forming coalitions with each other will seek solutions there are of course differences ... but AfD will have no influence.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/afd-leader-frauke-petry-quits-party-german-election-breakthrough","1506312000.0"
"Catalonia referendum: Spain steps up raids to halt vote\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Catalonia's separatist government is defying a Constitutional Court order to halt the 1 October vote\n\nSpanish police have detained 14 Catalan officials and raided regional government ministries involved in organising an independence vote declared illegal by Spain's government.\n\nTensions were already high before Josep Maria Jové, number two in the Catalan vice-presidency, and others were held.\n\nThousands of Catalans took to the streets in protest and the region's president complained of a power grab.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the state had been forced to act.\n\nThe region's separatist government is defying an order by Spain's Constitutional Court to suspend the 1 October referendum law passed by the Catalan parliament last month.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A sea of protesters filled the Gran Via and other streets as police searched the Catalan economy ministry\n\nWednesday's operation targeting over 40 ministries and offices as well as three private companies was a dramatic intensification of Spain's attempt to stop the vote taking place.\n\nAn estimated 10 million ballot papers were found in a warehouse outside Barcelona, reports said.\n\nThere were scattered protests outside a number of buildings, but the biggest was outside the Catalan economy ministry in the heart of Barcelona. Scuffles were reported as police tried to remove documents from the foreign affairs building.\n\nIn a separate move Spain's finance minister, Cristóbal Montoro, announced the national government was now set to take control of the Catalan regional budget, so that the state would pay for essential public services, rather than transfer the money to Barcelona.\n\nAfter an emergency cabinet meeting Catalan President Carles Puigdemont accused the Madrid government of 'de facto' suspending the region's autonomy and imposing a state of emergency.\n\nWhy is Spain cracking down?\n\nEleven days ahead of the planned vote on 1 October, the national government has made its biggest move yet to stop it happening.\n\nSpain did not stop an earlier vote taking place in November 2014, but this time the Catalan leadership plans a declaration of independence within 48 hours of a Yes vote.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Scuffles broke out on Tuesday when demonstrators in Terrassa tried to stop a raid targeting voting material\n\nMr Rajoy said the regional government had been warned that they were destroying Spain's national sovereignty, 'There's no democratic state in the world that would accept what these people are planning,' he said. He urged the Catalan president to comply with the law and put his secessionist challenge into 'reverse gear'.\n\nSeveral ministries in Barcelona were raided on Wednesday, including the economy, foreign affairs, telecoms, social affairs and presidency buildings. Among those detained were officials from the economy ministry, run by Catalan Vice-President Oriol Junqueras, as well as figures from other departments.\n\nThose held are suspected of misappropriating funds for the vote and misusing confidential data on taxpayers.\n\nPolice were searching for computer equipment and any documentation linked to the planned vote. The day before, they seized some 45,000 envelopes with the Catalan government's logo from a private delivery company in Terrassa, north-west of Barcelona.\n\nOn Friday, the Spanish finance minister gave Oriol Junqueras a deadline to call off the vote or see funding for essential services in Catalonia taken over by Madrid. A letter was sent to Mr Junqueras late on Tuesday reminding him the deadline had passed.\n\nA risky escalation\n\nBy James Badcock, BBC News, Madrid\n\nThe spate of raids and arrests in Barcelona is a clear escalation by the Spanish state as it tries to deactivate the planned referendum.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Chanting 'We will vote', protesters blocked the Gran Via in Barcelona outside the Catalan economy ministry\n\nPrevious raids have targeted sites suspected of holding electoral material. Arresting officials from an elected government risks further polarising Catalan society between those who want independence and those who do not.\n\nAlthough the Catalan independence movement has so far been peaceful, raids on government premises carried out by a Spanish militarised police force, the Guardia Civil, create uncomfortable echoes of the Franco dictatorship.\n\nDemonstrators are already taking to the streets to protect their 'right to decide'. And there is a risk of clashes between pro-independence activists and police forces with orders to stop the vote.\n\nHow are Catalan leaders responding?\n\nAs the Catalan president condemned Spain's 'anti-democratic and totalitarian actions', another Catalan leader called for peaceful resistance to protect the buildings as the regional government met in emergency session.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said the Spanish leadership had crossed a red line\n\n'The time has come - let's resist peacefully; let's come out and defend our institutions,' the president of the Catalan National Assembly, Jordi Sánchez, tweeted.\n\nHe did not have to wait long. Protesters gathered outside the economy ministry as the police operation took place, chanting 'We will vote' and surrounding the Guardia Civil cars stationed outside.\n\nThe centre of Barcelona soon became a sea of Catalan flags and the city's renowned football club threw its weight behind the protests, condemning any act that threatened freedom of speech and self-determination.\n\nThe Catalan vice-president accused Spanish police of attacking the region's institutions and therefore its citizens too. 'We will not allow it,' he said.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @AdaColau 1. Faced with the authoritarian turn of the state, Barcelona stands by Catalan institutions and defends Catalan self-rule — Ada Colau (@AdaColau) September 20, 2017 Report\n\nIn Madrid, Catalan separatist MP Gabriel Rufián told the prime minister in parliament he should take his 'dirty hands' off Catalonia's institutions, Efe news agency reported.\n\nBarcelona Mayor Ada Colau warned that if Mr Rajoy 'persists with this repressive strategy, he'll find diverse, pro-Catalan voices more united than ever defending rights and freedom'.\n\nDo Catalans want independence?\n\nSome 7.5 million people live in Spain's well-off north-eastern region and a majority are thought to be in favour of having a vote.

While Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, Catalans argue they pay more into the national budget than they get back.

"Israel backs Hungary, says financier Soros is a threat\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s foreign ministry has issued a statement denouncing U.S. billionaire George Soros, a move that appeared designed to align Israel more closely with Hungary ahead of a visit to Budapest next week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSoros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has repeatedly been targeted by Hungary’s right-wing government, in particular over his support for more open immigration.\n\nIn the latest case, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has backed a campaign in which Soros is singled out as an enemy of the state. “Let’s not allow Soros to have the last laugh” say billboards next to a picture of the 86-year-old investor, a campaign that Jewish groups and others say foments anti-Semitism.\n\nSoros, who rarely addresses personal attacks against him, has not commented on the billboards. But Hungarian Jewish groups and Human Rights Watch, an organization partly funded by Soros, have condemned the campaign, saying it “evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War”.\n\nMany posters have been defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti, including the words “stinking Jew” written in magic marker.\n\nIsrael’s ambassador to Hungary issued a statement denouncing the campaign, saying it “evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear”, an apparent reference to Hungary’s part in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nBut hours after the ambassador made his comments over the weekend, Israel’s foreign ministry issued a “clarification” saying that Soros was a legitimate target for criticism.\n\n“In no way was the statement (by the ambassador) meant to delegitimize criticism of George Soros, who continuously undermines Israel’s democratically elected governments,” said foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon, adding that Soros funded organizations “that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself”.\n\nA spokesman for Soros’s Open Society Foundations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNETANYAHU VISIT\n\nThe foreign ministry’s unusual decision to issue a statement clarifying comments by one of its ambassadors comes days before Netanyahu, who also serves as Israel’s foreign minister, is scheduled to visit Orban.\n\nIsrael is normally quick to denounce anti-Semitism or threats to Jewish communities anywhere in the world. While it made that point in the statement, it chose to focus on the threat it believes Soros poses to Israeli democracy.\n\nAmong the organizations Soros funds is Human Rights Watch, which is frequently critical of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its policies toward the Palestinians.\n\nLike Hungary, Israel has passed legislation that seeks to limit the influence of non-governmental organizations that receive a large portion of their funding from abroad.\n\nIsrael and Hungary were briefly at odds last month after Orban praised Hungary’s World War Two leader Miklos Horthy, calling him an “exceptional statesman”.\n\nHorthy was an ally of Adolf Hitler who approved anti-Jewish legislation in the 1920s and 1930s and cooperated with the Germans in deporting Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust.\n\nInitially Israel expressed alarm, but then quickly accepted the Hungarian government’s explanation that Orban had zero tolerance for anti-Semitism and was not suggesting everything Horthy did was positive.\n\nThe strong ties between Netanyahu and Orban have raised eyebrows in the European Union, where Orban is regarded as an illiberal maverick. His party has curtailed press freedom and stymied EU efforts to tackle the migrant crisis.\n\nHungary has held discussions with Israel about purchasing security fences to keep migrants out, while Israel has sought better ties with countries that it hopes will take its side in any EU discussions where Israel is criticized.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Hungarian government poster portraying financier George Soros and saying 'Don't let George Soros have the last laugh' is seen at a tram stop in Budapest, Hungary July 6, 2017.

"A black off-duty cop tried to help stop a crime. Another officer shot him.\nA “friendly fire” incident in which an off-duty St. Louis policeman was shot while coming to the aid of fellow officers has taken on racial overtones after an incendiary claim by the injured officer’s attorney: The officer was viewed as a threat because he was black.\n\nThe St. Louis Police Department has not identified any of the officers involved in Wednesday night’s incident. The officer who shot the off-duty policeman is white. All seven officers involved are on administrative leave as the department sorts out what happened.\n\nWhat is known is that officers with an anti-crime task force were tracking a car that was stolen from the Maryland Heights community after its license plate had been detected by an automatic reader Wednesday night, interim police chief Lawrence O’Toole told reporters.\n\nDuring the chase, the armed men inside the car opened fire.\n\nOfficers fired back, hitting one of the men in the ankle during the ensuing exchange. The vehicle ultimately crashed in a neighborhood on the north side of the city and the occupants jumped out and ran, police said. The man shot in the ankle was quickly arrested, along with a teenager who was caught after a brief chase. A third man — who police believed was armed — got away and remained at large Sunday.\n\n[Video shows an officer slamming, then pummeling a black man accused of jaywalking]\n\nAn off-duty officer who lives nearby heard the commotion, grabbed his service pistol and headed to the scene to assist his fellow officers. He arrived as the other officers were carrying out the arrest.\n\nThe other officers ordered the off-duty officer to the ground, then recognized him as a fellow policeman and told him to stand up and walk toward them.\n\nAs he approached, another officer arrived and shot the off-duty officer in the arm, “apparently not recognizing” him, police told the Associated Press.\n\nThe black officer, who is 38 years old and an 11-year veteran of the force, was treated at the hospital and released. The shooter, a 36-year-old officer who has been on the force for eight years, told investigators he had feared for his safety.\n\nUpdated information relative to last night's officer involved shooting/injured officer in the 5900 block of Astra. pic.twitter.com/TlJP7ghs9p — St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) June 22, 2017\n\nBut Rufus Tate Jr., the black officer’s attorney, took issue with that claim, saying his client complied with the other officers’ commands and was never a threat.\n\n“In the police report, you have so far, there is no description of threat he received,” he told St. Louis Fox-affiliate KTVI. “So we have a real problem with that. But this has been a national discussion for the past two years. There is this perception that a black man is automatically feared.”\n\nTate said the incident was a case of “a black professional, in law enforcement, himself being shot and treated as an ordinary black guy on the street. This is a real problem.”\n\nThe St. Louis area was once the epicenter of the nation’s ongoing debate about whether police are too quick to use deadly force against minorities.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge awarded $1.5 million to the parents of Michael Brown, according to the Associated Press. Brown, 18, was unarmed on Aug. 9, 2014, when he was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a white officer, during a confrontation in Ferguson, about 20 minutes from St. Louis.\n\nMonths of protests followed Brown’s shooting. Ultimately, a Justice Department investigation unearthed bias in the criminal justice system in Ferguson, although Wilson was never criminally charged.\n\n[A body cam captured a cop’s violent encounter with a teen — but a new law keeps the video secret]\n\nWilson resigned in November 2014, and Brown’s parents sued the city.\n\nBut Brown’s killing was just one of many such incidents. In Minnesota last summer, Philando Castile was shot after a police officer pulled him over for a broken brake light. And a North Charleston police officer recently pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge after he shot and killed 50-year-old Walter Scott, an unarmed motorist, as he was running away.\n\nSo far this year, 461 people have been shot and killed by police officers, according to a Washington Post database of police shootings. A quarter of them were black.\n\nIn 2016, 963 people were killed by police. Twenty-four percent were black.\n\nRead more:\n\nThis attorney wore a Black Lives Matter pin to court — and went to jail for it\n\n‘I was just reading a book’: Canadian cops called on black man reading C.S.

"What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings? International Comparisons Suggest an Answer\nWorldwide, Mr. Lankford found, a country’s rate of gun ownership correlated with the odds it would experience a mass shooting. This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.\n\nFactors That Don’t Correlate\n\nIf mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.\n\nA 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.\n\nWhether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.\n\nRacial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Violent Country\n\nAmerica’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.\n\nAmericans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nRather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.\n\nThey concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.\n\nMore gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.\n\nThis suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.\n\nPhoto\n\nComparisons in Other Societies\n\nSkeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.\n\nAs with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.\n\nBy contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.\n\nBeyond the Statistics\n\nIn 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.\n\nThis means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.\n\nThe United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.\n\nSwitzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.\n\nSwiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Difference Is Culture\n\nThe United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.\n\nAfter Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.\n\nThat choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.\n\n“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html","1510030800.0"
"IMF could be based in Beijing in a decade: Lagarde\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund could be based in Beijing in a decade if growth trends for China and other big emerging markets continue and these are reflected in the Fund’s voting structure, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Monday.\n\nChristine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), attends a conference at the Cannes Lions Festival in Cannes, France, June 23, 2017. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nLagarde said at a Center for Global Development event in Washington that such a move was “a possibility” because the Fund will need to increase the representation of major emerging markets as their economies grow larger and more influential.\n\n“Which might very well mean, that if we have this conversation in 10 years’ time...we might not be sitting in Washington, D.C. We’ll do it in our Beijing head office,” Lagarde said.\n\nShe added that the IMF’s bylaws call for the institution’s head office to be located in the largest member economy.\n\nSince the IMF was launched in 1945, that has always been the United States, which currently has an effective veto over IMF decisions with a 16.5 percent share of its board votes.\n\nBut economists estimate that China, with growth rates forecast above 6 percent, will likely overtake U.S. gross domestic product sometime over the next decade to become the world’s largest economy in nominal terms. Some, including the IMF, have argued that China already contributes more to global growth on a purchasing power parity basis, which adjusts for differences in prices.\n\nThe IMF last revised its quota system, or voting structure in 2010, but is set to launch another review next year.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-china-lagarde-idUSKBN1A922L","1500912831.0"
"U.S. submits formal notice of withdrawal from Paris climate pact\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has officially informed the United Nations it will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement in a document issued on Friday, but left the door open to re-engaging if the terms improved for the United States.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump pauses as he announces his decision that the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nThe State Department said in a press release the United States would continue to participate in United Nations climate change meetings during the withdrawal process, which is expected to take at least three years.\n\n“The United States supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security,” the department said in the release.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris deal in June, saying the accord would have cost America trillions of dollars, killed jobs, and hindered the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.\n\nBut he also, at the time, said he would be open to renegotiating the deal, which was agreed by nearly 200 nations over the course of years - drawing ridicule from world and business leaders who said that would be impossible.\n\nDuring a visit last month to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, the two discussed the deal and Trump told reporters “Something could happen with respect to the Paris accords, let’s see what happens.”\n\n“As the President indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers,” the State Department said in its press release about the formal notice of withdrawal.\n\nRepublican U.S. congressional leaders have backed Trump’s move to exit the accord. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, said it was “another significant blow to the Obama administration’s assault on domestic energy production and jobs”.\n\nBut numerous business leaders have called the move a blow to international efforts to combat climate change, and a missed opportunity to capture growth in the emerging clean energy industry.\n\nThe United States, under former President Barack Obama, had pledged as part of the Paris accord to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 to help slow global warming.\n\nThe earliest date for the United States to completely withdraw from the agreement is Nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-climate-usa-paris/u-s-submits-formal-notice-of-withdrawal-from-paris-climate-pact-idUSKBN1AK2FM","1501881919.0"
"Zimbabwe army has Robert Mugabe in custody and seizes state TV\nJacob Zuma, president of neighboring South Africa, said he had spoken by phone to Mugabe, who was confined to his home, and to Zimbabwe's military chiefs.\n\n'I hope that they will be able to respect the constitution of Zimbabwe so that this situation does not go beyond the situation where it is now,' Zuma said.\n\nSoldiers stationed themselves at key points in Harare while Zimbabweans formed long lines at banks to withdraw cash — a routine chore in a country plagued by economic crisis and hyperinflation. Overnight, at least three explosions were heard.\n\nIt was not clear whether the military planned to permanently remove Mugabe, who has been in power since the end of white minority rule in 1980, or whether it simply wanted to prevent Grace Mugabe from assuming power.\n\n'We knew that a day such as this one was on its way,' said Promise Mkwananzi, spokesman for the opposition pressure group Tajamuka and a former leader of the Zimbabwe National Students Union. 'It was only a matter of time.'\n\n'The Crocodile' to be installed as president?\n\nHe speculated that army chiefs would install a pro-military leader such as Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom Mugabe fired last week as vice president.\n\nThey might even allow Mugabe 'to continue as a figurehead president,' Mkwananzi said.\n\nMnangagwa, 75, is a former Mugabe ally who earned the nickname 'Ngwena,' or 'The Crocodile,' after leading a group of fighters called the Crocodile Gang during the country's pre-1980 war of independence, Voice of America reported. He was sentenced to death for blowing up trains in the 1960s but was never executed because of his young age.\n\n'This is a coup. There's no question about that.' 'This is a coup. There's no question about that.'\n\nThe military move came after army commander Constantino Chiwenga threatened to 'step in' to calm political tensions. Mugabe's ruling party, ZANU-PF, responded by accusing the general of 'treasonable conduct.' But now Chiwenga appears to be in control.\n\nTendai Biti, leader of the opposition People's Democratic Party, said: 'If it fluffs like a duck, waddles like a duck, then it's a duck. This is a coup. There's no question about that.'\n\nHe added: 'The real issue now is how do we go back to our former, legitimate legal order, and in my view this is the time to introduce an inclusive national transitional authority that will establish a road map towards a democracy.'\n\nMilitary vehicles and soldiers patrol Harare, Zimbabwe, on Wednesday. Philimon Bulawayo / Reuters\n\nFrustration has been growing in once-prosperous Zimbabwe as the economy collapsed under Mugabe after 37 years of near one-party rule. The country was shaken last year by the biggest anti-government protests in a decade.\n\nChris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe's influential war veterans, pinned the blame on Grace Mugabe.\n\n'It's the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife,' he told Reuters.\n\nDavid Coltart, a human rights lawyer and former minister in Zimbabwe, said the military intervention was unlikely to bring significant change — but he did offer some hope to wearied citizens.\n\n'It's a reversal of Mugabe's desire to create a Mugabe dynasty, no doubt about that,' he told Britain's ITV News. The military behind this action have been 'limited participants' in politics, he said, and 'unless they've changed their colors, it won't necessarily result in a transition to democracy.'\n\nUnder Mugabe's rule, people believed the country's economic crisis would continue to worsen, Coltart said. 'I think this gives them some hope that the country may stabilize or that the military will, in effect, allow a transition to a new democratic order.'\n\nMugabe's latest five-year term began in 2013 after elections that the United States said were flawed. Washington said it had no plans to loosen sanctions until there were signs of change in the country.\n\nMugabe told his critics to 'go hang,' and reportedly served elephant meat at his 91st birthday celebrations.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Peace Project reported a near 50 percent month-to-month increase in human rights violations in July, the latest period for which it had figures. Violations included 'political rights, right to personal security, freedom of association, freedom from arbitrary eviction, property rights and the right to food among others,' it said.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 15, 1 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated Emmerson Mnangagwa's age. He is 75, not 71.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zimbabwe-army-controls-broadcaster-says-mugabe-wife-are-safe-n820926","None"
"North Korea nuclear threat: Mattis warns of 'massive military response'\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Any US response would be 'effective and overwhelming' - James Mattis\n\nPentagon chief James Mattis says any threat to the US or its allies by North Korea will be met with a 'massive military response'.\n\nHis comments came after a national security briefing with President Donald Trump about the secretive communist state's latest nuclear test.\n\nPyongyang says it has successfully trialled a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to a long-range missile.\n\nThe move has drawn international condemnation.\n\nNorth Korea has defied UN sanctions and international pressure by developing nuclear weapons and test missiles that could potentially reach the US.\n\nBut speaking to reporters outside the White House, Defence Secretary Mattis said the US had the ability to defend itself and its allies South Korea and Japan, adding that its commitments were 'ironclad'.\n\n'Any threat to the United States or its territories - including Guam - or our allies will be met with a massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming.'\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nuclear N Korea: What do we know?\n\nHowever, he said the hope was for denuclearisation, 'because we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea'.\n\nThe UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss an international response, according to the US mission.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump has warned that America may stop trading with any country that does business with the North.\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nThe first suggestion that this was to be a far from normal Sunday in the region came when seismologists' equipment started picking up readings of an earth tremor in the area where North Korea has conducted nuclear tests before.\n\nThe US Geological Survey put the tremor at 6.3 magnitude.\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said there was no doubt this was North Korea's sixth nuclear test, calling it 'unforgivable'.\n\nThen North Korean state media confirmed this was no earthquake.\n\nIt claimed the country had conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, detonating a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto a long-range missile.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption North Korean state media announces 'hydrogen bomb' test\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un was pictured with what state media said was a new type of hydrogen bomb.\n\nHydrogen bombs are many times more powerful than an atomic bomb. They use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash huge amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms.\n\nAnalysts say the North's claims should be treated with caution, but that its nuclear capability is clearly advancing.\n\nOfficials in China, where the blast was felt as a tremor, said they were carrying out emergency radiation testing along the border with North Korea.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nDenouncing the test as 'hostile' and 'dangerous', President Trump described the North as a 'rogue nation' which had become a 'great threat and embarrassment' to China - Pyongyang's main ally.\n\nHe also said South Korea's 'talk of appeasement' was not working and that the secretive communist state 'only understands one thing'.\n\n'The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea,' Mr Trump later said in a tweet. North Korea relies on China for about 90% of its foreign trade.\n\nImage copyright Reuters/KCNA Image caption State media showed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting what it said was a hydrogen bomb\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in called for the 'strongest possible' response, including new UN Security Council sanctions to 'completely isolate' the country.\n\nThe country staged a 'live-fire exercise' late on Sunday simulating an attack on the North's Punggye-ri nuclear site, military officials said.\n\nThe drill saw a Hyunmoo surface-to-surface missile and air-to-ground missiles fired from F-15K jets hit targets in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff quoted by Yonhap news agency.\n\nChina, meanwhile, also expressed 'strong condemnation' and said the state 'had ignored the international community's widespread opposition'.\n\nRussia urged all sides involved to hold talks, saying this was the only way to resolve the Korean peninsula's problems.\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May said the 'reckless' new test represented an 'unacceptable further threat to the international community'. She called on world leaders to come together to stop North Korea's 'destabilising actions'.\n\nWhat does the test tell us?\n\nSouth Korean officials said the latest test took place in Kilju County, where the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site is situated. The 'artificial quake' was 9.8 times more powerful than the tremor from the North's fifth test in September 2016, the state weather agency said.\n\nAlthough experts urged caution, this does appear to be the biggest and most successful nuclear test by North Korea to date - and the messaging is clear. North Korea wants to demonstrate it knows what makes a credible nuclear warhead.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear tests\n\nNuclear weapons expert Catherine Dill told the BBC it was not yet clear exactly what nuclear weapon design was tested.\n\n'But based on the seismic signature, the yield of this test definitely is an order of magnitude higher than the yields of the previous tests.'\n\nCurrent information did not definitively indicate that a thermonuclear weapon had been tested 'but it appears to be a likely possibility at this point', she said\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nBy Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent\n\nNorth Korea's sixth nuclear test - probably its largest so far - sends out one clear political signal.\n\nDespite the bluster and threats from the Trump administration in Washington and near-universal condemnation from around the world, Pyongyang is not going to halt or constrain its nuclear activities.\n\nWorryingly, it also suggests that this is a programme that is progressing on all fronts at a faster rate than many had expected. So far all efforts to pressure North Korea - sanctions, isolation and military threats - have all failed to move Pyongyang.\n\nCould more be done? Certainly, but the harshest economic pressure would potentially cripple the regime and push it towards catastrophe - something China is unwilling to countenance.\n\nContainment and deterrence will now come to the fore as the world adjusts its policy from seeking to roll-back Pyongyang's weapons programme to living with a nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaking before the new nuclear test, Senator Lindsey Graham told BBC HARDtalk a US attack was inevitable if diplomacy failed\n\nWill China clamp down?\n\nBy Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai\n\nNorth Korea's sixth nuclear weapons test is an utter rejection of all that its only ally has called for.\n\nBeijing's response was predictable - condemnation, urging an end to provocation and dialogue. But it also spoke of urging North Korea to 'face up to the firm will' of the international community to see denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula.\n\nThere is no sign, though, that China is willing yet to see that 'firm will' go beyond UN sanctions, which recently clamped down on seafood and iron ore exports, in addition to the coal and minerals that are already banned from crossing the border.\n\nIt is noteworthy also that this test took place just as the Chinese president was about to welcome a handful of world leaders to the two-day showpiece Brics summit on China's east coast.\n\nEven the state-controlled media will find it hard to ignore the fact that their man has been upstaged - embarrassed too - by its almost universally ostracised ally and neighbour.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41140621","None"

"'Religious left' emerging as U.S. political force in Trump era\n(Reuters) - Since President Donald Trump’s election, monthly lectures on social justice at the 600-seat Gothic chapel of New York’s Union Theological Seminary have been filled to capacity with crowds three times what they usually draw.\n\nIn January, the 181-year-old Upper Manhattan graduate school, whose architecture evokes London’s Westminster Abbey, turned away about 1,000 people from a lecture on mass incarceration. In the nine years that Reverend Serene Jones has served as its president, she has never seen such crowds.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS\n\nMore Democrats oppose Trump's Supreme Court pick\n\nAfter healthcare flop, White House looks to Congress for help on tax reform\n\nObamacare exploding? Maybe just a slow burn\n\n“The election of Trump has been a clarion call to progressives in the Protestant and Catholic churches in America to move out of a place of primarily professing progressive policies to really taking action,” she said.\n\nAlthough not as powerful as the religious right, which has been credited with helping elect Republican presidents and boasts well-known leaders such as Christian Broadcasting Network founder Pat Robertson, the “religious left” is now slowly coming together as a force in U.S. politics.\n\nThis disparate group, traditionally seen as lacking clout, has been propelled into political activism by Trump’s policies on immigration, healthcare and social welfare, according to clergy members, activists and academics. A key test will be how well it will be able to translate its mobilization into votes in the 2018 midterm congressional elections.\n\n“It’s one of the dirty little secrets of American politics that there has been a religious left all along and it just hasn’t done a good job of organizing,” said J. Patrick Hornbeck II, chairman of the theology department at Fordham University, a Jesuit school in New York.\n\n“It has taken a crisis, or perceived crisis, like Trump’s election to cause folks on the religious left to really own their religion in the public square,” Hornbeck said.\n\nReligious progressive activism has been part of American history. Religious leaders and their followers played key roles in campaigns to abolish slavery, promote civil rights and end the Vietnam War, among others. The latest upwelling of left-leaning religious activism has accompanied the dawn of the Trump presidency.\n\nSome in the religious left are inspired by Pope Francis, the Roman Catholic leader who has been an outspoken critic of anti-immigrant policies and a champion of helping the needy.\n\nAlthough support for the religious left is difficult to measure, leaders point to several examples, such as a surge of congregations offering to provide sanctuary to immigrants seeking asylum, churches urging Republicans to reconsider repealing the Obamacare health law and calls to preserve federal spending on foreign aid.\n\nThe number of churches volunteering to offer sanctuary to asylum seekers doubled to 800 in 45 of the 50 U.S. states after the election, said the Elkhart, Indiana-based Church World Service, a coalition of Christian denominations which helps refugees settle in the United States - and the number of new churches offering help has grown so quickly that the group has lost count.\n\n“The religious community, the religious left is getting out, hitting the streets, taking action, raising their voices,” said Reverend Noel Anderson, its national grassroots coordinator.\n\nIn one well-publicized case, a Quaker church in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on March 14 took in a Honduran woman who has been living illegally in the United States for 25 years and feared she would be targeted for deportation.\n\n‘NEVER SEEN’ THIS\n\nLeaders of Faith in Public Life, a progressive policy group, were astounded when 300 clergy members turned out at a January rally at the U.S. Senate attempting to block confirmation of Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, because of his history of controversial statements on race.\n\n“I’ve never seen hundreds of clergy turning up like that to oppose a Cabinet nominee,” said Reverend Jennifer Butler, the group’s chief executive.\n\nThe group on Wednesday convened a Capitol Hill rally of hundreds of pastors from as far away as Ohio, North Carolina and Texas to urge Congress to ensure that no people lose their health insurance as a result of a vote to repeal Obamacare.\n\nFinancial support is also picking up. Donations to the Christian activist group Sojourners have picked up by 30 percent since Trump’s election, the group said.\n\nBut some observers were skeptical that the religious left could equal the religious right politically any time soon.\n\n“It really took decades of activism for the religious right to become the force that it is today,” said Peter Ubertaccio, chairman of the political science department at Stonehill College, a Catholic school outside Boston.\n\nBut the power potential of the “religious left” is not negligible. The “Moral Mondays” movement, launched in 2013 by the North Carolina NAACP’s Reverend William Barber, is credited with contributing to last year’s election defeat of Republican Governor Pat McCrory by Democrat Roy Cooper.\n\nThe new political climate is also spurring new alliances, with churches, synagogues and mosques speaking out against the recent spike in bias incidents, including threats against mosques and Jewish community centers.\n\nThe Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, which encourages alliances between Jewish and Muslim women, has tripled its number of U.S. chapters to nearly 170 since November, said founder Sheryl Olitzky.\n\n“This is not about partisanship, but about vulnerable populations who need protection, whether it’s the LGBT community, the refugee community, the undocumented community,” said Rabbi Jonah Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, using the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.\n\nMore than 1,000 people have already signed up for the center’s annual Washington meeting on political activism, about three times as many as normal, Pesner said.\n\nLeaders of the religious right who supported Trump say they see him delivering on his promises and welcomed plans to defund Planned Parenthood, whose healthcare services for women include abortion, through the proposed repeal of Obamacare.\n\n“We have not seen any policy proposals that run counter to our faith,” said Lance Lemmonds, a spokesman for the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a nonprofit group based in Duluth, Georgia.\n\nPresident of the Union Theological Seminary Serene Jones poses at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan.

"Dove Expresses 'Regret' For Racially Insensitive Ad\nDove Expresses 'Regret' For Racially Insensitive Ad\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBeauty brand Dove deleted a 'three-second video clip' from its Facebook page and admitted Saturday that it had 'missed the mark in thoughtfully representing women of color' in an ad for body wash. Consumers had reacted angrily to images of a black woman removing a brown shirt and appearing to transform into a white woman removing a similar shirt.\n\nAuthor Habeeb Akande summarized some of the outrage to the ad when he tweeted that it showed 'a black woman turning white after using @Dove.'\n\nDove issued mea culpas via Twitter and Facebook, saying it 'missed the mark in thoughtfully representing women of color and we deeply regret the offense that it has caused. The feedback that has been shared is important to us and we'll use it to guide us in the future.'\n\nThe Guardian reports that makeup artist Naomi Blake, whose Facebook name is Naythemua, was able to preserve a screen grab of the ad before Dove pulled it. Blake posted on Friday, 'So I'm scrolling through Facebook and this is the#dove ad that comes up.... ok so what am I looking at....'\n\nMany of the nearly 1,000 responses agreed that the ad was offensive, even racist. But not everybody felt that way. Somebody posting under the name Caressa Cornelius wrote, 'I'm not understanding why people are so offended.' And somebody identified as Jessica Cannady wrote, 'there was nothing wrong with the commercial ... Lets do better and not over think things.'\n\nBut someone posting under the name Raenette Johnson said, 'For people to say black woman are reaching and being sensitive lemme break this down..... Dove is advertising bodywash, which means that this product removes dirt/ has the ability to get you clean, POINT BLANK!'\n\nAnd as CNN political commentator Keith Boykin pointed out, this is not the first time Dove has found itself in hot water for the way it has advertised body wash.\n\n'Okay, Dove ... One racist ad makes you suspect. Two racist ads makes you kinda guilty,' Boykin tweeted.\n\nIn 2011, Dove released a body wash ad showing three women with a range of skin tones standing in a row, the word 'before' above the head of the woman with darker skin and 'after' above the head of the woman with lighter skin.\n\nGawker wrote at the time, 'Dove VisibleCare body wash: 'Visibly more beautiful skin.' Bye-bye black skin, hello white skin! (Scrub hard!)'\n\nDove said in a statement to Gawker, 'All three women are intended to demonstrate the 'after' product benefit.

"Mysterious Radioactive Cloud Over Europe Hints At Accident Farther East\nMysterious Radioactive Cloud Over Europe Hints At Accident Farther East\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption CTBTO/FLICKR CTBTO/FLICKR\n\nEuropean authorities are providing new details about a cloud of mysterious radioactive material that appeared over the continent last month.\n\nMonitors in Italy were among first to detect the radioactive isotope ruthenium-106 on Oct. 3, according to a fresh report by France's Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute, known as IRSN. In total, 28 European countries saw the radioactive cloud, the report says.\n\nThe multinational Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation, which runs a network designed to monitor for nuclear weapons tests, also confirmed to NPR that it had detected the cloud.\n\nBased on the detection from monitoring stations and meteorological data, the mysterious cloud — which has since dissipated — has been traced to somewhere along the Russia-Kazakhstan border, according to Jean-Christophe Gariel, director for health at the IRSN.\n\n'It's somewhere in South Russia,' he says, likely between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains.\n\nAuthorities say the amount of material seen in Europe was small. 'It's a very low level of radioactivity and it poses no problems for health and the environment in Europe,' Gariel says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption IRSN IRSN\n\nBut modeling suggests that any people within a few kilometers of the release — wherever it occurred — would have needed to seek shelter to protect themselves from possible radiation exposure.\n\n'If it would have happened in France, we would have taken measures to protect the population in a radius of a few kilometers,' Gariel says. French authorities, he adds, will conduct random checks of foodstuffs from the region to check for possible contamination of agricultural products.\n\nRuthenium-106 is a radioactive isotope that is not found in nature. 'It's an unusual isotope,' says Anders Ringbom, the research director of the Swedish Defence Research Agency, which runs radioactive monitoring for that nation. 'I don't think we have seen it since the Chernobyl accident.'\n\nThe IRSN analysis suggests that the ruthenium did not come from a nuclear reactor accident. Instead, it most likely came from either the chemical reprocessing of old nuclear fuel or the production of isotopes used in medicine. Based on the size of the release, Gariel says, whatever happened had to have been accidental.\n\n'It's not an authorized release, we are sure about that,' he says.\n\nA handful of Russian nuclear facilities are located roughly in the region where the ruthenium originated, including a large nuclear reprocessing plant known as the Mayak Production Association.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Mayak plant turned used nuclear fuel into material for nuclear weapons. The plant has been the site of numerous past accidents, including a 1957 explosion that rivaled the nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima and Chernobyl.\n\nGariel says that while Mayak is a possible source of the cloud, there simply aren't enough data to conclusively link it to the release of radioactive material. He also says he has spoken to Russian safety officials over the past few days and that while they do not dispute his analysis, they are unaware of any incidents in the region in the past few months.\n\nNPR's Alina Selyukh contributed to this report.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/10/563286253/mysterious-radioactive-cloud-over-europe-hints-at-accident-farther-east","1510290000.0"
"As North Korea Speeds Its Nuclear Program, U.S. Fears Time Will Run Out\nA Growing Arsenal\n\nInside the C.I.A., they call it “the disco ball.”\n\nIt is a round, metallic sphere, covered by small circles, that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is shown caressing in official photographs as if it were his crown jewel. And it may be: The sphere is supposedly a nuclear weapon, shrunken to fit inside the nose cone of one of the country’s growing arsenal of missiles.\n\nAmerican intelligence officials still debate whether it is a real bomb or a mock-up that is part of the country’s vast propaganda effort.

KN-14 6,200 United States KN-08 7,200 Estimated ranges\n\nUnless something changes, North Korea’s arsenal may well hit 50 weapons by the end of Mr. Trump’s term, about half the size of Pakistan’s. American officials say the North already knows how to shrink those weapons so they can fit atop one of its short- to medium-range missiles — putting South Korea and Japan, and the thousands of American troops deployed in those two nations, within range. The best estimates are that North Korea has roughly 1,000 ballistic missiles in eight or so varieties.\n\nBut fulfilling Mr. Kim’s dream — putting a nuclear weapon atop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach Seattle or Los Angeles, or one day New York — remains a more complex problem.\n\nAs Dr. Hecker, a man who has built his share of nuclear weapons, noted last week, any weapon that could travel that far would have to be “smaller, lighter and surmount the additional difficulties of the stresses and temperatures” of a fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.\n\nBy most estimates, that is four or five years away. Then again, many senior officials said the same four or five years ago.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the North has come farther than most experts expected since the infancy of its program in the 1950s, when the Soviet Union began training North Korean scientists in nuclear basics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt took three decades for the North to assemble the technology it needed to make its own bomb fuel. Finally, from a reactor at Yongbyon, it succeeded in making plutonium: enough for about one atomic bomb a year.\n\nThe first North Korean nuclear crisis, in 1994, ended in an agreement with the Clinton administration to freeze the North’s production facilities in return for oil and peaceful reactors. It fell apart early in the George W. Bush administration. In 2006, the first test explosion, while unimpressive, entered North Korea into the club of nuclear powers. Analysts say the first blast was a plutonium bomb, as was a second detonation just months into the Obama administration in 2009.\n\nDr. Hecker visited Yongbyon in 2010, and the North Koreans showed him a complete uranium enrichment facility, which American intelligence agencies had missed. The message was clear: The North now had two pathways to a bomb, uranium and plutonium. Today, it has an arsenal made up of both, intelligence officials say.\n\nAnd it is aiming for something much bigger: a hydrogen bomb, with a destructive force up to 1,000 times greater than ordinary nuclear weapons. That is exactly the path the United States took in the 1950s.\n\nRecently, United Nations investigators found evidence that the North’s factories had succeeded in producing lithium 6, a rare ingredient needed to make thermonuclear fuel. Gregory S. Jones, a scientist at the RAND Corporation, said the North might have already used bits of thermonuclear fuel in its 2016 detonations.\n\nA potential clue, analysts say, is that the North’s five blasts over the past decade have grown steadily more destructive.\n\nShrinking the Bomb\n\nA bomb is useless to North Korea — as an offensive weapon or as a deterrent — unless the country can make a convincing case that it has a reliable delivery system. So when the North flaunts missiles at military parades, as it did on April 15, the stars of the show tend to be the big missiles that are designed to reach Washington and New York. While several intercontinental ballistic missiles rolled down the streets of Pyongyang, conducting a flight test that proves one could fly that far, and land with accuracy, is so far only an aspiration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

American intelligence agencies believe some of those can carry operational nuclear arms. The critical one is the Nodong, which has a range of about 800 miles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the North Koreans are discovering — as the United States, the Soviet Union and China did before them — that it is far more complicated to design an intercontinental missile. With that weapons system, a warhead would move at four miles a second and re-enter the atmosphere in fiery heat — so, if badly engineered, it would burn up long before hitting a target. To reach their goal, North Korean weapons designers are looking to miniaturize their warheads, making them far lighter and more powerful.\n\nThe big effort these days is to merge two technologies: Get a missile that can cross the Pacific, and marry it to a warhead that can survive the ride. And this is why the United States is so desperate to stop the cycle of testing.\n\nThe cyber- and electronic warfare attacks that President Barack Obama ordered against the country’s missile fleet were intended to slow North Korea’s learning curve. The Musudan, which can travel 2,200 miles, has racked up an embarrassing failure rate of 88 percent — although how much of that is due to incompetence or outside meddling is not known. Until the North Koreans figure out what is going wrong, and how to fix it, they appear hesitant to test the KN-14 and the KN-08, both of which are designed to hit the continental United States.\n\nVideo\n\nThe diplomatic pressure from China to stop a sixth nuclear test at the Punggye-ri test site is intended to keep the North Koreans from making advances in warhead miniaturization and the design of a hydrogen bomb. As Mr. Obama noted before he left office, even failures are important learning tools for the North Koreans, aiding the trial-and-error process of making new warheads.\n\nHow long will it take for the North Koreans to solve those problems? The best guesswork is around 2020 — while Mr. Trump is still in his first term.\n\nA Freeze, to What End?\n\nThe strategy emerging from Mr. Trump’s national security team comes down to this: Apply overwhelming pressure on the North, both military and economic, to freeze its testing and reduce its stockpile. Then use that opening to negotiate, with the ultimate goal of getting the North Koreans to give up all their weapons.\n\nMany experts, however, believe that is a fantasy, because Mr. Kim regards even a small arsenal as critical to his survival. The upside of the strategy, if it works, is that the “nuclear freeze” would delay for years the day the North can fit a small, reliable, well-tested weapon atop a large, reliable, well-tested missile. The downside is that it would leave the North Koreans with a small, potent arsenal — one the United States would be essentially acknowledging, if not accepting.\n\nThat is why it will be hard for Mr. Trump to fulfill his vow to “solve this problem.” And every day, there is the chance of miscalculation, or an accident.\n\nAt any moment, Dr. Hecker said on a call to reporters organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a live weapon could turn into an accidental nuclear detonation or some other catastrophe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I happen to believe,” he said, “the crisis is here now.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-missile-program.html","1493006400.0"

"Survivors recall deadly mosque attack in Egypt\nISMAILIA, Egypt -- They arrived in five SUVs, took positions across from the mosque's door and windows, and just as the imam was about to deliver his Friday sermon from atop the pulpit, they opened fire and tossed grenades at the estimated 500 worshippers inside. When the violence finally stopped, more than 300 people, including 27 children, had been killed and 128 injured.\n\nThe blasts shook the mosque, worshippers screamed and cried out in pain. A stampede broke out in the rush toward a door leading to the washrooms. Others tried desperately to force their way out of the windows.\n\nThose who survived spoke of children screaming as they saw parents and older brothers mowed down by gunfire or shredded by the blasts. Some marveled at their narrow escape from a certain death. Some families lost all or most male members in the massacre.\n\nSo composed were the militants that they methodically checked their victims for any sign of life after the initial round of blazing gunfire. Those still moving or breathing received a bullet to the head or the chest, the witnesses said. When the ambulances arrived they shot at them, repelling them as they got back into their vehicles and fled.\n\nCBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that Egypt's response to the massacre came as quickly as they could fire up their war planes. The Egyptian military released video Saturday claiming to show fighter jets targeting vehicles in Friday's attack that they said killed suspected militants inside.\n\nFriday's assault was Egypt's deadliest attack by Islamic extremists in the country's modern history, a grim milestone in a long-running fight against an insurgency led by a local affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Al-Rawdah Mosque was in a sleepy village by the same name in Egypt's troubled northern Sinai, near the small town of Bir al-Abd.\n\nA statement by the country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, said the attackers, some masked, numbered between 25 and 30. Those with bare faces sported heavy beards and long hair, it added. Clad in military-style camouflage pants and black T-shirts, one of them carried a black banner with the declaration of the Muslim faith -- there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet. The banner matched those carried by ISIS, which has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThey also torched seven cars parked outside the mosque that belonged to worshippers, the statement added.\n\nThe chief prosecutor's statement was the most detailed account given by authorities and it generally agreed with what witnesses told The Associated Press on Saturday in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, where some of the wounded are hospitalized.\n\n'We knew that the mosque was under attack by (militants),' said witness Ebid Salem Mansour recalling the intense gunfire. Mansour, a 38-year-old worker in a nearby salt factory, said he had settled in Bir al-Abd three years ago to escape the bloodshed and fighting elsewhere in northern Sinai. He suffered two gunshot wounds to his legs on Friday.\n\n'Everyone lay down on the floor and kept their heads down. If you raised your head you get shot,' he said. 'The shooting was random and hysterical at the beginning and then became more deliberate. Whoever they weren't sure was dead or still breathing was shot dead.'\n\nThe militants were shouting Allahu Akbar, or God is great, as they fired at the worshippers and the children were screaming, Mansour added. 'I knew I was injured but I was in a situation that was much scarier than being wounded. I was only seconds away from a certain death,' he said. Amid the shooting many worshippers recited their final prayers, he added.\n\nFriday's attack targeted a mosque frequented by Sufis, members of a mystic movement within Islam. Islamic militants, including the local ISIS affiliate, consider Sufis heretics because of their less literal interpretations of the faith.\n\nPresident Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi vowed that the attack 'will not go unpunished' and that Egypt would persevere with its war on terrorism. He did not specify what new steps might be taken. On Saturday, he ordered that a mausoleum be built in memory of the victims of Friday's attack and canceled a visit to the Gulf Sultanate of Oman that was scheduled for next week.\n\nThe military and security forces have already been waging a tough and costly campaign against militants in the towns, villages and desert mountains of northern Sinai, and Egypt has been in a state of emergency since April. Across the country, thousands have been arrested in a crackdown on suspected Islamists as well as against other dissenters and critics, raising concerns about human rights violations.\n\nSeeking to spread the violence, militants over the past year have carried out deadly bombings on churches in the capital of Cairo and other cities, killing dozens of Christians. The ISIS affiliate is also believed to be behind the 2016 downing of a Russian passenger jet that killed 224 people over Sinai, an incident that decimated the country's already ailing tourism industry.\n\nFriday's assault was the first major militant attack on a Muslim congregation, and it eclipsed past attacks, even dating back to a previous Islamic militant insurgency in the 1990s. The death of so many civilians in one day recalls the killing of at least 600 in August 2013, when Egyptian security forces broke up two sit-in protests in Cairo by supporters of Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist president ousted by the military the previous month.\n\nAnother witness to Friday's attack said worshippers tried to jump out of windows as soon as the militants opened fire. 'The small door that leads to the corridor for the wash rooms was about the only one where worshippers rushed to escape,' said a 38-year-old government employee who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation.\n\n'There was a stampede. I fell down and then bodies piled up on top of me,' he said.\n\nThe local ISIS group affiliate has targeted Sufis in the past.\n\nLast year, the militants beheaded a leading local Sufi religious figure, the blind sheikh Suleiman Abu Heraz, and posted photos of the killing online. ISIS propaganda often denounces Sufis. In the January edition of an ISIS online magazine, a figure purporting to be a high level official in the Sinai affiliate of the group vowed to target Sufis, accusing them of idolatry and heretical 'innovation' in religion and warning that the group will 'not permit (their) presence' in Sinai or Egypt.\n\nMillions of Egyptians belong to Sufi orders, which hold sessions of ritual chanting and dancing to draw the faithful closer to God. Sufis also hold shrines containing the tombs of holy men in particular reverence.\n\nIslamic militants stepped up their campaign of violence in northern Sinai after the military ousted the elected but divisive Morsi. Authorities followed up with a fierce crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood group, jailing thousands.\n\nThe result has been a long, grinding conflict centered on el-Arish and nearby villages and towns in north Sinai. The militants have been unable to control territory, but the military and security forces have also been unable to bring security, as the extremists continuously carry out surprise attacks, mostly targeting outposts and convoys.\n\nThe attacks have largely focused on military and police and, more recently, Christians. Hundreds have been killed, although exact numbers are unclear. The militants have also assassinated individuals the group considers to be spies for the government or religious heretics. Egypt has also faced attacks by militants in its Western Desert.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/survivors-recall-deadly-mosque-attack-egypt/","None"
"Diplomacy fails to defuse India, China border crisis: sources\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s diplomatic efforts to end a seven-week military standoff with China have hit a roadblock, people briefed on the talks said, prompting Chinese state-run media to trumpet rhetoric of “unavoidable countermeasures” on the unmarked border.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks inside a conference room used for meetings between military commanders of China and India, at the Indian side of the Indo-China border at Bumla, in the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, November 11, 2009.

Modi has sought closer ties with both.\n\n“There will be no happy ending for this confrontation,” Indian foreign policy expert C. Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper, adding that India was unlikely to give in.\n\nThe second source said the worry was the standoff could drag on into a summit of BRICs nations China is hosting next month.\n\nLIVE MANEUVERS\n\nIndian military officials say there is no troop buildup on either side, nearly two months into a standoff that involved about 300 soldiers just 100 meters (328 ft) apart on a plateau 3,000 m (10,000 ft) above sea level.\n\nChina has accused India of massing troops, however, and state media have warned against a fate worse than its defeat in a brief border war in 1962.\n\n“We will keep engaging with China to resolve the dispute. War cannot solve problems,” Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj told parliament, sticking to a conciliatory stance.\n\nStill, both have flexed their muscles.\n\nLast month, China held live-fire drills on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau near the site of the standoff, state media said.\n\nIndia’s army ran low-key exercises in the Ladakh sector of the western Himalayas, where previous disputes have flared, though it is thousands of miles distant from Doklam.\n\n“The chance of a conflict is low, nobody is expecting Xi Jinping to go to war before the Communist Party’s congress,” said Srikanth Kondapalli, a China specialist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, referring to an Oct-Nov meeting expected to confirm a second five-year term as party general secretary for the Chinese leader.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-china-idUSKBN1AO1D4","1502249316.0"
"Saudi-Iran standoff: Missile fired at palace highlights tensions\nCol. Turki al-Maliki, a Saudi military spokesman, called the launch Tuesday a 'hostile and indiscriminate action' that 'proves the continued involvement of the Iranian regime's support of the Houthi armed group.'\n\nLast week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., presented the charred remains of what she claimed was an Iranian-made missilethat was fired from Yemen toward Riyadh in November.\n\nShe held it up as proof that Iran was violating international restrictions on arms dealing.\n\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's influential crown prince, said after that launch that Iran was guilty of a 'direct military aggression' that could 'constitute an act of war.'\n\nIran dismissed the claim as 'fake and fabricated.' Its foreign minister, Javad Zarif, then compared Haley to Colin Powell and his 2003 statement, as secretary of state, about Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the U.S. criticized longtime ally Saudi Arabia, signed the nuclear deal with historic enemy Iran, and told the two counties that they needed to 'share the neighborhood.'\n\nBy contrast, President Donald Trump made Saudi Arabia his first foreign visit and has vehemently condemned Tehran.\n\nThis pivot has concerned some observers in Iran.\n\nFoad Izadi, an assistant professor at the University of Tehran, said the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 'started with false accusations against the Iraqi government.'\n\n'Seeing those signs again with the Trump administration is worrying to Iranian leaders because they don't want to have a war with the United States,' he said.\n\nWhile most analysts say all-out war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is unlikely, an animated video that went viral over the weekend raised the specter of just that.\n\nThe warlike fantasy imaged a Saudi warship sinking incoming Iranian boats, the kingdom's jets shooting Iranian planes out of the sky, and its tanks rolling through Tehran to the cheers of welcoming civilians.\n\nThe video received almost 900,000 views in just four days and was translated in English, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Spanish and Japanese.\n\nThere is no suggestion the video was created or endorsed by the government in Riyadh. NBC News received no immediate response when it reached out to Saudi officials; the YouTube account that posted the video also did not respond.\n\nIt comes almost two years after another video was circulated widely that showed Iranian missile strikes on several Saudi targets.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran are separated by the Persian Gulf. Google Maps\n\nThe two countries have had fractious relations for decades, but their rivalry has intensified since the 2015 coronation of King Salman, and the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed, referred to by many as M.B.S.\n\n'M.B.S. has been driving strategy in the kingdom in terms of economic and social policy but also a more aggressive regional policy,' said Peter Salisbury, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a think tank in London. 'He is trying to 'make Saudi Arabia great again' and to create a context where Saudi Arabia is the regional hegemon.'\n\nThe crown prince has pricked Western ears with bold reforms in the religious-conservative kingdom, vowing to crackdown on corruption, allowing women to drive and lifting the ban on concerts and movies.\n\nHe has coupled this with a more assertive brand of foreign-policy rhetoric, even comparing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to Hitler in an interview with The New York Times in November.\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia have entered into something of a cold war, not fighting each other directly but supporting an array of rival proxies. These conflicts are playing out in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, where Iran is fighting alongside government and Russian forces, and Saudi Arabia is supporting the embattled rebels.\n\nIn Yemen, the Saudi air war has drawn particular international criticism, with the U.S. and others providing arms, intelligence and aerial refueling power to a bombing campaign that many analysts say has caused a humanitarian crisis.\n\nAn F-15 fighter jet lands at an airbase in Saudi Arabia as the Saudis conduct operations over Yemen in 2015. Fayez Nureldine / AFP-Getty Images file\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia blame the wider standoff on each other.\n\nIzadi, at the University of Tehran, said the new Saudi rhetoric is merely designed to distract from the country's 'serious internal problems,' namely the endemic corruption that the crown prince says he wants to root out.\n\nOn the flip side, Firas Maksad, director of the Arabia Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, maintains that Saudi Arabia was forced to react to Iran's 'infiltrating Arab countries using proxy militias' and trying to spark Islamic revolutions abroad.\n\n'Saudi Arabia is, in essence, now compelled to play defense to Iran's increasingly aggressive offense,' Maksad said.\n\nAlthough it is in neither party's interests to wage a full-scale war, a conflict is not impossible purely because of both sides' refusal to back down, Salisbury said.\n\n'Iran has had a pretty good few years in terms of their military objectives, but they do not see a reason why they should be any less effective in the future,' he said. 'Saudi Arabia wants Iran to get back in its box, but Iran sees no reason why it should do so.'\n\nAli Arouzi reported from Tehran, and Alexander Smith from London.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/saudi-iran-standoff-missile-fired-palace-highlights-tensions-n830996","None"
"Not ‘Lone Wolves’ After All: How ISIS Guides World’s Terror Plots From Afar\nLocal Assets\n\nAt the time Amriki was killed last April, he had been exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of eight children, Mr. Yazdani, who is now 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad’s Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India.\n\nWhile abroad, he began watching the Islamic State’s online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate.\n\n“Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,” Mr. Yazdani told investigators from India’s National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company.\n\nHe logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group’s preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with Amriki.\n\n“I created a Telegram ID,” Mr. Yazdani told investigators, “and sought his guidance to reach Syria.”\n\nAfter months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Mr. Yazdani get a visa, Amriki’s directions changed course: “He asked me to work for I.S. by staying in India itself.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt was a period in which the Islamic State was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, Amriki handed off Mr. Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, “WindsofVictory.” His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi.\n\nThe new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Mr. Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves “Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind,” the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name.\n\nAt the end of May, Mr. Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men’s interrogations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polythene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),” Mr. Mohammed told investigators. “We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment.”\n\nWhen they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops that the handler set up for them.\n\nBecause the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees — around $1,000 — and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons.\n\nBecause the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said.\n\nThe Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Mr. Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Mr. Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive.\n\nOnce that system was in place, the handler told Mr. Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a “bayah,” to the Islamic State’s leader.\n\nMembers of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Mr. Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to www.gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men’s pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State. The file was uploaded around the time that Mr. Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said.\n\nThe men’s families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them.\n\nOne Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Mr. Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/isis-messaging-app-terror-plot.html","1486184400.0"
"At least 22 confirmed dead as Harvey pivots toward Louisiana\nHouston residents evacuate their homes amid Harvey flooding after a reservoir spilled over for the first time in history. (Dalton Bennett,Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post)\n\nHOUSTON — The biggest rainstorm in the history of the continental United States finally began to move away from Houston on Tuesday, as the remnants of Hurricane Harvey and its endless, merciless rain bands spun east to menace Louisiana instead.\n\nA storm surge warning for the coast from Holly Beach to Morgan City, La., said water levels could rise two to four feet above normally dry land when the center of the storm approached for a second landfall Tuesday night, The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang reported. To the east, New Orleans was under a flash flood warning Tuesday morning.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said in a news conference Tuesday to “prepare and pray.”\n\nIn Texas, the storm was still moving east, still deadly.\n\nWaves were seen lapping over Interstate-10 near Winnie, Tex., on Aug. 29 as floodwater continued to rise. (Logan Wheat)\n\nIn Beaumont, Tex., 85 miles east of Houston, at least 10 inches of rain fell on Tuesday afternoon alone. In the deluge, a mother and child got out of their car on a flooded freeway service road and were swept away. The child clung to her mother for half a mile. Police and firefighters got to them just before they went under a trestle and were lost for good. Only the child survived, police said.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency — its most severe flood alert — into Tuesday night.\n\nFlash Flood Warning including Beaumont TX, Port Arthur TX, Orange TX until 4:15 AM CDT pic.twitter.com/0LxNo474YB — NWS Lake Charles (@NWSLakeCharles) August 30, 2017\n\nAfter more than 50 inches of rain over four days, Houston was less of a city and more of an archipelago: a chain of urbanized islands in a muddy brown sea. All around it, flat-bottomed boats and helicopters were still plucking victims from rooftops, and water was still pouring in from overfilled reservoirs and swollen rivers.\n\nBetween 25 and 30 percent of Harris County — home to 4.5 million people in Houston and its near suburbs — was flooded by Tuesday afternoon, according to an estimate from Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the county flood control district. That’s at least 444 square miles, an area six times the size of the District of Columbia.\n\nAcross Houston on Tuesday, there were some new reasons for hope: The rain turned from sheets into mere drops. Fast-food outlets reopened. When a downtown convention center became a shelter for the displaced, volunteers lined up around the block to help.\n\nBut there was a realization that the storm’s most awful damage was still unknown — scattered out in those disconnected islands, or hidden under the water.\n\nMayor Sylvester Turner (D) imposed a curfew starting Tuesday from midnight to 5 a.m. Central Time to deter looting of abandoned homes.\n\n“There are some who might want to take advantage of this situation, so even before it gets a foothold in the city, we just need to hold things in check,” Turner said at a news conference.\n\nCURFEW UPDATE: I'm modifying the curfew to start at midnight (and still end at 5 am) to allow volunteers and others to do their great work. — Sylvester Turner (@SylvesterTurner) August 30, 2017\n\nAuthorities added that there had been reports of people impersonating law enforcement officers in communities such as Kingwood, falsely telling people they needed to evacuate.\n\nOn Tuesday morning authorities discovered the body of a Houston police officer who had drowned in his patrol car two days earlier, at the storm’s height. Sgt. Steve Perez, a veteran officer, was on his way to work Sunday morning — spending 2 ½ hours looking for a path through rain-lashed streets — when he drove into a flooded underpass.\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo said that Perez’s wife had asked him not to go in that day. He went, Acevedo said, “because he has that in his DNA.”\n\n[Forced from home, storm refugees fill emergency shelters]\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we announce the tragic in the line of duty death of Sergeant Steve Perez. pic.twitter.com/cHJxjnFgII — Houston Police (@houstonpolice) August 29, 2017\n\nPerez 'died in trying.' RIP, sergeant. Houston thanks you and mourns all who have died in #HarveyFlood. — Sylvester Turner (@SylvesterTurner) August 29, 2017\n\nIn all, authorities said at least 22 people had been confirmed dead from the storm. But they said it was difficult to know how many more were missing. They also said it is too early to assess the total number of homes and other buildings damaged, in part because rescue crews were still having trouble even reaching some areas because of flooded or flood-damaged roads, said Francisco Sanchez, spokesman for the Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.\n\n“We’re still in the middle of the response,” he said.\n\nAuthorities said more than 13,000 people had been rescued from floodwaters, according to the Associated Press, but that number was surely low. Many had been rescued by strangers with boats, who had rescued so many that they themselves had lost count. They left behind homes that could be flooded for days, or weeks, and perhaps lost forever.\n\nOfficials said more than 13,300 people were already in shelters. Federal authorities estimated that 30,000 people could be forced from their homes in Texas and surrounding states.\n\nAll around Houston on Tuesday, the helping and the helpless repeated the same thing.\n\nThis doesn’t happen here.\n\n“I’ve lived here since 1994, and it’s never been this high,” said Bonnie McKenna, a retired flight attendant living in Kingwood, along the raging San Jacinto River on Houston’s northeast side.\n\nMcKenna’s house was dry, but down the street rescue boats were unloading neighbors rescued from flooded streets nearby. McKenna didn’t have a boat.\n\nBut she did have a blanket.\n\nShe cut it into quarters and offered the pieces to soggy evacuees when they got off on dry land.\n\n“I’m thankful it didn’t come to my house, but I’m very sad for the people who have just lost everything,” McKenna said.\n\n[‘Formal plans will come later’: Texas Guard troops scramble to rescue civilians in the wake of Hurricane Harvey]\n\nAbout 30 miles north of the city, some people weren’t as fortunate as McKenna but they made do.\n\nAt no point was Carol Headrick scared, she said.\n\nNot when they ordered evacuations. Not when Lake Houston’s waters rose to the height of the front desk lobby at her Kingwood nursing home. Not when rescue crews told her she had to leave. And definitely not when they took her on a pontoon boat ride.\n\n“I never was scared,” Headrick said as her face, shocked by a reporter’s question morphed from one of feigned outrage to a mischievous smile. It was as though she were about to reveal some delicious secret. “I’ve got my Bible. And God promised he never was going to do this again.”\n\nThe 83-year-old woman’s lively disposition betrayed no hidden fear amid the immense loss and devastation of historic flooding in Houston brought on by Harvey this week.\n\nNo, Headrick was too busy deciphering the crackle of her old handheld AM-FM radio to be bothered with worry. She had to keep her nursing home mates informed. They sat in a U-shaped group in the center of Kingwood Bible Church’s multipurpose room chit-chatting about the Louisiana State University tigers (Headrick’s favorite team), making the most of their unusual circumstances and choosing which quilt-draped air mattress they would sleep on that night.\n\nThe residents of Arbor Terrace, a senior living facility in the now-underwater Kingwood Town Center, had little time to grab anything. Lupe Herasimchuk didn’t have time to retrieve her CPAP machine, a device that helps those with sleep apnea breathe easier. And they came only with the clothes they had on when emergency personnel arrived at the waterlogged facility.\n\n“It happened so fast,” Herasimchuk said. “I mean, I didn’t bring anything.”\n\nBut the Kingwood community made sure Herasimchuk and her neighbors were not left wanting. Neighbors from across the 14,000-acre planned community brought bundles of donations — everything from toiletries to linens and clothes, lots of it. Volunteers at the church were busy sorting out the tall piles of stuff they had received.\n\nHeadrick, she said, is pretty low maintenance. Besides her holy book, she grabbed her medicine before being led out of her third-floor apartment to a waiting rescue. She had all she needed, that is, until she spotted a pink shirt with a gold design someone had donated among the goods.\n\nShe didn’t want to have to leave: “I felt like I was safe,” Headrick said. “I felt like there was no place they take us.”\n\nBut when she saw that the floodwaters had overwhelmed the first floor of the multilevel complex — as high as five feet — Headrick went along peaceably. And gratefully, she said. Headrick was happy with the sandwiches she was given, the care from volunteers and to still be among her friends.\n\n“Last week they gave us these special glasses to watch the eclipse and who would have thought we’d be here now,” she said.\n\nHeadrick said she “lived through Alicia and all the others” referencing storms dating to 1983. “But nothing this bad before. God promised he’d never do this again.”\n\nPresident Trump flew to Texas on Tuesday, and he visited both Corpus Christi — near where the storm made landfall — and state officials in Austin. At one point, he shouted a message to a crowd outside a fire station in Corpus Christi.\n\n“This is historic, it’s epic what happened. But you know what, it happened in Texas and Texas can handle anything,” he told the crowd, which applauded his remarks and cheered more loudly when he waved the Texas state flag.\n\nThe Labor Department on Tuesday announced that it had approved an initial $10 million grant to help with cleanup efforts in Texas. Trump on Monday declared “emergency conditions” in Louisiana, where the storm was headed next.\n\nBefore Harvey struck this weekend, the biggest recorded rainstorm in the continental United States had been Tropical Storm Amelia, which dumped 48 inches on Texas in 1978 (even larger storms have been recorded in Hawaii).\n\nPresident Trump visited Texas Aug. 29, after Hurricane Harvey struck parts of the state. Here's how his predecessors handled natural disasters. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nHarvey — which drifted out of the jet stream and spun around Houston like a top — smashed the record. By Tuesday afternoon, a rain gauge near Mont Belvieu, 40 miles east of Houston, had recorded 51.9 inches of rain.\n\nOver Harris County alone, Lindner estimated that more than a trillion gallons of rain fell. That was like letting Niagara Falls run full blast onto Houston for 15 days straight.\n\nThe water rushed off the concrete of the expanding city and overwhelmed the meandering bayous that were its natural path to the sea. The hardest-hit areas were often in the south and southeast, the downstream end of the waterways.\n\nBut the water was everywhere. A map of flooded streets, compiled by the Houston Chronicle, showed a city dotted with blue. There were concentrations to the west of the city, too, where water had filled up two enormous upstream reservoirs, named Addicks and Barker, that were built to shield the city from floods like this.\n\nOfficials released water from those reservoirs to ease the pressure, but at least one of the reservoirs still overtopped its banks. More than 3,000 homes were flooded around the reservoirs.\n\nThey may remain flooded for some time. The Army Corps of Engineers said it would continue to release water from the reservoirs for weeks, to make room in case another rain comes.\n\n“We’re still in tropical storm season,” said Edmond Russo, an official with the Corps of Engineers.\n\n1 trillion gallons of rainfall has fallen in Harris County over 4 days which would run Niagra Falls for 15 days #houwx #houwx #txwx #harvey — Jeff Lindner (@JeffLindner1) August 29, 2017\n\nAcross Texas, the storm has shut down 14 oil refineries, causing damage at some that released harmful chemicals.\n\nIn Crosby, Tex., a fertilizer plant was in critical condition Tuesday night after its refrigeration system and inundated backup power generators failed, raising the possibility that the volatile chemicals on the site would explode.\n\nArkema, a maker of organic peroxides, evacuated all the personnel from the plant and was attempting to operate the facility remotely. The material must be kept at low temperatures to avoid combustion.\n\nAround the city, schools and universities were closed, with some unable to say when they would reopen.\n\nSome of the thousands of evacuees taking refuge in Houston's George R. Brown Convention Center shared videos of the shelter on social media amid Tropical Storm Harvey's record-level flooding. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe George R. Brown Convention Center downtown had taken in 10,000 people as of Tuesday morning, Turner said. That number is double the center’s anticipated capacity of 5,000. The city said it was opening two new shelters in the NRG Center, a convention center near the old Astrodome, and the Toyota Center, home of the NBA Houston Rockets.\n\nThe convention center is the landing site for all air evacuations, said Charles Maltbie, a regional disaster officer for the Red Cross, and bus evacuations are being diverted to other shelters. When asked what the center’s top capacity is, he said: “We will meet the need.”\n\n[Harvey marks the most extreme rain event in U.S. history]\n\nAbout 250 miles to the north, the city of Dallas was preparing to take at least 6,000 evacuees from the Houston area, according to Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins (D), the county’s top official. There were showers. Phone-charging stations. There was a dining hall manned by volunteers, including the Texas Baptist Men and local Israeli-American and Muslim-American groups.\n\nThe Dallas shelter was still mostly empty Tuesday because the storm was too bad to get evacuees out of Houston.\n\n“The planes are grounded, so we can’t get C-130s in” with evacuees, Jenkins said. “The roads are covered with water, so we can’t get buses in.”\n\nDallas housed 28,000 evacuees after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Jenkins said. He said he’s not sure if that many will come this time.\n\n“We don’t know what we’ll get,” he said, “until the water recedes.”\n\nHundreds of families found shelter at Wedgewood Elementary School in Friendswood, Tex., after Tropical Storm Harvey's floodwaters forced them out of their homes. (Zoeann Murphy,Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)\n\nThat was the future. In Houston on Tuesday, the city’s islands were still busy with the present.\n\nEvacuees came by helicopter, by truck, by pool float. They were brought in by the National Guard, by the fire department, by volunteers from the “Cajun Navy,” and by a crew of brewery employees who had once bought a surplus military truck on a lark and now used it to rescue their neighbors.\n\nAs the rain began to subside, and some bayous began to recede, both those who were saved — and those who did the saving — began to reflect on what comes next.\n\nOne of them was Tom Cullen, 54, who had rushed over to save his parents Sunday, as their backyard filled with water. He drove his Ford pickup until the truck couldn’t go farther, hitting hip-deep water.\n\nThen he took a one-seat kayak he’d borrowed from a neighbor. He got both his parents — ages 81 and 88 — into the kayak, then into the truck, and then safely home.\n\nCullen eventually sat down and cried.\n\n“When I think of what could have happened, reality just hit me right there,” he said, his voice breaking. “With all they have done for me since I was born, there was no way I wasn’t going over there. Anyone would do the same for their parents.”\n\nThe home his parents left behind is filled with more than four feet of water. It is still rising, he said.\n\nFahrenthold reported from Washington.

"‘White Europe’: 60,000 nationalists march on Poland’s independence day\nXenophobic phrases and far-right symbols mark event described by anti-fascists as a magnet for worldwide far-right groups\n\nTens of thousands of nationalist demonstrators marched through Warsaw at the weekend to mark Poland’s independence day, throwing red-smoke bombs and carrying banners with slogans such as “white Europe of brotherly nations”.\n\nPolice estimated 60,000 people took part in Saturday’s event, in what experts say was one of the biggest gathering of far-right activists in Europe in recent years.\n\nDemonstrators with faces covered chanted “Pure Poland, white Poland!” and “Refugees get out!”\n\n\n\nThe march organised by far-right groups in Poland is an annual event originally to mark Poland’s independence in 1918. But according to Nick Lowles, from UK anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate, it has become an important rallying point for international far-right groups.\n\n“The numbers attending this year seem to be bigger and, while not everyone on the march is a far-right activist or fascist, it is undoubtedly becoming more significant and is acting as a magnet for far-right groups around the world.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Far-right marchers brandish banners depicting a red falanga, a far-right symbol dating from the 1930s. Photograph: Janek Skarżyński/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSome participants marched under the slogan “We Want God!”, words from an old Polish religious song that the US president, Donald Trump, quoted during a visit to Warsaw earlier this year. Speakers encouraged attendants to stand against liberals and defending Christian values.\n\n\n\nMany carried the national white-and-red flag while others held banners depicting a falanga, a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s. A demonstrator interviewed by state television TVP said he was on the march to “remove Jewry from power”.\n\nPoland to Richard Spencer: keep out Read more\n\nAmong the far-right leaders attending the march was the former English Defence League leader Stephen Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, and Roberto Fiore from Italy. It also attracted a considerable number of supporters of Poland’s governing conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party.\n\nTVP, which reflects the conservative government’s line, called it a “great march of patriots”, and in its broadcasts described the event as one that drew mostly ordinary Poles expressing their love of Poland, not extremists.\n\n“It was a beautiful sight,” the interior minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said. “We are proud that so many Poles have decided to take part in a celebration connected to the Independence Day holiday.”\n\n\n\nThe march was one of many events marking Poland’s independence in 1918, when the country regained its sovereignty at the end of the first world war after being partitioned and ruled since the late 18th century by Russia, Prussia and the Austro-Hungarian empire.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Polish nationalists carry a banner translating to ‘We want God!’ during a march in Warsaw.

It’s 50 to 100,000 mostly football hooligans hijacking patriotism,” said a 50-year-old Briton, Andy Eddles, a language teacher who has been living in Poland for 27 years. “For me it’s important to support the anti-fascist coalition and to support fellow democrats, who are under pressure in Poland today.”\n\nThe conspiracy theorists who have taken over Poland | Christian Davies Read more\n\nEarlier in the day, the president, Andrzej Duda, presided over state ceremonies also attended by the European council president, Donald Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland.\n\nTusk’s appearance comes at a time when Warsaw has been increasingly at odds with Brussels because of the PiS government’s controversial interference in the courts, large-scale logging in a primeval forest and a refusal to accept migrants.

"Graphic video shows Daniel Shaver sobbing and begging officer for his life before 2016 shooting\nAfter the officer involved was acquitted of second-degree murder charges, officials in Arizona publicly released graphic video showing Daniel Shaver crawling on his hands and knees and begging for his life in the moments before he was shot and killed by police in January 2016.\n\nShaver died in one of at least 963 fatal police shootings in 2016, according to a Washington Post database. And his death was one of an increasing number of such shootings to prompt criminal charges in the years since the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Mo., following the death of Michael Brown. Yet charges remain rare, and convictions even more so.\n\nThe shooting, by Philip “Mitch” Brailsford, then an officer with the Mesa Police Department, occurred after officers responded to a call about a man allegedly pointing a rifle out of a fifth-floor window at a La Quinta Inn. Inside the room, Shaver, 26, had been doing rum shots with a woman he had met earlier that day and showing off a pellet gun he used in his job in pest control.\n\nThe graphic video, recorded by Brailsford’s body camera, shows Shaver and the woman exiting the hotel room and immediately complying with commands from multiple officers. The video was shown in court during the trial, but it was released to the public after jurors acquitted Brailsford on Thursday.\n\n[The Washington Post’s 2017 fatal police shooting database]\n\nAfter entering the hallway, Shaver immediately puts his hands in the air and lies down on the ground while informing the officer that no one else was in the hotel room.\n\n“If you make a mistake, another mistake, there is a very severe possibility that you’re both going to get shot. Do you understand?” Sgt. Charles Langley yells before telling Shaver to “shut up.”\n\n“I’m not here to be tactical and diplomatic with you. You listen. You obey,” the officer says.\n\nFor the next five minutes, officers give Shaver instructions. First, an officer tells Shaver to put both of his hands on top of his head, then he instructs him to cross his left foot over his right foot.\n\n“If you move, we’re going to consider that a threat and we are going to deal with it and you may not survive it,” Langley says.\n\nThe officer then has the woman crawl down the hallway, where she is taken into custody. Shaver remains on the ground in the hallway, his hands on his head.\n\nLangley tells Shaver to keep his legs crossed and push himself up into a kneeling position. As Shaver pushes himself up, his legs come uncrossed, prompting the officer to scream at him.\n\n“I’m sorry,” Shaver says, placing his hands near his waist, prompting another round of screaming.\n\n“You do that again, we’re shooting you, do you understand?” Langley yells.\n\n“Please do not shoot me,” Shaver begs, his hands up straight in the air.\n\nAt the officer’s command, Shaver then crawls down the hallway, sobbing. At one point, he reaches back — possibly to pull up his shorts — and Brailsford opens fire, striking Shaver five times.\n\n[Fatal shootings by police are up in the first six months of 2016, Post analysis finds]\n\nAccording to the police report, Brailsford was carrying an AR-15 rifle with the phrase “You’re F—ed” etched into the weapon. The police report also said the “shots were fired so rapidly that in watching the video at regular speed, one cannot count them.”\n\nBrailsford testified in court that he believed Shaver was reaching for a gun.\n\n“If this situation happened exactly as it did that time, I would have done the same thing,” Brailsford said during the trial. “I believed 100 percent that he was reaching for a gun.”\n\nNo gun was found on Shaver’s body. Two pellet rifles used in Shaver’s pest-control job were later found in the hotel room.\n\nAfter two days of deliberation, jurors found Brailsford not guilty of second-degree murder as well as of a lesser charge of reckless manslaughter.\n\n“The justice system miserably failed Daniel (Shaver) and his family,” said Mark Geragos, an attorney for Shaver’s widow, according to the Arizona Republic.\n\nAttorneys for the officer had petitioned to keep the video from being released, and a judge agreed to block its release to the public until after the trial had concluded.\n\nBrailsford’s attorney, Mike Piccarreta, told The Post in a previous interview that he thinks the body camera footage clears his client.\n\n“It demonstrates that the officer had to make a split-second decision when [Shaver] moved his hands toward the small of his back after being advised that if he did, he’d be shot,” Piccarreta told The Post in 2016.\n\nPiccarreta also said he wasn’t sure his client would be interested in trying to get his police job back.\n\nShaver’s widow and parents have filed wrongful-death lawsuits against the city of Mesa.\n\nKimberly Kindy contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified the officer who was shouting commands to Shaver. It was Sgt. Charles Langley.\n\nRead more:\n\nAmong thousands dead at the hands of police, few officers are prosecuted\n\nFired/Rehired: Police chiefs are often forced to put officers fired for misconduct back on the streets\n\nNumber of 2017 fatal shootings by police is nearly identical to last year","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/12/08/graphic-video-shows-daniel-shaver-sobbing-and-begging-officer-for-his-life-before-2016-shooting/","1512709200.0"
"Where did the money go? How Greece fumbled the refugee crisis\nWidad Madrati remembers the first snowfall at Oreokastro in the way most children would, as a thing of wonder. It threw a brilliant white cover over the squalor of a refugee camp pitched in the grounds of a disused warehouse in the hills above Greece’s second city, Thessaloniki. The 17-year-old Syrian did not mind that the water pipe to the outdoor sinks had frozen. She took photographs of the icicles.\n\nThe pictures on her phone show nothing of the broken chemical toilets or the discarded, inedible food; nor of the flimsy tents pitched on freezing ground by refugees, such as her family, who arrived too late to find a spot inside the concrete shell of the old warehouse. Instead, the images show children playing in the snow.\n\nStranded outside the Oreokastro buildings, in a tent dusted with white flakes, the other members of the Madrati family were more realistic about survival and begged the authorities and volunteers for a way out of the camp. A family of four when they left Aleppo, they became five along the way – Widad’s sister Maria was born in Turkey – and had endured worse indignities in Greece than pleading.\n\nThe family was among the last to leave their previous temporary home at Idomeni, close to the border with Macedonia, on the overland western Balkan route to northern Europe. They held on in the chaotic encampment for 10 weeks after Greece’s northern border closed in March 2016, in the hope that it would reopen. It did not. The settlement was evacuated and its residents moved to former industrial sites such as Oreokastro and disused army barracks. “I was crying when we left Idomeni,” says Widad. “I felt I was losing hope after so many people had crossed the border and we could not.”\n\nShe tells her story in the English she learned from volunteers at Idomeni and then taught to other refugee children at Oreokastro. Her family, who qualify by almost any criteria as refugees, have witnessed much of what has gone wrong in Greece since the country became the gateway to Europe for record numbers of refugees and migrants.\n\nFrom their arrival at Moria on Lesbos, to Idomeni and Oreokastro, the Madratis’ route since arriving in the EU has been a tour of previously obscure places in Greece that have gained international notoriety for the misery of their conditions. Their ordeal stands in stark contrast to the international funding and energy expended to help people like them.\n\nA sequence of events beginning with the record number of people who flowed into Greece in June 2015 and culminating in the photograph of drowned Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi woke the world to the refugee crisis. The effect of that awakening was to tip the entire humanitarian complex toward Greece, sending resources tumbling out of the developing world into the European Union. It prompted an unprecedented number of international volunteers to descend on the country, the UN refugee agency to declare an emergency inside the European Union, and the EU to deploy its own humanitarian response unit inside Europe for the first time. In the process, it became the most expensive humanitarian response in history, according to several aid experts, when measured by the cost per beneficiary.\n\nExactly how much money has been spent in Greece by the European Union is much reported but little understood. The online media project Refugees Deeply has calculated that $803m has come into Greece since 2015, which includes all the funds actually allocated or spent, all significant bilateral funding and major private donations.\n\nThe biggest pots of money are controlled by the European Commission (EC), the EU’s executive body, which oversees the Asylum Migration Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund (ISF) which collectively dedicated $541m to fund Greece’s costs related to border control, asylum and refugee protection. However, since it did not complete the extensive strategic planning required, the Greek government did not receive significant amounts of these funds, necessitating emergency assistance from the commission, channelled through other means. Confusion over the true extent of European spending has been exacerbated by inflated statements from the European commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, who has regularly cited figures in excess of €1bn, although this amount apparently refers to all available and theoretical funds, not what has actually been allocated or spent.\n\nOne senior aid official estimated that as much as $70 out of every $100 spent had been wasted\n\nNevertheless, the $803m total represents the most expensive humanitarian response in history. On the basis that the money was spent on responding to the needs of all 1.03 million people who have entered Greece since 2015, the cost per beneficiary would be $780 per refugee. However, the bulk of these funds was used to address the needs of at least 57,000 people stranded in Greece after the closure of the borders on 9 March 2016, and on this basis the cost per beneficiary is $14,088.\n\nOfficials from the EU’s humanitarian operations directorate, Echo, believe the payout per beneficiary was higher than any of their previous operations. One senior aid official estimated that as much as $70 out of every $100 spent had been wasted.\n\nThe haunting image of Alan Kurdi, lying drowned on a Turkish beach on 2 September 2015, was shared more than 20 million times on social media. It prompted an immediate spike in Google searches related to Syria and an avalanche of private donations to charities working on behalf of refugees.\n\nThe Swedish Red Cross saw its daily donations leap 55-fold in the week after the image circulated, according to a study led by Paul Slovic at the University of Oregon. At the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a New York-based relief group, response to the photograph crashed its website and drove a surge of public donations. Slovic says that Kurdi’s death “woke the world for a brief time”. It also made it imperative for international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) to show they were responding to events in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nFor the established groups already working in Greece, the sudden influx of funds was both welcome and destabilising. Metadrasi, a Greek organisation known for training interpreters and caring for unaccompanied minors, had experienced staff poached by bigger new arrivals on the scene that could afford far higher salaries.\n\nThe head of Metadrasi, Lora Pappa, believes the tide of money transformed refugees into “commodities” and encouraged short-term responses. “They [international organisations] were looking at how to show a presence in Greece. This led to some wasting the chance to spend constructively.”\n\nHer rueful conclusion is that “sometimes money can do more harm than good”.\n\nAmong the cautionary tales to emerge from this period was the Apanemo transit centre on Lesbos. A million-dollar facility built by the IRC on the steep hillside close to the main landing beaches during the busiest months in 2015, it was designed to receive 2,000 refugee arrivals per day. Funded by private donations, British aid money and the charitable Radcliffe Foundation, it was hailed by the IRC as a “much-needed reception centre [that] provides crucial services to refugees”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A child shelters from the rain under plastic sheeting in the refugee camp at Idomeni on Greece’s northern border, in 2016. Photograph: Vadim Ghirda/AP\n\nApanemo never ran at anything approaching capacity – partly because the refugees started landing on a different part of the island – and was mothballed in March 2016. The IRC says it has been able to dismantle materials and use them at other facilities, but the site now stands empty, while chaotic conditions elsewhere on the same island have resulted in fatalities among refugees. But the rapid deployment of resources with questionable results was in no way confined to the IRC.\n\nThe decision by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to classify the situation in Greece as an emergency turned what had been a backwater posting into a major placement almost overnight. An office with a dozen staff who had previously spent much of their time overseeing contract workers assisting the Greek asylum service expanded rapidly. The UNHCR team in Greece expanded to 600 people across 12 offices. Roughly one-third of the workforce were international staff.\n\nInternational UNHCR staff earn three times more than their local counterparts. Fotini Rantsiou, a Greek UN staff member who took a sabbatical from the organisation to volunteer, says tensions between local and international staff complicated relations within the agency. She says local staff were sidelined and “treated like secretaries” by the newly arrived international staff.\n\nThe decision to take a role in the Greek crisis also put the UNHCR on a collision course with one of the core elements of its mandate: to advocate for the rights of refugees. Operating for the first time on this scale inside the EU, which is also the organisation’s second biggest funder globally, the UNHCR faced a dilemma over criticising its donors. “Instead of advocating for the protection of refugees they remained silent for fear of the political consequences,” says Rantsiou. “Even if they wanted to criticise policy that violates their principles, they could not.”\n\nThe international organisations would work with a Greek administration that, at least in terms of its public statements, was among the most refugee-friendly in Europe. However, problems arose because many officials from the ruling Syriza party were inclined to see the well-financed foreign organisations more as colonialists than as humanitarians.\n\nThe death of Alan Kurdi: one year on, compassion towards refugees fades Read more\n\nOne senior Greek official says that he detected “a colonial mentality” among some aid workers who received hardship pay while working in the relatively comfortable environment of Greece: “It was a good job to work in a country with fine restaurants and comfortable beds and be paid like you were in Somalia.”\n\nThe resentment was fuelled by the fact that much of the funding on offer was directed via international aid agencies, not the Greek government. This was ultimately damaging, according to diplomats, Greek officials and aid workers, since the government had the role of coordinator and had final sign-off on projects. “Coordination of the response has been a key obstacle, with the UNHCR failing to work productively with the government and the government failing to make urgent, strategic decisions quickly enough,” said the UK-based charity Oxfam in a statement.\n\nMass migration is not something new to Greece. An influx of migrants from the Balkans and farther east arrived from the 1990s onwards and were largely left to fend for themselves. The most the issue merited was its own section at the Greek Ministry of the Interior. But in the last couple of years Greek migration officials have had access to one of the largest money pots administered by the European Commission, the aforementioned AMIF and ISF funds.\n\nThese funds are relatively complicated to access. They are arranged in seven-year programmes, commencing in 2014, and required Greece to set up a managing authority and develop a strategic plan. When Syriza took office it found little of this groundwork had been done by the previous conservative administration. The government, preoccupied with resolving its debt crisis, showed equally little interest in taking the first steps to access these funds. European Commission officials complained they could find no one to talk to in Athens, despite having half a billion euros potentially on offer.\n\nIt took the historic wave of refugees and migrant arrivals that crashed over the Greek islands in June 2015 to force a rethink. Some early steps were taken to establish a managing authority and submit a plan. But after a cabinet reshuffle and fresh elections these efforts were put on hold.\n\nThe reshuffle brought Ioannis Mouzalas into the role of junior minister. An obstetrician with lengthy service at the medical charity Doctors of the World, he appeared a strong choice for the role. But those hoping for a step change would be disappointed. A ministry official involved in setting up the managing authority to access European funds told the new boss that the technical preparation was important. It was explained to Mouzalas that the ministry needed to devote “a significant portion of our time to the managing authority” in order to get “a system that works”.\n\nAs the autumn of 2015 approached, Greece remained a refugee corridor, with the majority of new arrivals spending less than a week after arriving on the islands before their exit over the northern border along the western Balkans route. As hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants passed through Greece, it became obvious the country had no mechanism to compel new arrivals to apply for asylum.\n\nGreece came under considerable pressure from the EU to set up reception centres on the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos, Kos, Leros, Chios and Samos, in order to identify and fingerprint all new arrivals. In October, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, promised the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that the reception centres would be operational within a month.\n\nIn late October 2015, regional leaders converged on Brussels for a meeting to discuss the western Balkans route in an atmosphere described by one diplomat present as “scarcely concealed panic”.\n\nIt was already clear to the gathered leaders that any future plans to stem migrant flows into Europe would be contingent on Greece being able to process new arrivals, identify those in need of protection, and deport those deemed not to qualify. It was also clear to everyone that Greece was nowhere close to being able to do these things.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People at the Ellinikon refugee camp in Athens protest about the atrocious living conditions at the camp. Photograph: Nikos Pilos\n\n“Either you massively help [Greece] now or you’ll face a huge number of migrants entering the EU,” a senior UN official told the European Commission. On the sidelines of the meeting, Frans Timmermans, a vice president of the EC, admitted to the UN refugee agency that the Commission had “no idea” how to deal with the situation.\n\nBy the end of the meeting, Greece had been offered emergency funds to accommodate a total of 50,000 refugees, with the UNHCR tasked with finding places for 20,000 of these in hotels or apartments, and the remainder to be housed in camps under Greek authority.\n\nBy mid-November it was already clear that diplomatic agreements were not changing the situation on the ground. An EC team that conducted spot checks in Evros in northern Greece and on the islands of Chios and Samos reported that “nothing seems to be prepared or planned … The whole system seems to be organised to register migrants and let them leave.”\n\nA Greek policeman serving at the Moria camp put it more succinctly when explaining that his job was to get a copy of an ID and a fingerprint, and then speed new arrivals on their way to Germany: “Copy, finger, Merkel.”\n\nAfter the autumn of 2015, a Friday ritual was established. In Athens, representatives of the Greek army, police and several ministries would meet with a team from the European Commission and the UN to update them on progress. But on the second Friday of February 2016, this comfortable routine was disturbed by Maarten Verwey, the EC’s special envoy who broke the news that the border was closing. “Guys, we gave you time,” he told the meeting, according to someone present. “You didn’t prepare. Good luck. Now it’s going to happen.”\n\nWith his borders set to close, no functioning processing centres and the prospect of a grilling at a European leaders’ summit at the end of February, Alexis Tsipras found an unlikely saviour. Panos Kammenos has been one of the indisputable political winners from the upheaval in Greek politics.\n\nKammenos, a rightwinger, had been persuaded to support the leftwing government, and was rewarded with the defence ministry. Kammenos’s contribution to the refugee crisis had been to growl that Europe should back down in debt negotiations or Greece would flood the EU with migrants. When $74m was added to the annual defence ministry budget for refugee support, he saw to it that the Greek army established spartan but functional facilities where they were most needed.\n\nWith responsibility for dealing with refugees now divided between several Greek ministries and the UN, EC cash flowed and effective oversight of spending was removed. A series of amendments that passed through the Greek parliament stripped out auditing requirements on contracts related to the refugee crisis.\n\nOn 9 March 2016, the migrant trail was halted when the border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was closed. Nine days later it emerged that a deal had been agreed between the EU and Turkey, under which Greece would return newly arrived refugees and migrants, and Turkey would stem the flow of people to Europe in return for aid money and political concessions. While this was publicly received as a shock, the government in Athens had known for months what was coming.\n\nIt is a popular lament in Greece that the country has good laws but terrible governance. Another good law, law 4375/2016, was added to the statute books in April. It took the ad hoc jumble of different services across different ministries and created a single ministry of migration.\n\nOdysseas Voudouris was appointed by the prime minister to head a new general secretariat, under Mouzalas, which would do much of the groundwork, from running documentation centres to appointing camp directors. The two men had much in common: both were doctors and veterans of medical charities, in Voudouris’s case Médecins sans Frontières.\n\nWhen Mouzalas asked the new official to hold back before taking any initiatives, Voudouris initially agreed. When, six weeks later, he was still watching from the sidelines, he wrote to Mouzalas to tell him the situation could not continue.\n\nThe pair stopped speaking to each other, according to ministry officials, and started communicating by letter. Voudouris claimed that instead of a professional bureaucracy with transparent roles, Mouzalas operated an inefficient system staffed by people who lacked relevant experience. Mouzalas declined to comment for this article.\n\nThings came to a head when Voudouris arranged, with the help of the UNHCR and using $1.8m in European money, to recruit 118 contract workers to begin staffing his secretariat. In an exchange of letters, the move was blocked by Mouzalas even after a senior UN official intervened to explain that the hires would be paid for by funds that would be lost if left untapped.\n\nNikos Xydakis, who worked closely with Mouzalas throughout this period as a junior foreign minister, became increasingly concerned with how the crisis was being handled. He formed the view that there was “managerial negligence. The problems could have been addressed and we could have had a much better situation … Greece can innovate solutions. Now there is no time left for managerial negligence and short-termism.”\n\nSpeaking to state television in November 2016, Mouzalas deflected responsibility from his ministry. “It wasn’t our choice for the money to go to NGOs … this was Europe’s decision,” he said. “We are not the ones in control of this money. It is controlled by the relevant European authorities; this is the law.”\n\nWhen Imam Ali arrived at Softex, a ruined toilet paper factory downwind of an oil refinery and outside Thessaloniki in April, he slept rough outside the derelict main building. Nine months later, and still awaiting news on whether he could be reunited with his wife in the Netherlands, the 68-year-old Palestinian, who had lived in Syria, was finally moved to a weatherproof container.\n\nThe retired engineer picked up the honorary title of imam after leading prayers in a tent that residents use as a mosque. He also led a number of protests over conditions at the camp. When he was eventually granted an audience with UN officials the main thing he wanted to know was: “Who is the leader here at this camp? The police? The army? The UN? Who do we talk to?”\n\nThe imam’s experience of harsh conditions, helplessness and not knowing who to talk to was common to countless refugees. Forced to warehouse people who were determined to leave, the Greek government pursued an unlikely strategy. An archipelago of camps was spread across the country from a barren hillside above Greece’s biggest oil refinery, to the remote villages in the Pindus mountains of north-east Greece and a clutch of polluted and unsafe former industrial sites around Thessaloniki. Owing to heavy metal contamination of the water, exposed asbestos panelling and the presence of mosquitoes that can transmit malaria, the Greek Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommended their closure in July.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Imam Ali, a 68-year-old Palestinian refugee from Syria, leads prayers in the tented mosque at the Softex refugee camp outside Thessaloniki. Photograph: Nikos Pilos\n\nThe archipelago strategy placed an administrative and cost burden that the misfiring alliance of the Greek government and international organisations could not sustain. It also revealed the shocking absence of a functioning chain of command.\n\nNo one is certain exactly how many refugee camps there are in Greece. Migration ministry bulletins list 39 camps, some of which are empty. Some are closed and others are in the planning phase, but do not appear on the list. The UNHCR said there were more than 50, but did not give a specific number. The ministry declined to comment for this article.\n\nAmong the most problematic sites chosen by Mouzalas and his team was a number of privately owned warehouses including Oreokastro, where the Madrati family found themselves, the Karamanlis tannery outside Thessaloniki, and Softex. These sites lacked the basic utilities for large numbers of people.\n\nOne of the few blessings that asylum seekers did receive on arriving in Greece late in 2015 was the unusually mild weather. It is a myth that Greece has no winter – temperatures in the north can be harsh from December through February.\n\nBy late spring 2016, the larger international aid agencies were already tabling plans to winterise the tented camps and donors were allocating funds. The Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund (ASB), a German NGO, put forward a $1.6m proposal to turn Softex into a 1,500-person site with accommodation in containers, equipped with heating and plumbing. Bilateral aid money from Germany was agreed to fund the winterised camp and the proposal went to the Greek migration ministry.\n\nInstead of signing off and allowing work to begin, the ministry returned with its own proposal costed at $8m. When donors and aid agencies replied that this was a non-starter, Mouzalas refused to budge or negotiate a compromise. In a letter dated 7 July, the ministry wrote to ASB “that for Softex camp our plans will not change”. The proposal was rejected.\n\nThe fallout from the Softex standoff made it to the Greek parliament later that month: 10 MPs demanded to know how the ASB proposal had been evaluated and why it had been rejected.\n\nMeanwhile, senior officials at the UN refugee agency were receiving late-night calls from Greek ministers demanding resources, which they duly handed over, still with no sense of a plan or any proper record keeping.\n\n“Every time the government would take it right to the edge of the cliff before agreeing to anything,” says a European official familiar with the negotiations. “With the winterisation they went right over the edge.”\n\nAdding to the uncertainty was a murky game over the number of refugees within Greek borders. After the closure of the northern frontier and the implementation of the Greece-Turkey deal, arrivals slowed dramatically. When the first official count of asylum seekers remaining in Greece was released by the migration ministry, it stated that there were 57,000 on the mainland and the islands.\n\nThis number grew, with the trickle of new arrivals on the islands, to 63,000 on the official bulletin from the migration ministry. But the numbers ran counter to what European officials and NGO staff were seeing in the camps, which more and more people were leaving. At the end of July a new column appeared on the ministry report listing “refugees outside camps.” As the numbers reported in individual camps fell, the number in the new column rose.\n\nSpot-checks at camps near Thessaloniki carried out by a foreign diplomat found huge discrepancies between the official numbers and those actually present. At Oreokastro, where the official headcount was 604, there were only 135 people present. The caterers at the camp, who receive a budget of $6 per person per day – as they do at camps across the country – were well aware of the discrepancy and told the diplomat they were delivering 200 meals while continuing to receive funding based on the official figures of 600.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal reported in December that thousands of refugees counted in the official numbers were “missing”, the ministry responded that the claim was “baseless”. It was not until February that the UNHCR finally admitted that it had counted 13,000 fewer refugees than the Greek government. While it is under pressure to show it has its borders under control, Greece can not admit that thousands of refugees have been smuggled into the Balkans. The migration ministry maintains that there are more than 62,000 refugees in Greece.\n\nOn 5 January, Mouzalas tempted fate during a visit to select camps in the north by declaring the winterisation complete. “There are no longer any refugees or migrants in the cold,” he told reporters. Within days, a new cold snap was accompanied by photographs of refugees in appalling conditions, this time on the islands. Asked about cold-weather provisions, Mouzalas was defensive, saying his previous comments referred to the mainland only and that the tents may not be “four-star accommodation” but they were adequate.\n\nEntire budgets meant for the development of semi-permanent camp facilities were spent on hotel bills\n\nBefore the end of the month three asylum seekers in Moria camp on Lesbos died. Footage from the camp made it plain that some refugees and migrants were still in flimsy tents with no protection from freezing temperatures. Local witnesses suggested that the three young men died after inhaling fumes from the plastic they had scavenged and burned in a vain attempt to keep warm. Greek authorities have not yet confirmed the cause of their deaths.\n\nWhile attention focused on the remaining people in tents in the snow, a costly and desperate face-saving exercise was under way in northern Greece: transferring hundreds of refugees and migrants into seafront hotels and luxury ski chalets in the mountains above Grevena, a three-hour drive outside the city. Entire budgets meant for the development of semi-permanent camp facilities were spent on hotel bills. Aid officials confirm that temporary arrangements with hotel owners will expire this month.\n\nOne bewildered Syrian, moved from the squalor of Oreokastro, where tents were pitched in and around the concrete shell of a disused factory, found himself transported into the snowbound Vasilitsa Spa Resort, a hotel with tennis courts and fireplaces, next to a popular ski centre.\n\n“We’ve been upgraded to this place,” he wrote on Facebook. “It’s like a refrigerator.”\n\nKaterina Poutou has become an accomplished letter writer. A veteran of Greece’s suddenly crowded humanitarian field, she is the head of Arsis, one of its largest NGOs. She has waged a battle by correspondence since July 2016 with a succession of Greek ministers in a forlorn effort to secure the basic needs of 600 of the most vulnerable refugees in the country, including unaccompanied minors and lone mothers with children.\n\nThe 600 are housed in shelters run by Arsis and seven other groups that clearly qualify for AMIF funds from the European Commission that should be channelled through the Greek government. She has been forced to repeatedly beseech ministries who have been unwilling or unable to work the bureaucratic levers to ensure the necessary funds arrive.\n\nThe new ministry of migration, set up by the April 2016 law, was supposed to take over shelter needs for extremely vulnerable groups. Yet the failure of the ministries of migration and development to establish an effective managing authority and access the European funds left those taking care of vulnerable refugees in a desperate situation.\n\nThousands of refugees left in cold, as UN and EU accused of mismanagement Read more\n\n“I am not sure officials understand the consequences of the situation they have created or the humiliation this brings on the country,” says Poutou. “I have no idea why they don’t make the managing authority function. Any minister who understands the responsibilities of his mandate could have managed this if he was interested.”\n\nThe situation exploded in February when Greek asylum service workers on the islands went on strike. An asylum service email on 25 January had informed the workers that “timely payments of wages was postponed indefinitely”. Since the beginning of the year, the responsibility for paying them had been shifted by law to the migration ministry, but the bureaucracy did not exist to handle it. Seven months after law 4375/2016 passed there was still no clear plan for what it should look like.\n\nSome 40 MPs from the minister’s own party have threatened to raise the matter in parliament but for now the minister continues to enjoy the support of the prime minister. His supporters also extend far beyond Athens.\n\nAll the minister’s public statements declare unequivocal support for the EU-Turkey deal. This staunch backing for the European Commission’s key priority of slowing migration has so far shielded Mouzalas and other government figures from any serious criticism.\n\nSome critics see an even more cynical quid pro quo. The bigger the mess in Greece, the harsher the conditions, the greater the deterrent for other refugees and migrants who see the country as a route into the EU, they argue. The lavish European funding – which has been systematically overstated by the migration commissioner – offers plausible deniability of responsibility for conditions in Greece without relieving the very real problems on the ground. A spokesperson for the Commission denied that there was a deterrence strategy, insisting that it was “committed to improving conditions in Greece”.\n\nAs a Greek living and working in Paris, Dimitris Christopoulos, who heads the International Federation of Human Rights, one of the world’s oldest rights groups, has seen both sides of the issue up close. He believes the Greek government has used the mess to shield itself from the possible mass return of failed asylum seekers from elsewhere in the EU. The EC and a number of member states are keen to reinstate the Dublin Regulation, under which asylum seekers can be sent back to the country through which they first entered Europe. Christopoulos is also clear that far from weakening Mouzalas’s position with Brussels, the suffering and waste in Greece won him the “absolute support of the commission”.\n\n“The Greek administrative chaos is the best deterrence,” to others hoping to reach Europe, says Christopoulos. “It sends the message that Greece is a mess so don’t come this way.”\n\nThis article is adapted from a piece that first ran on Refugees Deeply\n\n\n\n• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/how-greece-fumbled-refugee-crisis","1489035600.0"
"A father reported his 3-year-old missing. Then he told police he’d watched her die.\nThe father of a 3-year-old Texas girl missing since Oct. 7 told police that he watched his daughter choke on milk and die, and then removed her body from the home, according to an arrest affidavit.\n\nThe graphic statements from Wesley Mathews were revealed in an arrest warrant released by police in Richardson, Tex., on Tuesday morning.\n\nMathews “had been trying to get the 3 year old girl to drink her milk in the garage” early Oct. 7, the affidavit said. “Wesley Mathews said she wouldn’t listen to him.”\n\nAt that point, Mathews said that he “physically assisted” Sherin in drinking her milk and that the girl choked on the drink.\n\n“She was coughing and her breathing slowed. Eventually, Wesley Mathews no longer felt a pulse on the child and believed she had died,” the affidavit said.\n\nThen, he told police, he removed her body from the home.\n\nMathews provided the “alternate statement of events” to detectives the day after Sherin’s body was found, Richardson police said. He has been charged with injury to a child, a first-degree felony punishable by up to life in prison, and is being held on a $1 million bond, police said.\n\n\n\nWesley Mathews. (Richardson Texas Police Department via AP)\n\nMathews had previously claimed that his adopted daughter, Sherin, went missing Oct. 7 after he sent her alone into an alley as punishment for refusing to drink her milk.\n\nBut Monday night — not long after authorities said they had “most likely” found the girl’s body — police said Mathews “voluntarily arrived at the Richardson Police Station with his attorney and asked to speak with detectives.”\n\nHe revealed the new details and was arrested.\n\n[His mother’s ashes were lost in the mail. In his search, he’s found only frustration — and fury.]\n\nOn Tuesday, police said they used dental records to confirm the body was Sherin’s.\n\nHer body was discovered by officers and search dogs examining a culvert near Spring Valley and Bowser roads, less than a mile from the family’s home in the suburb of 100,000 about 15 miles north of Dallas.\n\nRichardson Police Chief Jimmy Spivey vowed to bring to justice whomever is responsible.\n\nMonday’s arrest was Mathews’s second in the case. He was arrested on child abandonment and endangerment charges the day Sherin went missing but had been released on bail.\n\nAs part of his bail condition, he was required to surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitoring bracelet so authorities could track him at all times, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nEarlier Monday, Mathews and his wife, Sini, attended a court hearing to determine whether they could regain custody of their biological daughter.\n\nThe 4-year-old had been taken into custody by Child Protective Services and placed in foster care after Sherin was reported missing. The judge postponed the hearing until Nov. 13 to give Mathews time to hire a civil attorney, a spokeswoman for CPS told the Associated Press.\n\n“We do have the names of some relatives who have expressed interest in taking care of her,” said the spokeswoman, Marissa Gonzales. “We can begin looking into those relatives, but it is entirely up to the judge where she is placed.”\n\n[A teenage girl was ‘brainwashed’ before she was abducted by her teacher, her father says]\n\nAfter the hearing, the father’s attorney, Rafael De La Garza, told the Dallas Morning News that his client was “mourning the death of his child.” De La Garza did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe murky details of Sherin’s disappearance have transfixed the Dallas area for most of this month.\n\nHer father originally told investigators that he looked outside 15 minutes after he sent Sherin into the alley but that she was gone, according to police affidavits.\n\nNot yet too worried, the father said, he then did a load of laundry, according to the affidavit. He waited until after sunrise before he reported the disappearance to police. They began searching for the 22-pound girl last seen wearing a pink top, black pajama bottoms and pink flip-flops.\n\nDetectives and FBI agents searched the Mathews house midweek and subsequently announced that someone left in the family’s sport-utility vehicle about 4 a.m. on the day she disappeared. That vehicle returned home within the hour, they said.\n\nPolice said Sherin’s mother was asleep during the incident and has not been charged. Her attorney said she has cooperated with authorities in trying to help identify Sherin’s body.\n\nMathews and his wife adopted Sherin about two years ago from an orphanage in India, said Sgt. Kevin Perlich, a Richardson police spokesman. Mathews told police that Sherin was malnourished and had to be on a special diet to gain weight.\n\nHerman Wong contributed to this post.\n\nRead more:\n\nThese middle school students pretended to rape black classmates on Snapchat\n\nPolice used a Taser on a grandfather, who’s now in intensive care.

"Massive fire engulfs London high-rise, leaves at least 12 dead\nA massive fire engulfed a residential high-rise building in London on Wednesday, leaving at least 74 people injured and 12 dead.\n\nInterested in London? Add London as an interest to stay up to date on the latest London news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe London Fire Brigade dispatched at least 40 fire engines, 20 ambulance crews and more than 200 firefighters in an effort to battle the conflagration, at the 24-story Grenfell Tower in West London.\n\nAuthorities said they are monitoring the stability of the charred structure, but that firefighters have managed to search 'most' of the building for remaining people.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service confirmed the rising death toll at a press conference Wednesday night.\n\n'This is an unprecedented incident,' London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton told reporters. 'In my 29 years of being a firefighter, I have never, ever seen anything of this scale.'\n\nAs of 11:45 a.m. local time Wednesday, 64 people were transported to six hospitals across London for a range of injuries related to the fire, and 20 of them are in critical condition. An additional 10 people made their own way to hospitals, bringing the total of those treated to 74, according to London Ambulance Service director of operations Paul Woodrow.\n\n'Over 100 of our medics have been working hard to respond to this incident, including ambulance crews, advanced paramedics, advanced trauma teams from London's Air Ambulance and those staff managing the incident in our special operations center,' Woodrow said in a statement late Wednesday morning. 'Our hazardous area response teams are also on scene, who carry specialist equipment, including breathing apparatus. We've been treating patients for a range of injuries as well as for smoke inhalation.'\n\nVictoria Jones/PA via AP Photo\n\nIt is not known yet what caused the blaze, which firefighters continue to battle. The fire has left the building almost totally charred, and there were fears in the morning about the building's structural integrity, as it appeared to lean slightly to one side.\n\nThe tower, built in 1974, contains 120 apartments, according to its management company, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation.\n\nOne resident told ABC News that he woke up smelling smoke and thought his laptop was overheating. He said it seemed as if the fire had been burning for at least 30 minutes before the building's fire alarms went off.\n\nThe resident, who said he was initially told to stay in place, said he fled the building once he realized how thick the smoke was. Regrettably, he said, he was unable to carry his elderly father and fears that he may not have survived.\n\nLondon Fire Brigade Assistant Commissioner Dan Daly said in a statement that 'firefighters wearing breathing apparatus are working extremely hard in very difficult conditions to tackle this fire. This is a large and very serious incident, and we have deployed numerous resources and specialist appliances.'\n\nMatt Dunham/AP Photo\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was 'truly devastated' and warned that the numbers of dead and injured could increase.\n\n'My heart goes out to everyone affected. I am sad to confirm that we now know there have been fatalities and more than 50 people have been taken to hospitals,' he said in a statement early Wednesday. 'The fire service is dealing with a rapidly changing situation and these numbers [of dead and injured] are likely to rise.'\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service said that at 1:16 a.m. local time it received 'reports of a large fire at a block of flats in the Lancaster West Estate, W11.'\n\nSome social media users posted photos and videos of the fire as it continued to rage after sunrise, and others posted images of loved ones who are unaccounted for.\n\n'It looks very bad, very, very bad. I've never seen anything like this. It's just such a big fire,' Tim Downey, an eyewitness, told the BBC early Wednesday. 'It has burned through to its very core.'\n\nHe said part of the building appeared to be 'completely burned away.'\n\n'The whole building is just crumbling. It's just billowing black smoke,' Downey said.\n\nAnother witness, Hanan, who gave only her first name, told ABC News that she managed to escape from the building's ninth floor and that she was worried about her brother, Abdul Aziz, and his family, who were on the 26th floor.\n\nSome tenants previously complained about the upkeep of the tower, specifically warning about the fire risk. In November a residents' group, Grenfell Action Group, said that only a 'catastrophic event' would expose the concerns it had about the building's landlord, according to a blog post from the group.\n\nABC News' Molly Hunter, Alexandra Faul and Joseph Simonetti contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/fire-engulfs-london-high-rise-400-fire-engines/story?id=48020634","None"
"CDC: Half Of All Female Homicide Victims Are Killed By Intimate Partners\nCDC: Half Of All Female Homicide Victims Are Killed By Intimate Partners\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ross D. Franklin/AP Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nMore than half of female homicide victims were killed in connection to intimate partner violence — and in 10 percent of those cases, violence shortly before the killing might have provided an opportunity for intervention.\n\nThat is according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published Thursday, that takes a close look at the homicides of women.\n\nLoading...\n\nMore than 55 percent of the deaths were related to partner violence, and the vast majority of those were carried out by a male partner.\n\n'What's notable is that this is across all racial ethnic groups,' says Emiko Petrosky, a science officer at the CDC and an author of the report. 'Intimate partner violence can affect anyone ... it really just shows that [this] is a public health problem.'\n\nThe report also found that black and indigenous women are slain, in general, at significantly higher rates than women of other races. Black women are killed at a rate of 4.4 per 100,000 people, and indigenous women at a rate of 4.3 per 100,000; every other race has a homicide rate of between 1 and 2 per 100,000.\n\nHispanic women who were killed, meanwhile, were the most likely to be killed in connection to partner violence (61 percent of all homicides of Hispanic women).\n\nIt's a well-established fact that a large percentage of female homicide victims are killed by intimate partners. Worldwide, the World Health Organization says a partner or spouse is the killer in 38 percent of women's homicides. Previous research in the U.S. suggested that intimate partners carried out more than 40 percent of homicides of women and about 7 percent of homicides of men.\n\nBut the new report drew on coroner's reports and death certificates, as well as crime data. It gives an even higher percentage — and provides a much more granular look at women's deaths.\n\nThe CDC examined more than 10,000 homicides between 2003 and 2014. In female homicides in which the circumstances are known, the killer was a current or former intimate partner about half of the time, the report found. The number of killings related to partner violence rose to 55 percent if you include other kinds of victims.\n\n'This can include family members who may have tried to step in to prevent an intimate partner violence incident that was happening,' Petrosky says. 'This could include bystanders, even, that just were at the wrong place at the wrong time.'\n\nMore than 98 percent of those homicidal partners were men. (In general, men are more likely to be involved in a homicide than women. Seventy-seven percent of homicide victims are men, according to the FBI, while more than 90 percent of known offenders are male.)\n\nOf slain women of reproductive age, about 15 percent were pregnant or had recently given birth; the CDC suggests more research to determine whether that is higher than the general population.\n\nThe report was meant to find information that could help prevent such homicides — for example, by focusing programs on women who are at the highest risk of being killed.\n\nFor example, the researchers note that patterns of nonlethal domestic violence — referred to as IPV, or intimate partner violence — could be used to prevent homicides.\n\nFirst responders could assess risk factors for violence to 'facilitate immediate safety planning and to connect women with other services, such as crisis intervention and counseling, housing, medical and legal advocacy,' the report says.\n\n'We found that approximately one in 10 victims of intimate-partner-violence-related homicide experienced some form of violence in the preceding month,' Petrosky says. 'And when we look at it for the non-intimate-partner-violence-related homicides, that was less than 2 percent. So this indicates that there could have been potentially an opportunity for intervention for those women.'\n\nThe report also analyzed the method of homicide — more than half involved firearms and 20 percent involved some sort of blade.\n\nStatutes limiting firearm access for people who are under domestic violence restraining orders can also help reduce the risk of homicide, the report suggests.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/21/538518569/cdc-half-of-all-female-murder-victims-are-killed-by-intimate-partners","1500609600.0"
"A Generation in Japan Faces a Lonely Death\nMr. Kinoshita lived in a ground-floor “2DK” apartment — two rooms and a dine-in kitchen. Piles of old clothes, boxes, books, newspapers, empty food containers and heaps of trash blanketed the floor. A single open trail led from the bed to the toilet, passing by the only clean item in the apartment: a white T-shirt hanging from a shelf, still wrapped in the dry cleaner’s plastic.\n\nMr. Kinoshita was 83. His legs had grown weak. He used a “silver chair” that he rolled in front of him to steady himself. He left his apartment perhaps once a week.\n\nAfter Mrs. Ito saw the state of his apartment, she alerted community leaders. Men who lived alone in the danchi, weakened by age and infirmity in apartments like that, were the most vulnerable. She learned that volunteers were already keeping an eye on him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMonths ago, after he had not been seen for a week, a volunteer went knocking on his door. There was no answer, but she could hear the television from inside. Thinking he was dead, the volunteer called the police. When Mr. Kinoshita finally woke up from a deep sleep, he was a little embarrassed, yet also relieved and maybe even a little happy that his existence had figured into someone’s thoughts.\n\n“Thanks for your kindness,” Mr. Kinoshita liked to say in English, perhaps avoiding sentiments that were too hard to express in Japanese.\n\nHe had left Tokyo in his late 60s and moved into Tokiwadaira 14 years ago, just as the lonely deaths were becoming common. The year he moved in, Tokiwadaira recorded 15 of them. Today, volunteers have managed to reduce them to about 10 a year.\n\nMr. Kinoshita had lost everything before coming to the danchi. He had lost his company to bankruptcy and also the money he had borrowed from his sisters and brothers, who told him, “You’re the one who’s ruined the Kinoshita clan.” He had lost his house, and his second wife, who told him, “There’s no use staying with a husband who’d sell away our house.”\n\nIt would have been easy to see Mr. Kinoshita as just another victim of the collapse of Japan’s economic bubble. His company, I Love Industry, which worked as a subcontractor on underground construction projects — the “tail of a mouse,” he said — had ridden the country’s construction boom from the 1960s through the 1990s until public works contracts dried up.\n\nYet he had also enjoyed a moment of glory, one that he clung to the way Mrs. Ito clung to the Tokiwadaira in her books. During the construction of the Channel Tunnel, he had supplied a major contractor, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, with equipment — a reel for a hose — to help bore under the Strait of Dover.\n\nMr. Kinoshita’s large eyes lit up as he brought out his old business card, sketches of the equipment he had provided and photos of himself in his heyday: at a celebration at Kawasaki’s headquarters; on site under the Dover Strait; visiting tourist attractions in Paris during his sole visit to Europe.\n\nThere were talismans — a Eurotunnel key holder, which he held between his fingers and showed people, without ever letting go, as if he were afraid of losing it. He had commemorative medals of the tunnel’s construction, a rock fragment encased in plastic, and the T-shirt carefully preserved in dry-cleaning wrap. It had a blue and red circle with “Euro Tunnel” inside.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom his foray in Europe, he had brought back a habit of sprinkling some French words into his speech, on top of the broken English he had picked up decades earlier from a college friend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“All over Paris, I kept hearing, ‘Merci madame,’ ” he said. “I couldn’t wait to go back to Tokyo and say, ‘Merci madame.’ ”\n\nMr. Kinoshita took out a large black-and-white shot of himself in his 20s, working in a rice warehouse. Wearing only a loincloth that emphasized his sinewy frame and rodlike legs, he carried three rice bags on his shoulders, totaling 400 pounds. “When I was young,” he said in English.\n\nHe was born in Taiwan, part of Japan’s colonial empire back then. His family returned after World War II to southwestern Japan, where he ate the frogs he caught in rice fields. Even in the family’s poverty and his nation’s defeat, the adolescent Kinoshita caught glimpses of a bright future in Japan’s energy and youth.\n\n“My generation had dreams,” said Mr. Kinoshita, who went on to study mechanical engineering.\n\nHe had never imagined that his decline — and Japan’s — could be so rapid. Corporate giants like Sharp were now being taken over by a company in Taiwan, Japan’s former colony, he said with bewilderment. In 2011, when Japan was hit by a terrible earthquake and tsunami, Mr. Kinoshita rose to his feet and steadied a cabinet from toppling over. Since then, the same legs that had supported the bags of rice could barely uphold his shrinking body.\n\nThe world he knew had shrunk. He went to a health club until last year. Sitting in the Jacuzzi helped his legs, and he liked it when women came into the tub. But one day he passed out in the Jacuzzi and an ambulance was called. He came to, refused to get into the ambulance, and never returned to the health club. Now, he went out only a few times a month — to the supermarket, or to the monthly lunches where he shared a table with Mrs. Ito.\n\nHis friendship with “Madame Ito” gave him energy, though she was the one who did most of the talking. “She’s very assertive, to the point where I can’t get a word in,” he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He brought back Hershey’s chocolate bars for Mrs. Ito and for the volunteer who had come knocking on his door. Mr. Kinoshita called her “Madame Eleven.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was hoping to make copies of his Eurotunnel T-shirt for Madame Ito and Madame Eleven.

"I-85 collapse: Bond set at $200,000 for arson suspect in Atlanta highway fire\nAtlanta (CNN) The man accused of arson in a fire that collapsed part of an elevated interstate in Atlanta, triggering what's expected to be months of traffic headaches in one of the nation's most congested cities , is being held on $200,000 bond, a Fulton County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office spokeswoman said Saturday.\n\nBasil Eleby is charged with first-degree arson and first-degree criminal damage to property, spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said. He is due in court next on April 14.\n\nEleby and two others -- all believed by investigators to be homeless -- were arrested in connection with Thursday evening's fire under Interstate 85, Jay Florence, the state's deputy insurance and safety fire commissioner, said Friday.\n\nThe fire started in a state-owned storage lot under the highway, causing part of northbound I-85 to collapse and also damaging the southbound portion, forcing the closure of all five lanes in each direction for the foreseeable future. No one was injured\n\nInvestigators believe Eleby started the fire intentionally and that Sophia Bruner and Barry Thomas, who both were charged with trespassing, were with him, Florence said. Only Eleby was jailed overnight Friday, said Sgt. Cortez Stafford, a Atlanta Fire Rescue Department spokesman.\n\nFlorence didn't say how investigators came to suspect the three or say anything about a motive. Neither did he say how the fire started.\n\nFlames rise Thursday evening along an elevated stretch of Interstate 85 north of downtown Atlanta.\n\nWhat was under the highway?\n\nThe region, already accustomed to gridlock, is struggling to face its new commuting reality. It will take 'at least several months' to rebuild the collapsed and otherwise damaged portions of I-85, Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry said.\n\nThe closure comes as hordes of spring break vacationers are poised to drive though the region's urban hub.\n\nThe fire ignited in a fenced-in area under the expressway where the state stores construction materials, McMurry said. Those materials include HDPE -- high-density polyethylene -- pipes used in the 'traffic management, cabling, fiber-optic and wire network,' he said.\n\nSections of northbound and southbound I-85 will have to be replaced -- 350 feet in both directions.\n\nThe material had been stored there 'for some time, probably since 2006 or (2007),' McMurry said.\n\nHDPE pipes encase and protect cables, and are widely used in the transportation industry to build 'smart' highways that provide information to drivers, control traffic signal lights and tollways. The pipes are also used in the distribution of natural gas and by telecommunication companies such as AT&T and Google Fiber.\n\nI-85 collapse: By the numbers 220,000-plus: Estimated number of cars that drive through that stretch of I-85 daily 6:12 p.m. ET Thursday: Atlanta firefighters get first call about the fire Around 7 p.m.: Part of the interstate collapses 40 feet: Height of the wall of fire 350 feet: Length of the sections of I-85 that need to be replaced in each direction 50%: Traffic increase on the I-285 bypass the day after the collapse\n\nThe flammability of HDPE is relatively low, Tony Radoszewski, president of the Plastics Pipe Institute , a trade group based in Irving, Texas, told CNN. HDPE would have to be exposed to a high-temperature flame for a considerable amount of time to burn, he said.\n\n'Somebody had to start a fire. It doesn't combust by itself, it needs fuel,' Radoszewski told CNN. 'Someone had to do it. It's not like someone would have dropped a match and it started.'\n\nInvestigators are still working to determine how the fire started.\n\n'We're as eager to learn the cause of this fire as anyone,' McMurry said.\n\nWhen you're just trying to get home and Atlanta is on fire again. #hotlanta A post shared by Jono Moore (@jonoism) on Mar 30, 2017 at 3:38pm PDT\n\nFew hydrants, extreme heat\n\nFirefighters were alerted at 6:12 p.m. Thursday to the blaze under I-85 in northeast Atlanta, north of the highway's split with I-75.\n\nThey rushed to the scene and fought the flames at street level as motorists on the elevated interstate drove through thick black smoke billowing up from below.\n\nSoon, a massive fireball engulfed the overpass.\n\n'There was a 40-feet or higher wall of fire. Power lines were falling and arcing heavily and falling in the streets,' Stafford, the fire department spokesman, told CNN.\n\nFirefighters first battled the blaze using water from tanker trucks because the area has few hydrants, he told CNN.\n\nBut the conflagration wasn't dying fast enough. So fire officials summoned two fire trucks from an outpost of the city's fire department at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, some 22 miles away.\n\nFirefighters battle the fire that eventually led to the collapse of part of I-85 in northeast Atlanta.\n\nThose trucks -- which carry especially powerful hose nozzles and 3,000 gallons each of a water-foam mixture -- combined efforts with resources already on the ground, Stafford said.\n\nAs they fought the flames, concrete began falling from under the bridge, he said. Firefighters were asked to step back.\n\n'Not even two minutes later,' around 7 p.m., he said, 'the highway fell with a big 'kaboom.' (It) knocked our guys back.'\n\nBy that time, the incident had halted traffic. And though the highway -- which carries more than 220,000 cars per day -- is normally jammed with cars at that hour, no one was hurt.\n\nAmid the rubble of the fallen pavement, firefighters continued their work. Owing to the extra volume of water from the airport trucks -- not the addition of the foam they carried -- the fire was brought under control, Stafford said.\n\nSurreal scenes\n\nSocial media users posted surreal images showing motorists -- before the collapse -- choosing to drive into the black smoke that wafted onto the highway as the fire burned beneath them.\n\nCNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin was driving north on I-85 during the evening rush hour when he saw smoke rising from underneath the elevated highway.\n\nPulled up to fire on Interstate 85, minutes before highway collapsed.

McLaughlin (@EliottCNN) March 31, 2017\n\nMany cars on the left side of the five-lane section barreled through the thick black smoke. They disappeared into the darkness as they drove, he said.\n\nMcLaughlin slowly followed the taillights of an SUV through the smoke.\n\nSoon, interstate traffic was stopped and turned around, creating long jams.\n\nCrews work Friday on a section of I-85 that collapsed during a masive fire.\n\n'Transportation crisis' looms\n\nThree sections of northbound I-85 -- including the part that collapsed -- and three sections of southbound I-85 will have to be replaced, McMurry told reporters Friday afternoon. That's 350 feet of highway -- nearly a football field -- in each direction, he said, adding that demolition of these sections started Friday and will last into Monday.\n\nUse MARTA or other commute options.

"Inside the scandal-hit world of Japan's sumo wrestlers\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sumo wrestler Harumafuji sorry for 'causing trouble'\n\nStanding resolute amid a frenzy of flashbulbs, the damp-eyed warrior announced his immediate retirement.\n\n'I apologise from my heart,' he declared, bowing deeply for almost 30 seconds.\n\nHarumafuji - his fighting name - was a sumo grand champion, known in Japanese as 'yokozuna', until last Wednesday. On 25 October, he allegedly attacked a younger wrestler in a bar and fractured the man's skull, provoking weeks of headlines and a police investigation.\n\nThe case has cast a cloud over Japan's ancient national sport, and it's far from the first time. A decade ago, its reputation plunged when a 17-year-old trainee died after his elders beat him with a beer bottle and a baseball bat.\n\nIn 2010, an illegal betting ring with alleged links to Japan's yakuza gangsters struck another blow. Harumafuji's mentor, the great Mongolian champion Asashoryu, resigned the same year after a drunken brawl outside a Tokyo nightclub.\n\nThen evidence of match-fixing emerged in sumo's second division.\n\nAre these signs that sumo is dying in its homeland, the discipline that once defined it in tatters? Or is it just that after 15 centuries, the dark side finally makes the papers?\n\n'The Mongolians are coming!'\n\nTo answer those questions, it helps to look at where sumos come from - and the savage training regime that shapes them.\n\nThough sumo originated in Japanese temple rites performed some 1,500 to 2,000 years ago, the nation no longer dominates in the ring. Until this week's departure, there were four sumo grand champions. Three of them, Harumafuji included, are Mongolian.\n\nEastern Europe, Russia, Hawaii and Samoa all send promising wrestlers to the Japanese sumo 'stables' - effectively a men's boarding house where 'stable masters' drill surly teenagers in the arts that once thrilled the imperial courts.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Harumafuji performs the ring-entering rite during New Year celebrations in Tokyo\n\nIn the land of the rising sun, sumo isn't just a sport - it's a ceremonial window on the past, steeped in tradition and what it means to be Japanese. Strict rituals set out the code of behaviour, and being born overseas is no excuse for slacking.\n\nAll sumos must wear traditional dress in public, including a Samurai-inspired topknot. At tournaments, triumph and disaster should be greeted with equal impassivity. In conversation, the wrestler must be a model of softly-spoken humility and behave with 'hinkaku' - dignity. Their status is such that strangers will bow when they walk down the street.\n\nEach of the 45 stables can accept just one foreigner (or 'gaikokujin') at a time, by order of the highly conservative Japan Sumo Association.\n\nAnd when they get there, often just 15 and no older than 23 - it's time to eat, speak, fight, dress and breathe Japanese.\n\nCooking, cleaning - and nothing for breakfast\n\n'They're like a very junior soldier in basic training,' explains sumo expert Mark Buckton, a former commentator and columnist with the Japan Times.\n\n'So they're doing the cooking, the cleaning, peeling the potatoes… And everyone learns Japanese, everyone does.'\n\nImage copyright Junko Kimura/Getty Images Image caption A sumo wrestler dishes up chanko-nabe, a protein-rich stew\n\nThe stable is run under a strict hierarchy, with the stable master - a former wrestler - at the top.\n\n'It's not like football where you can transfer from Manchester United to another team,' Mr Buckton told the BBC. 'You are in that stable for life. The only way to leave is to leave sumo.'\n\nEvery wrestler grows his hair long, often to the mid back, so the stable's resident hairdresser can arrange it into the historic styles. It's washed only every week or two, and slicked with bintsuke oil - whose sweet smell accompanies the wrestler everywhere.\n\nMeals, often a meaty hotpot with veg, are as strictly controlled as the training - where youngsters spend hours trying to push huge men across a sand-covered ring.\n\n'They do eat a lot,' says Mr Buckton. 'But what they do which is crucial to them is, as soon as they've eaten they go to sleep. They don't eat anything for breakfast - they do all the training in the morning. They eat their lunch - they would have what you would have, maybe a bit more. But they would just eat it with large volumes of rice. Crucially they will then go to bed. They won't wake up till mid-afternoon.\n\n'Then they'll eat again in the evening - they'll eat a lot. And then they'll go to bed quite early, because they'll be up at 5, 6 o'clock in the morning training.'\n\nImage copyright Junko Kimura/Getty Images Image caption Sumo wrestlers take part in a training session\n\nDo stricter stables tend to produce better fighters?\n\n'Definitely. Definitely.'\n\nNo to salaries, girlfriends and phones\n\nThere are six professional sumo tournaments a year, all held in Japan. Promotion through the ranks comes from winning more than you lose, and a wrestler wins by forcing his opponent out of the ring, or making him touch the ground with anything except his feet.\n\nSome 650 fighters make up the six divisions, but only about 60 are in the top tier. The bottom four divisions are all unpaid. A very gifted fighter might take two or three years to reach the dizzying goal of a salary.\n\nWhen it comes, it's pretty good. Around $12,000 (£8,900) a month in division two, and perhaps $60,000 a month at the top, including sponsorship deals.\n\nImage copyright Uriel Sinai/Getty Images Image caption Sumo dress can prove eye-catching when the fighters travel overseas\n\nThere are plenty of starker incentives, however.\n\nJunior wrestlers are meant to wear a thin cotton yukata [robe] and geta [wooden sandals] even in the depths of winter.\n\nDriving is not allowed, but the best fighters have drivers. A status symbol and a necessity, because their stomachs make it hard to reach the steering wheel.\n\nMobile phones and girlfriends are technically banned below divisions 1 and 2, the sekitori ranks, though some leniency is creeping in. Women cannot live at the stables, and a fighter can't marry and live outside with his wife unless he reaches at least the second division.\n\nWorse still, if he is injured and drops into the third division, he must leave his wife and children behind and move back into the stable.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Young sumo Musashikuni and stable master Musashimaru explain what the life of a sumo involves\n\nWhat happens if the young men don't meet their masters' standards, or rail against the relentless, almost monastic regime?\n\n'Oh, they are horrible,' confirms Mr Buckton. 'Before the boy was killed in 2007 there were regular beatings. You'd see guys with welts on their backs and on the backs of their legs, for not trying hard enough.'\n\nLast year, reports claim, a wrestler was awarded nearly 32.4 million yen (£214,000; $288,000) after daily mistreatment left him blind in one eye.\n\nThe grand champion Hakuho, a Mongolian from the capital, Ulan Bator, gave a shocking account of this 'kawaigari' or 'doting' - a euphemism for violent beatings lasting up to 45 minutes.\n\nHe spoke out after 17-year-old Takashi Saito was beaten to death following threats to run away from his stable.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Hakuho, a much-loved champion, has spoken frankly about the beatings he endured\n\n'You may look at me now and see that I have a happy face, but at that time I was crying every day,' Hakuho said. 'The first 20 minutes are just so painful. But after that it becomes easier, because even as you're being beaten up you start to feel less pain.\n\n'Of course I cried, and when my elder told me that 'it's for your own good,' I cried again.'\n\nBreaking the code of secrecy\n\nWhy would a sport that subjects its greatest talents to a rigorous, years-long course of corporal punishment force Harumafuji into retirement for hitting a junior wrestler?\n\n'Well, he beat him in a bar...' Mark Buckton observes. And therein lies the problem.\n\nSumo writer Chris Gould, who has followed the sport for three decades, says its code of silence is strong.\n\n'There is remarkable consistency in how the training, and the punishments, have been applied across the different stables and over the decades. This also means that when Harumafuji-style incidents happen, you don't talk about them for the sake of preserving the group.\n\n'It's interesting to see the injured wrestler's coach, Takanohana, being criticised by some for speaking out of turn and breaking the secrecy rule. In most other sports he'd be lauded as a whistleblowing hero.'\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Harumafuji (R) and his stable master Isegahama bow in apology during a press conference\n\nWith this sort of attitude, can sumo really expect young sportsmen to keep filling its ranks?\n\nThe days when the promise of two square meals a day would draw in broke, hungry recruits from big rural families are mercifully past in modern Japan, and other sports like football and baseball offer better salaries without the risk of violence.\n\nBut despite all this, sumo is enjoying a popularity boost. Back in January, Japan got its first home-grown grand champion in almost two decades, to the absolute joy of fans.\n\nThe Japan Sumo Association is also playing its part with a smart publicity drive.\n\nIn Mr Gould's view, doom-mongering about sumo's decline is premature.\n\n'It's not time to panic about the future yet. But the sumo association needs to spell out what sumo is for, what it is against, and the core values that bind it together. Unless that happens, the numbers of great wrestlers who never applied will continue to increase.'","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42178483","None"
"Idaho Leads U.S. As Fastest Growing State, Census Bureau Reports\nIdaho Leads U.S. As Fastest Growing State, Census Bureau Reports\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Litchfield/AP Charlie Litchfield/AP\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Oregon Trail fur traders, Americans are again flocking to the West in great numbers, according to new data from the U.S. Census Bureau. But of course, this time they aren't making the journey in covered wagons.\n\nIdaho saw its population jump by 2.2 percent from July 1, 2016 to July 1, 2017, leading the nation as the fastest growing state. Three other western states saw similar growth during that same period: Nevada, Utah and Washington. The overall U.S. population also grew by 2.3 million.\n\nThis is the first time in at least a decade that Idaho has topped the list as the fastest growing state, says Molly Cromwell, a demographer with the Census Bureau.\n\n'Domestic migration is the primary factor driving that population growth. We're also seeing that in Nevada,' she tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson. 'But in Utah, which is the third fastest growing state this year, natural increase — or more births than deaths — is a driving factor.'\n\nStates in the South and West continued to lead in population growth, as more people move away from the Northeast and Midwest, Cromwell says. Thirty eight percent of the U.S. population now resides in the South, while 23.8 percent lives in the West.\n\n'Both the West and the South saw a 1 percent growth in 2017,' she says. 'But while the South had more than twice as much growth from migration than the West, it's because the population was almost twice as large.'\n\nIn Idaho, the economy is a major driver of population growth, which the state's department of labor estimates will continue to increase at an annual rate of 1.4 percent through 2025. The state's unemployment rate is below the national average at 2.9 percent.\n\nIdaho is also booming with out-of-state transplants who are arriving to work in the state's developing tech sector. Between 2014 and 2015, Idaho had the second-fastest growing tech industry behind Utah, according to a report by CompTIA, a non-profit trade organization for the information technology industry.\n\nMost of the tech industry is based in Idaho's capital of Boise. Long dismissed as flyover country, the lower cost of living in Boise has boosted the city's cultural cachet, drawing comparisons to Portland, Ore., and Austin, Texas. But that growth is pushing housing prices up, Harrison Berry of Boise Weekly told Hobson in August.\n\n'That's creating a real pinch for people who live and work near downtown,' he says. 'The people who sling your coffee are kind of being pushed to the outskirts, while some of those rentals and for-sale homes are being scooped up by people with more disposable income.'\n\nEconomic data provides a clue into the reason for domestic migration. Eight states lost population this year, with Illinois and West Virginia losing residents at the fastest rate, Cromwell says.\n\nIn Illinois, residents are leaving due to the state's budget crisis. Moody's Investor's Service estimates the state owes more than $250 billion in public pension debt. In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, which is working to restructure its $120 billion debt, the population dropped from 3.4 million in 2016 to 3.3 million this year. However, those numbers are likely higher due to the mass exodus following Hurricane Maria.\n\nCromwell also says that the nation's population growth rate is slowing down, in part due to an increase in the number of deaths.\n\nAccording to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the country's average life expectancy dropped in 2016 for the second year in a row. A leading reason for the decline is a 21 percent increase in drug overdose deaths, many of them related to the opioid crisis.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/21/572591681/idaho-leads-u-s-as-fastest-growing-state-census-bureau-reports","1513832400.0"
"Mystery of sonic weapon attacks at US embassy in Cuba deepens\nAt least some of the incidents were confined to certain rooms with laser-like specificity, and some victims now have problems recalling specific words\n\nThe blaring, grinding noise jolted the American diplomat from his bed in a Havana hotel. He moved just a few feet, and there was silence. He climbed back into bed. Inexplicably, the agonizing sound hit him again. It was as if he’d walked through some invisible wall cutting straight through his room.\n\n\n\nBotched surveillance job may have led to strange injuries at US embassy in Cuba Read more\n\nSoon came the hearing loss, and the speech problems, symptoms both similar and altogether different from others among at least 21 US victims in an astonishing international mystery still unfolding in Cuba. The top US diplomat has called them “health attacks”.\n\n\n\nNew details learned by the Associated Press indicate at least some of the incidents were confined to specific rooms or even parts of rooms with laser-like specificity, baffling US officials who say the facts and the physics don’t add up.\n\n\n\n“None of this has a reasonable explanation,” said Fulton Armstrong, a former CIA official who served in Havana long before America re-opened an embassy there. “It’s just mystery after mystery after mystery.”\n\nSuspicion initially focused on a sonic weapon, and on the Cubans. Yet the diagnosis of mild brain injury, considered unlikely to result from sound, has confounded the FBI, the state department and US intelligence agencies involved in the investigation.\n\nSome victims now have problems concentrating or recalling specific words, several officials said, the latest signs of more serious damage than the US government initially realized. The United States first acknowledged the attacks in August – nine months after symptoms were first reported.\n\nThe Trump administration still hasn’t identified a culprit or a device to explain the attacks, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former US officials, Cuban officials and others briefed on the investigation. Most weren’t authorized to discuss the probe and demanded anonymity.\n\nIn fact, almost nothing about what went down in Havana is clear. Investigators have tested several theories about an intentional attack: by Cuba’s government, a rogue faction of its security forces, a third country like Russia or some combination thereof. Yet they’ve left open the possibility an advanced espionage operation went horribly awry, or that some other, less nefarious explanation is to blame.\n\nAside from their homes, officials said Americans were attacked in at least one hotel, a fact not previously disclosed. An incident occurred on an upper floor of the recently renovated Hotel Capri, a 60-year-old concrete tower steps from the Malecon, Havana’s iconic, waterside promenade.\n\nThe cases vary deeply: different symptoms, different recollections of what happened.\n\nIn several episodes recounted by US officials, victims knew it was happening in real time, and there were strong indications of a sonic attack.\n\nSome felt vibrations, and heard sounds – loud ringing or a high-pitch chirping similar to crickets or cicadas. Others heard the grinding noise. Some victims awoke with ringing in their ears and fumbled for their alarm clocks, only to discover the ringing stopped when they moved away from their beds.\n\nThe attacks seemed to come at night. Several victims reported they came in minute-long bursts.\n\nYet others heard nothing, felt nothing. Later, their symptoms came.\n\nThe scope keeps widening. On Tuesday, the state department disclosed that doctors had confirmed another two cases, bringing the total American victims to 21. Some have mild traumatic brain injury, known as a concussion, and others permanent hearing loss.\n\nEven the potential motive is unclear. Investigators are at a loss to explain why Canadians were harmed, too, including some who reported nosebleeds. Fewer than 10 Canadian diplomatic households in Cuba were affected, a Canadian official said.\n\n\n\nUnlike the US, Canada has maintained warm ties to Cuba for decades.\n\n\n\nSound and health experts are equally baffled. Targeted, localized beams of sound are possible, but the laws of acoustics suggest such a device would probably be large and not easily concealed. Officials said it’s unclear whether the device’s effects were localized by design or due to some other technical factor.\n\n\n\nAnd no single, sonic gadget seems to explain such an odd, inconsistent array of physical responses.\n\n\n\n“Brain damage and concussions, it’s not possible,” said Joseph Pompei, a former MIT researcher and psychoacoustics expert. “Somebody would have to submerge their head into a pool lined with very powerful ultrasound transducers.”\n\n\n\nOther symptoms have included brain swelling, dizziness, nausea, severe headaches, balance problems and tinnitus, or prolonged ringing in the ears. Many victims have shown improvement since leaving Cuba and some suffered only minor or temporary symptoms.\n\n\n\nAfter the US complained to Cuba’s government earlier this year and Canada detected its own cases, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police traveled to Havana to investigate.\n\n\n\nFBI investigators swept the rooms, looking for devices. They found nothing, several officials briefed on the investigation said.\n\n\n\nIn May, Washington expelled two Cuban diplomats to protest the communist government’s failure to protect Americans serving there. But the US has taken pains not to accuse Havana of perpetrating the attacks. It’s a sign investigators believe that even if elements of Cuba’s security forces were involved, it wasn’t necessarily directed from the top.\n\n\n\nCuba’s government declined to answer specific questions about the incidents, pointing to a previous foreign affairs ministry statement denying any involvement, vowing full cooperation and saying it was treating the situation “with utmost importance”.\n\n\n\n“Cuba has never, nor would it ever, allow that the Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic agents or their families, without exception,” the Cuban statement said.\n\n\n\nAfter half a century of estrangement, the US and Cuba in 2015 restored diplomatic ties between countries separated by a mere 90 miles of water. Embassies were re-opened and restrictions on travel and commerce eased. Donald Trump has reversed some of those changes, but left others in place.\n\n\n\nHow could the 'sonic attack' on US diplomats in Cuba have been carried out? Read more\n\nMark Feierstein, who oversaw the Cuba detente on Barack Obama’s national security council, noted that Cuban authorities have been uncharacteristically cooperative with the investigation.\n\n\n\nIf the Trump administration felt confident Raul Castro’s government was to blame, it’s likely the US would have already taken major punitive steps, like shuttering the newly re-established American embassy. And the US hasn’t stopped sending new diplomats to Cuba even as the victim list grows.\n\n\n\n“Had they thought the Cuban government was deliberately attacking American diplomats, that would have had a much more negative effect,” Feierstein said. “We haven’t seen that yet.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/14/mystery-of-sonic-weapon-attacks-at-us-embassy-in-cuba-deepens","1505361600.0"

It's constantly forcing you to evolve and improve in all areas.'\n\nLee has become one of the most popular MMA fighters in Asia.\n\nMaking a man's world her own\n\nToday Lee divides her time between Hawaii, where the family moved when she was young, and Singapore, where she's a member of the Evolve fight team and competes with the ONE Championship organization -- considered by many to be the Asian equivalent of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), an American organization and the largest MMA promoter in the world.\n\nWhen Lee emerged victorious from her championship fight last May, her new contract with ONE reportedly made her one of the highest paid females in the history of any MMA organization in the world\n\nThough specific details about her contract haven't been released, ONE founder Chatri Sityodtong has publicly said that Lee is now one of the top five best-paid fighters in his organization.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Facebook page: 'I believe in meritocracy and that is how all of my companies are run. Everyone should be afforded the equal opportunity to be the master of his/her own destiny through his/her thoughts, words, and actions.\n\n'At my companies, we don't care about paper qualifications, CVs, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, social status, nationality, color.'\n\nIndeed, the fact that Lee's upcoming battle against Taiwanese MMA fighter Jenny Huang, on March 11 in Bangkok, is currently the next major event on ONE's calendar highlights a global shift in the level of respect afforded to women in MMA.\n\nLee recognizes the rare position she's in.\n\n'I think that it's really important because I'm competing in Southeast Asia and in these countries I understand that a lot of women don't have the same opportunities the men do,' she says.\n\nCareer defining moment\n\nWhen asked to pick the one fight that has meant the most to her in her short career, Lee points to her first professional fight with promoter ONE Championship -- a moment that still gives her chills.\n\nLee overtook her opponent Aya Saber in the first round, in just one minute and 43 seconds via arm bar, a submission move that involves hyper-extending an opponent's elbow joint so that they're forced to tap out.\n\nI was walking out to the cage ... and all these thoughts were coming in my head, all these doubts, and I just couldn't shake it off.

Some sports media dubbed it ONE's top fight of 2016\n\n'I owe (the win) to my preparation and my training for the fight but also I was very happy that I was able to overcome all those doubts and insecurities that I had and come out victorious.

I'm just a kid, practically. A 20-year-old girl. I'm a professional MMA fighter and a world champion. I'm pretty much a living testimony to breaking these stereotypes that fighters are supposed to look a certain way, act a certain way.'\n\nBut regardless whether a woman wants to step into a cage and fight, Lee says it's important for females to know how to defend themselves.\n\n'Martial arts is so much more than (fighting),' she says. 'It really gives you self-confidence, it promotes a healthier lifestyle and definitely there's the self-defense aspect.

"FULL TRANSCRIPT: President Donald Trump's interview with 'Face the Nation'\nOn his 100th day in office Saturday, President Trump spoke to CBS News' chief Washington correspondent and host of 'Face the Nation,' John Dickerson, about his accomplishments at the traditional milestone and beyond, before flying to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to give a speech at a rally.\n\nWhat follows is a full transcript of the interview, which aired on CBS earlier Sunday. Additional coverage of the interview will air Monday on 'CBS This Morning,' broadcasting live from the White House.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Mr. President, you and the administration said to North Korea, 'Don't test a missile.' They have tested a missile. Is the pressure not working?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I didn't say, 'Don't test a missile.' He's going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we're not going to be very happy. And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also. But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We'll see what happens.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You say, 'Not happy.' What does that mean?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would not be happy. If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Not happy mean military action?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't know. I mean, we'll see.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: The Chinese, our allies, have been allies with North Korea. How are you sure that they're not using this as a way to test you?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You can never be sure of anything, can you? But I developed a very good relationship. I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea. I don't think they want to see it. They certainly don't want to see nuclear on -- from their neighbor. They haven't liked it for a long time. But we'll have to see what happens.\n\nThe relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had. But again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to affect change.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Why do--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I hope he is.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Why do these missiles keep blowing up?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I'd rather not discuss it. But perhaps they're just not very good missiles. But eventually, he'll have good missiles.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You don't want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I just don't want to discuss it. And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military. I said, 'We shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul.' I said, 'We shouldn't be announcing all our moves.' It is a chess game. I just don't want people to know what my thinking is. So eventually, he will have a better delivery system. And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What do you make of the North Korean leader?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have -- I really, you know, have no comment on him. People are saying, 'Is he sane?' I have no idea. I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.\n\nAnd at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie. But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue. And frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration. Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration. Should've been taken care of by Clinton.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question about the presidency. George W. Bush said this about being president. He said, 'You think one thing going in, and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought.' Do you agree?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I can agree with that. I love doing it. I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it. It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge. But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You said in an interview with Reuters that you thought it would be easier. Why?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, it's a tough job. But I've had a lot of tough jobs. I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years. Perhaps eight years. Hopefully, eight years. But I'll let you know later on. I think we've done very well with foreign policy. I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders.\n\nI think we're doing great on trade deals. It's set. And I think we're doing well. I mean, our country is being out-traded at every single point. We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade. And I think actually, I've been very consistent. You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media which sometimes, I must say, is you.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You mean me personally or?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, your show. I love your show. I call it Deface the Nation. But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct. But when they talk about currency manipulation, and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator, early in my tenure. And then I get there. Number one, they -- as soon as I got elected, they stopped. They're not -- it's not going down anymore, their currency.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But that had been true before. That had been true--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --during the campaign, sir.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, not true to the extent that we're talking about. Much more important than that, as to when, but, you know, it did stop. And I was talking about it all during the campaign. And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop. But forget that.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You were the one who got China--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He is working with us--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --to stop manipulating their currency?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think so, during the campaign I talked about.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Even if they were doing it before?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, they were doing it before. I mean, there was no question. I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before. But somebody said, 'Oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator.' Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working -- I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem, for China also.\n\nAnd that's North Korea. Can you imagine if I say, 'Hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea? Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow.' So the mainstream media never talks about that. They never say that. And that's, you know, unfortunate. It's just--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it's just one of many things, John.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You're a negotiator. If you need something from somebody, you need China to help you with North Korea, doesn't that send a message to China, 'We're not going to bug you about human rights, about intellectual property. In the South China Sea we're not going to put too much heat on you'? Aren't you breaking one of your own negotiating rules?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay? You understand what I'm saying. And if I can use trade as a method to get China, because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea. Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers. Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What do you know now on day 100 that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really. I've done things that are I think very good. I've set great foundations with foreign leaders. We have you know -- NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.\n\nI got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. And they said please would you rather than terminating NAFTA -- I was all set to do it. In fact, I was going to do it today. I was going to do as we're sitting here. I would've had to delay you. I was going to do it today. I was going to terminate NAFTA. But they called up and they said, 'Would you negotiate?' And I said, 'Yes, I will negotiate.'\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: That's all you've learned, about the media? You knew from the campaign about the media. You said it all the time --\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no, but the media didn't cover it that way. The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: First of all, if you look at my statements, I said--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: No, no, I meant--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 'If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA.' Well, I'll make that statement right now.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Here's a question.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let's step back a minute.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Presidents have to learn how to adapt. Every president comes into the job, it's different than they expect, they must adapt. Surely, you've learned something else other than that the media is dishonest.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no, I'm just saying--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: And how do you adapt?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it was one of my disappointments.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Give me another thing you learned that you're going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stage.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Why?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Just a system. It's just a very, very bureaucratic system. I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving. And in many cases, unfair. In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make. You'd make a much different kind of a deal.\n\nYou're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into. I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of. The Democrats have been totally obstructionist. Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader. He's a bad leader for the country. And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.\n\nAll they do is obstruct. All they do is delay. Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch. I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that. But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved. Our chief trade negotiator. We can't get these people through.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They are obstructionists. And you know what that's hurting? It's hurting the country.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about health care -- Tucker Carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations. And you agreed with him that the health care bill wasn't going to help your supporters. That those who lived in rural areas, the older, were going to get hurt by that bill. And you told him--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me, the health care bill is going to help my supporters.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Well, hold on. Let me just finish the question, if I may, sir--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Otherwise, I'm not going to sign it. I'm not going to do it.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Well, this is why I wanted to ask you. You said to Tucker, 'We will take care of our people, or I am not signing it.' You said you were going to negotiate.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's what I just said.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So tell me what in the bill you've been negotiating to get--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But let me--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --in that helps your supporters. I'm just trying to get the details of how your people--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just tell you.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --will be helped.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, 'Pre-existing is not covered.' Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, 'Has to be.'\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have, we're going to have lower premiums. And before you start there, let me just tell you something. Obamacare is dead. Obamacare right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing. Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies. They're all going. Obamacare, John, is dead. Okay, because we're being -- we're being compared to Obamacare. Just, so. Obamacare doesn't work--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: I just want to compare you to your own.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: One thing. No, no, it's important. I've got to compare it.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: No, no, but I want--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But you were saying about Obamacare.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: No, but I'm not. I'm asking what--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: With Obamacare--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --you're going to do.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it. But more importantly, it's dead.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So but in the bill, as it was analyzed, there were two problems. One, and you talked about this with Congressman Robert Aderholt, who brought you the example of the 64-year-old who under Obamacare the premiums--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But that was a long time ago, John.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But has that been fixed?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Totally fixed.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: How?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How? We've made many changes to the bill. You know, this bill is--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What kind though?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --very much different than it was three weeks ago.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Help us explain because there are people--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The bill--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --out there wondering what kind of changes.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me explain. Let me explain it to you.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved. And we didn't have a failure on the bill. You know, it was reported like a failure. Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline. That's why on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.\n\nBut we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We have -- we've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall. We're taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But that's not in--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --nationwide.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --this bill. The borders are not in--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course, it's in.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --this bill. It's in that third bill, right, because--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's in the second phase.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's called phase one, phase two. And that's, in effect, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But let me just explain something. There will be such competition. Right now, there's no competition. There will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The other thing we're going to have is groups. Groups of people can negotiate. What's going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums. In my opinion, much, much more than people understand.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So what you've just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldn't help your people. And here's why I ask. You said, 'Pre-existing conditions.'\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Although--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll tell you who doesn't cover pre-existing conditions. Obamacare. You know why? It's dead.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: In one of the fixes that was--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not going to be here.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: In one of the fixes it was discussed pre-existing was optional for the states--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure, in one of the fixes. And they're changing it--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --oh, okay. So it'll--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --and changing.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --be permanent?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Well, that's a development, sir. So you're saying it's going to be pre-existing to everybody?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: John, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks. Now, we really have a good bill. I think they could have voted on Friday. I said, 'Just relax. Don't worry about this phony 100 day thing. Just relax. Take it easy. Take your time. Get the good vote and make it perfect.'\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Just to--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Most importantly, we're going to drive down premiums. We're going to drive down deductibles because right now, deductibles are so high, you never -- unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you something--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because the deductibles are so high.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay. So what I hear you saying is pre-existing is going to be in there for everybody, it's not going to be up to the states?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Pre-existing is going to be in there and we're also--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: And it's not up to the states?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --going to create pools.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And pools are going to take care of the pre-existing.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But on that crucial question, it's not going to be left up to the states? Everybody gets pre-existing, no matter where they live?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, but the states--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Guaranteed?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Is it a guarantee?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, because if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things, than your knee, okay? Or than your back, as important as your back is. I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --bigger things. Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care, because it's smaller.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: People out there with pre-existing conditions, they are worried. Are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a pre-existing condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides that's not a part of the health care, or that the prices are going to go up? That's the worry. The American Medical Association says--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We actually--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we actually have, well, forget about unaffordable. What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So I'm not hearing you, Mr. President, say there's a guarantee of pre-existing conditions.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We actually have -- we actually have a clause that guarantees.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay, excellent. We got there.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a specific clause--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that guarantees.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --about your tax plan.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Tax plan came out this week. It's got some big deficit numbers. You've said that's going to be made up by growth. Congressional--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, not only growth. It's going to be made up by better trade deals. It's going to be made up--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --by many different, reciprocal tax. As an example, we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100% tax. If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing. You think that's smart? It's not.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Look--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries. But I view that more in trade. We're also going to fix all of our trade deals. We're going to have a very wealthy country again.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, Mr. President. Congress may not go along with--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Always.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --so they're going to try and find some spending. Let me ask you about the question of Medicare. They're going to want, in Congress, to make up on the spending side, to change Medicare. Will you allow that?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're not going to have to do it.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But, sir, will you allow it?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You're not going to have to do it. I'm just telling you we are--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Does President Donald Trump want them not to do that?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would much prefer them not to do that, that's right.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: It sounds as if, having covered you in the campaign, it sounds like you're leaving the door open. On the campaign, you were quite clear. You said, 'I'm the guy who's not going to touch Medicare.'\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, then let me more clear. I'm not going to touch it, because I said it. Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch. If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that. There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused. There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive and there's been terrible things happening. So that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So if I--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: For me, if I have it now, or if I'm going to have it in the future, it's not getting cut?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: And that's it?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Other than that, it's tightened up?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right. That's what it is. But here's what we do. We're going to grow. The numbers just came out for Obama's last year. 1.6 GDP. That means nothing. That's, like, 1% GDP. So I have gotten to know as you know, I really get along with a lot of other countries. So I talk to the heads of countries. 'How are you doing?' 'Not well, not well.' 'Why?' 'GDP is 8%. GDP is 9%. We are doing poorly.' GDP -- Our GDP is, like, 1%.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about your tax returns, sir. When your Treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them, Secretary Mnuchin said, 'The president has no intention.' Is that right?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I never spoke to him about it. Honestly, he's never asked me about it. I said, number one, I'm under audit. Right now, I'm under audit. After the audit is complete. It's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return. You've seen the pictures. My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor. When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big. My tax return is this high.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: I just wanted to make sure--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm under routine--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --you weren't changing.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --audit. And I think it's a very unfair thing because I have been under audit almost, like, since I became famous, okay?\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Have you--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Not just political. I mean, I have been under audit, I'll bet you 12 or 13 or 14 years in a row. Now, I have friends that are wealthy people.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They've never been audited.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think it's very unfair.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You first said that you were under audit, were going to wait till that was done, about 14 months ago. That seems like a long time. When do you think this might happen? Are you asking them?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It could happen soon. I don't know. I mean, I think--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: When? Give me a sense of--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it's pretty routine, to be honest with you. But then I'll make a decision.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: A member of Congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns. What do you think about that?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I don't know who did that. I mean, I don't care who did that. These are the people, you know, the great obstructionists.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So you're not buying that deal.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look where they are. Look where the Democrats have ended up. Hey, John, they had everything going. Now they don't have the presidency, they don't have the House, they don't have the Senate, and Schumer's going around making a fool out of himself.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You said yesterday on FOX that Russia is a phony story. Which part of it is phony?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Meaning the Trump campaign?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course, it's a total phony story. In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But you don't mean--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015 and he was on the Obama clearance. When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have. I think the same clearance as the president of the United States would have. He had this really high clearance. And, by the way, they're so devastated because this only came up two days ago.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, sir.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why wasn't this reported months ago?\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: I--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I watched one of your other competitors, and they were devastated--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Look--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --by this news, because you know what? That kills them. That's the end of that subject.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You don't think it's phony that they, the Russians, tried to meddle in the election? You believe that?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That, I don't know. I don't know.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: That you don't know or you do know?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I have a problem. You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia. Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia. Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia. Nobody ever talks about that. But I don't know--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You don't--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because the F.B.I. was not allowed by Podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check. That's number one.\n\nNumber two, knowing something about hacking, if you don't catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I'll go along with Russia. Could've been China, could've been a lot of different groups.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So President Donald Trump is ambivalent--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But it could've--\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --about or not ambivalent, you're not just not sure?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. We have to find out what happened. I'd love to find out what happened.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But you don't think it's the Russians--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can tell you one thing. Had nothing to do with us. Had nothing to do with this, and everyone knows it. And by the way, even my enemies on your show said, 'We haven't found anything that the Trump campaign did wrong.'\n\nJOHN DICKERON: But--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you agree with that?\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: But there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on the Hill that Russia was--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm okay with it.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: --involved in the election.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Honestly, John, I'm okay. But why didn't Podesta and the Democrats, why didn't they allow the F.B.I. to eject the server? They hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about, to go and check their server and give the information. So they were hacked. Why didn't they -- the Democrats allow the F.B.I.? They told the F.B.I., 'We are not going to allow you to do it.' Why did they do that? Why did they do that, John? Why wouldn't they let the F.B.I. go in and check? And by the way, why didn't the F.B.I. complain about it?\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Mr. President, I think we're going to have to end it there.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-interview-full-transcript-face-the-nation/","None"
"Bomb Attack in Mogadishu Kills 276, Somali Minister Says\nBreaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nMOGADISHU, Somalia — A huge truck bomb blast in Somalia's capital has killed 276 people and wounded roughly 300 more, the country's information minister said Sunday.\n\nIt is believed to be the single deadliest attack ever in the Horn of Africa nation.\n\nDoctors struggled to assist horrifically wounded victims, many burned beyond recognition. Officials feared that the toll would continue to climb from Saturday's truck bomb, which targeted a busy street near key ministries.\n\nA man runs from a massive explosion Sunday in front of the Safari Hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia. SAID YUSUF WARSAME / EPA\n\nAmbulance sirens still echoed across the city as bewildered families wandered in the rubble of buildings, looking for missing relatives. 'In our 10 year experience as the first responder in #Mogadishu, we haven't seen anything like this,' the Aamin Ambulance service tweeted.\n\nGrief overwhelmed many. 'There's nothing I can say. We have lost everything,' said Zainab Sharif, the mother of four children, who lost her husband. She sat outside a hospital where he was pronounced dead after hours of efforts by doctors to save him from an arterial injury.\n\nRelated: America's Military Role in Africa Is Growing\n\nPresident Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed declared three days of mourning and joined thousands of people who responded to a desperate plea by hospitals to donate blood.\n\nDr. Mohamed Yusuf, director of Medina hospital, said: 'The hospital is overwhelmed by both dead and wounded. We also received people whose limbs were cut away by the bomb. This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past.'\n\nOvernight, rescue workers with flashlights searched for survivors trapped under the rubble of the largely destroyed Safari Hotel, which is close to the Foreign Ministry. The explosion blew off metal gates and blast walls erected outside the hotel.\n\nThe government has blamed the al-Qaida-linked extremist group al-Shabab for the attack, which it called a 'national disaster.' However, al-Shabab, which often targets high-profile areas of the capital with bombings, had yet to comment.\n\nPhotos: Somalis Search for Survivors After Mogadishu Truck Bomb Blast\n\n'They don't care about the lives of Somali people, mothers, fathers and children,' Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire said. 'They have targeted the most populated area in Mogadishu, killing only civilians.'\n\nSomali soldiers helps a wounded civilian from a truck blast Saturday in Mogadishu, Somalia. Farah Abdi Warsameh / AP\n\nInformation Minister Abdirahman Omar said the blast was the largest the city had ever seen. 'It's a sad day. This is how merciless and brutal they are, and we have to unite against them,' he said on state-run radio.\n\nThe United States joined the condemnation, saying: 'Such cowardly attacks reinvigorate the commitment of the United States to assist our Somali and African Union partners to combat the scourge of terrorism.'\n\nThe U.S. military has stepped up drone strikes and other efforts this year against al-Shabab, which is also fighting the Somali military and more than 20,000 African Union forces in the country.\n\nSaturday's blast occurred two days after the head of U.S. Africa Command was in Mogadishu to meet with Somalia's president and two days after the country's defense minister and army chief resigned for undisclosed reasons.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/truck-bomb-rocks-mogadishu-hotel-killing-85-police-n810781","None"
"U.S. police chiefs blast Trump for endorsing ‘police brutality’\nDuring a speech to law enforcement on July 28, President Trump said 'please don't be too nice' to suspects who are arrested. (The Washington Post)\n\nPolice leaders across the country moved quickly to distance themselves from — or to outright condemn — President Trump’s statements about “roughing up” people who’ve been arrested.\n\nThe swift public denunciations came as departments are under intense pressure to stamp out brutality and excessive force that can erode the relationship between officers and the people they police — and cost police chiefs their jobs.\n\nSome police leaders worried that three sentences uttered by the president during a Long Island, N.Y., speech could upend nearly three decades of fence-mending since the 1991 Los Angeles Police Department beating of Rodney King ushered in an era of distrust of police.\n\n“It’s the wrong message,” Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, told Washington radio station WTOP while speaking of the trust-building work that departments have undertaken since King’s beating. “The last thing we need is a green light from the president of the United States for officers to use unnecessary force.”\n\nTrump made the comments at a gathering of law enforcement officers at Suffolk County Community College in New York.\n\n“When you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over?” Trump said, miming the physical motion of an officer shielding a suspect’s head to keep it from bumping against the squad car.\n\n“Like, don’t hit their head, and they just killed somebody — don’t hit their head,” Trump continued. “I said, you can take the hand away, okay?”\n\nTrump’s remarks came after he spoke about local towns ravaged by gang violence.\n\n\n\nPolice officers react as President Trump speaks at Suffolk County Community College on Long Island on Friday. (Jonathan Ernst/ Reuters)\n\nAcross the country, police department leaders said the president’s words didn’t reflect their views.\n\nIt is our sworn duty to protect people from unjustified violence and harm, no matter who disagrees.https://t.co/ouDLXH6JfY — Burlington Police (@OneNorthAvenue) July 29, 2017\n\nThe @POTUS made remarks today that endorsed and condoned police brutality. GPD rejects these remarks and continues to serve with respect. — Gainesville Police (@GainesvillePD) July 29, 2017\n\n“The Suffolk County Police Department has strict rules and procedures relating to the handling of prisoners, and violations of those rules and procedures are treated extremely seriously,” the department said in an emailed statement. “As a department, we do not and will not tolerate ‘rough[ing]’ up prisoners.”\n\nTrump’s comments also drew a rebuke from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In a statement Friday, the group did not specifically mention Trump by name but appeared to respond to his speech by stressing the importance of treating all people, including suspects, with respect.\n\nMike Lopez, a Los Angeles police spokesman, told CNN that the department will “treat everyone with integrity and respect.”\n\n“We work with partnerships in our community and continue to do that to keep our communities safe and secure from crime,” he told the news network. “With the help of our community we will continue to do this.”\n\nDarrel Stephens, a former police chief who is now the Executive Director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, told The Washington Post that the president’s words were a step back for police departments.\n\n“Over the past two or three years, police departments have worked very, very hard to restore the loss of confidence and trust that people, particularly in the African-American community, have in the police, based on what happened in Ferguson and the other high profile shootings,” Stephens said. “Maybe not just what the president said, but the reaction of the police officers standing behind him, I think that complicates that.\n\n“It sort of reinforces that there’s sort of a wink and a nod about these things, when that’s simply not the case.”\n\nStatements from other police leaders followed:\n\nPortland Police Bureau officers are expected to treat everyone with dignity & respect, even when they are a suspect. https://t.co/f2bdGCIbcr — Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) July 29, 2017\n\nTo be clear, inappropriate attempt at gallows humor does not reflect values of respect & commitment to constitutional policing of profession https://t.co/lGJeLa6nm1 — Chief Art Acevedo (@ArtAcevedo) July 28, 2017\n\nWell said, Chief.

We do not intend to go backwards. It is truly unfortunate that in today’s toxic environment, politicians at both ends of the spectrum have sought to inflame passions by politicizing what we do. We remain committed to our principles and reject irresponsible statements that threaten to undermine our relationship with the community.\n\nA Boston Police Department statement obtained by CNN said the department’s “priority has been and continues to be building relationships and trust with the community we serve. As a police department we are committed to helping people, not harming them.”\n\nIn New York, Police Commissioner James O’Neill told the network that to “suggest that police officers apply any standard in the use of force other than what is reasonable and necessary is irresponsible, unprofessional and sends the wrong message to law enforcement as well as the public.”\n\nBut the group Blue Lives Matter insisted that the president’s remarks were a joke:\n\nTrump didn't tell police to go out & brutalize people as the media would have you believe. It was a joke. https://t.co/yBq6PGY0pa — Blue Lives Matter (@bluelivesmtr) July 28, 2017\n\nJim Bueermann, who heads the nonprofit Police Foundation told CNN that the organization welcomes Trump’s support for law enforcement but “we cannot support any commentary — in sincerity or jest — that undermines the trust that our communities place in us to protect and serve.”\n\nPolice departments are under increased scrutiny for violent, often fatal interactions with suspects. So far this year, 574 people have been shot and killed by police, according to The Washington Post’s Fatal Force database. Last year, police shot and killed 963 people.\n\nThis year’s killings included the Minneapolis Police shooting of Justine Damond, an Australian woman who called 911 to report a possible rape in the alley near her home and ended up shot dead by the responding officers.\n\nThe department’s missteps — neither officer had activated his body camera, so there’s no video evidence of the fatal encounter — resulted in international criticism and the ouster of Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau.\n\nShe was the fourth chief in recent years to lose her job after a controversial fatal shooting.\n\nRead more:\n\nA body cam captured a cop’s violent encounter with a teen — but a new law keeps the video secret\n\n‘I was just reading a book’: Canadian cops called on black man reading C.S.

But they didn’t know France!”\n\nPlay Video 3:08 Who is the new French president, Emmanuel Macron? – video\n\nDespite the wide margin of the final result, Le Pen’s score nonetheless marked a historic high for the French far right. Even after a lacklustre campaign that ended with a calamitous performance in the final TV debate, she was projected to have taken almost 11m votes, double that of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, when he reached the presidential run-off in 2002. The anti-immigration, anti-EU Front National’s supporters asserted that the party had a central place as an opposition force in France.\n\nTurnout was the lowest in more than 40 years. Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen, with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers.\n\nMacron, who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago, is France’s youngest president. Next Sunday, he will take over a country under a state of emergency, still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment. France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war.\n\n\n\nFrançois Bayrou, an ex-minister and Macron’s centrist ally, said: “He is the youngest head of state on the planet [which] sends an incredible message of hope. Macron is giving hope to people who had no hope. Hope that maybe we can do something, go beyond the [left-right] divide that no longer makes sense.”\n\nLe Pen swiftly conceded defeat. She said she had won a “historic and massive” score that made her leader of “the biggest opposition force” in France and vowed to radically overhaul her Front National party. Her promise to “transform” the far-right movement left open the possibility that the party could be expanded and renamed in an attempt to boost its electoral chances. It was a major step in the political normalisation of her movement.\n\nThe outgoing Socialist president, François Hollande, who was once Macron’s mentor and had appointed him economy minister, said: “His large victory confirms that a very great majority of our citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union and show France is open to the world.”\n\nOn Monday Hollande embraced his successor as the two men attended a ceremony at Paris’s Arc de Triomphe to commemorate victory over the Nazis in the second world war. Hollande walked beside Macron to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the monument, where they laid a wreath.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Macron and Hollande attend a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Monday. Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/Reuters\n\nMacron’s victory came not only because voters supported his policy platform for free market, pro-business reform, and his promises to energise the EU, coupled with a leftwing approach to social issues. Some of his voters came from other parties across the political spectrum and turned out not in complete support of his programme but to stop the Front National.\n\nIn a political landscape with a strong hard left and far right, Macron faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! (On the Move!) in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises.\n\nAfter the Brexit vote and the election of Trump as US president, the race for the Élysée was the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo, ejecting the mainstream parties that have dominated French politics for 50 years and leaving the political novice Macron to do battle with the far right.\n\nHis victory comes after a bitter campaign with Le Pen in which she accused him of being part of an elite that did not understand ordinary people and he said Le Pen represented the “party of hatred” that wanted a “civil war” in France. The runoff pitted France’s most Europhile candidate against its most Europhobe.\n\n\n\nIn Brussels and Berlin, there was relief that Le Pen’s anti-EU, anti-globalisation programme was defeated.\n\nA spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said it was a “victory for a strong and united Europe” while the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said French voters had chosen a “European future”.\n\nThe office of the British prime minister, Theresa May, said she “warmly congratulates” Macron on his victory and “we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities”.\n\nTrump, who will meet Macron on 25 May at the Nato summit in Brussels, tweeted: “Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next president of France. I look very much forward to working with him!” Earlier in the campaign, he had declared Le Pen the strongest candidate.\n\nIn a congratulatory statement, the Kremlin, which was widely seen as backing Le Pen, urged Macron to overcome mutual distrust and join forces to ensure international stability and security.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters of Macron celebrating in Paris on Sunday night. Photograph: Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters\n\nHours before the end of campaigning on Friday night, Macron’s campaign was hacked, which Paris prosecutors are investigating. Hundreds of thousands of emails and documents were dumped online and spread by WikiLeaks in what his campaign called an attempt at “democratic destabilisation”.\n\n\n\nMacron, a former investment banker and senior civil servant who grew up in a bourgeois family in Amiens, served as deputy chief of staff to Hollande but was not part of the Socialist party.\n\nWhat is in Macron's in-tray as president? France’s youngest president takes over a country exhausted by years of unemployment and facing a constant terrorist threat. So what will his first moves be? First, Macron, who comes from no established political party, needs to appoint a prime minister and a cabinet, and win a parliamentary majority in next month’s election. Next, he will need to swiftly fulfil some of his manifesto promises: including streamlining France’s strict labour laws in favour of businesses, overhauling the ethics rules for politicians, and strengthening ties with Germany's Angela Merkel and the rest of the EU.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Hollande appointed him economy minister but he left government in 2016, complaining that pro-business reforms were not going far enough. A year ago he formed En Marche!, promising to shake up France’s “vacuous” and discredited political class.\n\n\n\nMacron campaigned on pledges to ease labour laws, improve education in deprived areas and extend protections for self-employed people.\n\n\n\nThe election race was full of extraordinary twists and turns. Hollande became the first president since the war to decide not to run again for office after slumping to record unpopularity with a satisfaction rating of 4%.\n\nHis troubled five-year term left France still struggling with a sluggish economy and a mood of disillusionment with the political class. The country is more divided than ever before. More than 230 people have been killed in terrorist attacks in little more than two years, the political class is questioning Islam’s place in French society and more than three million people are unemployed.\n\n\n\nThe rightwing candidate, François Fillon, once seen as favourite, was badly damaged by a judicial investigation into a string of corruption allegations, including that he paid his wife and children generous salaries from public funds for fake parliamentary assistant jobs.\n\nThe Guardian view on the French election: Good luck, Mr Macron. You will need it | Editorial Read more\n\nThe ruling Socialist party, under its candidate Benoît Hamon, saw its score plunge to 6%, while the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon finished fourth.\n\nThe final round marks a redrawing of the political landscape, away from the old left-right divide towards a contest between a liberal, pro-globalisation stance and “close the borders” nationalism. Le Pen has styled the election as being between her party’s “patriots” and the “globalists” whom she says Macron represents.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidency-marine-le-pen","1494129600.0"
"Video footage shows Minn. traffic stop that ended with Philando Castile’s death\nThe officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop last year fired within seconds of learning that Castile was armed, according to a video recording released publicly on June 20. (Editor's note: This video contains graphic content.) (YouTube/Ramsey County)\n\nThe Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop last year fired a volley of bullets within seconds of learning the driver was armed, according to a video recording released publicly Tuesday.\n\nWhen the traffic stop began, the two men interacted calmly. Officer Jeronimo Yanez, a police officer in the Twin Cities suburbs, greeted Castile and examined his insurance card.\n\n“Sir, I have to tell you that I do have a firearm on me,” Castile said 30 seconds after they began speaking.\n\n“Okay,” Yanez interrupted, his voice remaining steady as he shifted his right hand onto the holster of his gun.\n\nYanez told Castile not to reach for the gun or pull it out. Castile said he was not, which was echoed by Diamond Reynolds, his girlfriend, sitting in the Oldsmobile’s passenger seat.\n\n“I’m not pulling it out,” Castile responded. Yanez again yelled: “Don’t pull it out!” He then unholstered his gun and pushed it into the car.\n\n“Don’t pull it out!” Yanez yelled. “I’m not!” Castile said as Yanez, seven seconds after being informed of the gun, began firing into the car.\n\n[Minn. officer acquitted in shooting of Philando Castile during traffic stop, dismissed from police force]\n\nThe moments after quickly made their way around the world, as Reynolds began streaming live on Facebook, pleading with Castile to “stay with me” while blood soaked into his T-shirt. Castile died not long after. Spurred by Reynolds’s video, that fatal shooting in July 2016 became part of the country’s roiling debate about how police officers use deadly force.\n\nThe Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop was acquitted on all charges by a jury on June 16, nearly a year after his death. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nA jury acquitted Yanez of manslaughter last week, a decision that set off protests in the St. Paul area. The same day, St. Anthony officials said Yanez would not be returning to their police department. Yanez also was acquitted on two felony charges of endangering Reynolds — who was sitting in the passenger seat — and her 4-year-old daughter, who was sitting behind her in a car seat.\n\nCastile was among 963 people fatally shot by police officers last year, according to a Washington Post database tracking such shootings. While Reynolds’s footage pushed the encounter into the headlines, making it one of the most widely known police shootings in recent years, it was not the only recording captured that night.\n\nA police dashboard camera was also filming, and that recording was played during Yanez’s trial but was not publicly released until Tuesday afternoon. Details from the recording were revealed in court documents and during the trial, but they were not publicly visible in the same way as Reynolds’s viral Facebook footage. The dash-cam video does not clearly show Castile’s movements inside the car.\n\n“Based upon the release of the dashcam video today, it is clear that Officer Jeronimo Yanez was not in control, was nervous and acted in a reckless, willful and wanton fashion,” Larry R. Rogers Jr., an attorney for Reynolds, said in a statement Tuesday. “We are exploring our next steps in light of the compelling evidence of Officer Yanez’s wrongdoing that led to this tragedy.”\n\n[After an acquittal, activists look for signs of hope]\n\nYanez told investigators he feared for his life, and he said the same thing during his testimony earlier this month. According to the officer, he thought Castile was grabbing a gun, which Reynolds had disputed.\n\n“I know he had an object and it was dark,” Yanez told investigators, according to the criminal complaint filed by prosecutors last year. “And he was pulling it out with his right hand. And as he was pulling it out I, a million things started going through my head. And I thought I was gonna die.”\n\nThe police car dash-cam video was part of evidence released Tuesday afternoon by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. The collection included documents and other recordings that were part of the state’s investigation into the shooting. The documents and recordings were being made “available to the public, as they were presented in court, but without the context that we were able to provide at trial,” according to a spokesman for Ramsey County Attorney John J. Choi, who prosecuted the case.\n\nAn attorney representing Yanez did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\n[Thousands dead, few prosecuted: Officers are rarely charged]\n\nExperts caution that video footage of police shootings can remain incomplete and, even if capturing an entire incident, might not definitively answer what an officer saw at that moment.\n\n“The officer’s judged by what he or she reasonably sees or perceives,” said David J. MacMain, a former Pennsylvania state trooper and attorney who represents law enforcement officers in civil cases.\n\nMacMain also said that when videos are released publicly, the encounters are dissected in a different way than officers perceive them while they unfold.\n\n“We all get to look at it 20 times over and replay and zoom in and zoom out,” MacMain said. “Officers have to make split-second decisions, and we all get to critique it over the next four, five, six, seven months.”\n\nRecordings are inevitably incomplete, said David A. Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert in police uses of force.\n\n“Video doesn’t always capture the whole sequence of events,” Harris said. “This case was an example of that. We have a situation in which the Facebook Live stream only begins after the shooting itself. And it’s horrible. I don’t know how anybody could see that and not be affected by it. But it doesn’t show the actual shooting.”\n\nHarris said that even if a recording showed Castile grabbing his wallet or grabbing a gearshift, that might not necessarily have swayed the trial’s outcome.\n\n“Even if you had that on video, the question is could the officer have seen that,” Harris said, noting that the standard remains: “What could a reasonable officer have seen from his or her point of view?”\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings in 2017\n\nSome gun owners are disturbed by the Philando Castile verdict.

"Jared Kushner is 'very senior' official who directed Flynn to contact Russia in court documents: Sources\nThe 'very senior' member of President Donald Trump's transition team who directed former national security adviser Michael Flynn to reach out to Russia in an attempt to delay or defeat a U.N. resolution on Israeli settlements before Trump took office was Jared Kushner, sources with knowledge of the investigation confirmed to ABC News.\n\nInterested in Russia Investigation? Add Russia Investigation as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia Investigation news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nCourt documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller today cite the “very senior” transition official but do not identify him.\n\nFlynn has promised “full cooperation” in the special counsel’s Russia investigation and is willing to testify that Donald Trump directed him to contact the Russians, initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria, according to a confidant.\n\nBloomberg first reported that Kushner was the “very senior” member of the transition team detailed in the documents released Friday after Flynn pleaded guilty to misleading FBI investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including about his contact with Russia.\n\nAn additional 'senior official' cited in the documents is K.T. McFarland, the former deputy national security adviser, sources told ABC News.\n\nThe court documents additionally detail the directions given to Flynn by a Trump transition official about how to interact with Russia regarding sanctions levied against the country by the Obama administration for Russian meddling in the election.\n\nIn the statement of the offense, accepted by Flynn Thursday and released by the special counsel's office Friday, Flynn is described as having 'called a senior official of the Presidential Transition Team who was with other senior members of the Presidential Transition Team at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. Sanctions' on Dec. 29, 2016.\n\nThat day, the Obama administration announced it was expelling 35 diplomats and placing sanctions on five Russian entities in retaliation for election meddling.\n\nFlynn initially denied that he spoke about sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, a Russian senior diplomat. That denial that was repeated by Vice President Mike Pence in January, but he later changed his story. Flynn resigned in February.\n\nThe document notes that Flynn and the official went on to converse about 'the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals' and that Flynn then called Kislyak, and 'requested that Russia not escalate the situation.'\n\nHe then relayed the details of their discussion back to the transition official.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with FBI officials on Jan. 24, just four days after Trump's inauguration, Flynn told FBI agents that he did not ask Kislyak to 'refrain from escalating the situation' in response to the sanctions, according to the court documents.\n\nIn a second instance described in the statement of offense, on Dec. 22, Flynn was directed by a 'very senior' member of the transition team to 'contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the [Israeli settlement] resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.'\n\nThat day, he called the Russian ambassador and requested that Russia 'vote against or delay the resolution,' the documents say.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn the Jan. 24 interview, he denied requesting countries take a particular action on the resolution and said that Russia's ambassador did not describe the country's position on the resolution.\n\nIn Flynn's plea agreement, he accepts the charge which carries with it a maximum prison sentence of five years and fine of $250,000, among other stipulations. He further agrees to 'cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly' with the special counsel's office and other law enforcement agencies and is required to turn over any evidence of crimes about which he has awareness.\n\nIncluded in the section on cooperation, Flynn further agrees to testify before grand juries, trials and proceedings at which his testimony is 'deemed relevant.'\n\nThe additional criminal information document details the charge brought against Flynn for 'willfully and knowingly mak[ing] materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements and representations in a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States.'\n\nIn a statement, Flynn said: 'It has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of 'treason' and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for,' the statement, dated today said.\n\n'But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.'","http://abcnews.go.com/US/senior-trump-transition-official-directed-flynn-contact-russia/story?id=51515179","None"
"U.N., European Union and Pope Criticize Trump’s Jerusalem Announcement\nThe European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, expressed concern about “the repercussions this may have on the prospect of peace.”\n\nIn a statement, she reiterated the bloc’s position that Jerusalem should be a future capital of two states, Israeli and Palestinian, and that embassies should not be moved there until the city’s final status was resolved. She cited a 1980 United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israel’s attempted annexation of East Jerusalem as a violation of international law.\n\nShe called on actors in the region “to show calm and restraint in order to prevent any escalation.”\n\nWithin a few hours of Mr. Trump’s speech, eight countries on the 15-member Security Council — including some of America’s closest allies — requested an emergency meeting to be held before the end of the week. Diplomats said it would most likely be scheduled for Friday.\n\nJoakim Vaverka, political coordinator of Sweden’s United Nations mission, said in a statement that the delegations of Bolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay had sought the meeting, including a briefing by Mr. Guterres, “in light of the statement today by the president of the United States regarding the status of Jerusalem.”\n\nThe warnings by the pope, the United Nations and the European Union spoke to a broad fear that Mr. Trump’s announcement would be the death knell for an already moribund peace process and that it would pull the plug on a two-state solution.\n\nCritics of the announcement said the change in policy removed any pretense that the United States is a neutral broker for peace. Palestinians and other Arabs in the region already view the Trump administration as leaning toward Israel’s right-wing government. The change in American policy “destroys the peace process,” said the Palestinian prime minister, Rami Hamdallah.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/europe/trump-jerusalem-pope.html","1512536400.0"
"Saleh's death redraws Yemen, sharpens Saudi-Iran rift\n(CNN) Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was President of Yemen for decades and once compared governing the country to 'dancing on the heads of snakes,' was killed on Monday at the age of 75. His death will instantly transform the political landscape in Yemen, a country that's been gripped by conflict for three years.\n\nSaleh was killed amid clashes with his erstwhile allies in Yemen -- the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. He had joined forces with the Houthis in 2014, prompting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to launch an offensive against what was never more than a marriage of convenience.\n\nFor Saleh, the marriage had recently become inconvenient. On Saturday he declared he was calling on 'the brothers in neighboring states and the alliance to stop their aggression, lift the siege, open the airports and allow food aid and the saving of the wounded.'\n\n'In return,' he promised, 'we will turn a new page by virtue of our neighborliness.'\n\nThe Houthis' political office immediately accused Saleh of staging a coup against 'an alliance he never believed in,' and warned that Saudi Arabia and its allies would 'pay a heavy price in their own capitals' -- not the first time it has threatened attacks in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.\n\nClashes between militias loyal to Saleh and Houthi gunmen have worsened an already grave humanitarian situation. More than 100 people have been killed since the fighting began, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross -- and two hospitals in Sanaa were 'running critically low' of supplies.\n\nThe exact circumstances of Saleh's death are unclear, but it will set off a bitter struggle for control of Sanaa. Saleh's supporters are led by his nephew Tareq Moahmmed Saleh, the former head of Yemen's special forces. The Houthis are effective fighters from northern Yemen who survived multiple offensives by Saleh when he was President. But they now face even more enemies, as well as airstrikes by Saudi and UAE forces.\n\nMuch will now depend on whether Saleh's allies around Sanaa are able to evict the Houthis, or whether street-by-street battles cause even more destruction.\n\nJUST WATCHED The human toll of war in Yemen Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The human toll of war in Yemen 02:34\n\nIf this is a genuine realignment of forces, and the Houthis are eventually expelled to their northern strongholds, it may bring one step closer an end to the war that has left Yemen on the verge of famine and more than two million people displaced. But there's more fighting ahead before that becomes possible.\n\nThe Iran question\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE will see the dramatic realignment in Yemen as a path to defeating the Houthis. A senior UAE official, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter that 'the events in Sanaa are murky, but its national uprising needs support ... to protect the Arabian Peninsula from Iranian expansion.'\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE see the Houthis -- a group that follows the Zaidi branch of Shia Islam -- as a proxy for Iran in a far larger contest for influence that also encompasses Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe Saudis stepped up air strikes and a blockade of Houthi-held ports after the rebels fired a ballistic missile at Riyadh airport at the beginning of November. They allege that Iran and Hezbollah -- the Lebanese Shia militia -- have provided know-how and parts to sustain the Houthi missile program.\n\nIran has denied any such involvement. However, Reuters reported last week that a UN panel had concluded that the remnants of missiles fired at Saudi Arabia were 'consistent with those reported for the Iranian designed and manufactured Qiam-1 missile.'\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that Iranian support for the Houthis amounts to 'direct military aggression' that may amount to an 'act of war.'\n\nThe question now is whether Iran and Hezbollah will deepen their backing for the isolated Houthis.\n\nThe return of a Saleh?\n\nFor decades, Saleh was Yemen's great survivor. He became the ruler of North Yemen in 1978 when the south was a separate, communist state. He was adroit in navigating Yemen's complex tribal and sectarian patchwork, and in leading unification with the south in 1990.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring in 2011, he defied massive protests in Sanaa and other cities even as he promised that he would step down. He was then nearly killed in a mortar attack -- and had to leave Yemen for medical treatment in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaleh reinjected himself into Yemen's violent and complex politics by taking sides with the Houthis. Even though he is now gone, his family remains powerful. Sources in the Gulf say the coalition may groom Saleh's son Ahmed Ali Abdullah (who was Yemen's ambassador in the UAE) for a role in Yemen, even though he is under United Nations sanctions.\n\nThe sources say that for the Saudi Crown Prince, a deal with the Saleh clan would be a price worth paying if it marginalizes the Houthis and weakens Iran's position in Yemen.\n\nBut for now, the country remains a patchwork of fiefdoms awash with weapons and plummeting towards a humanitarian disaster.\n\nThe Houthis still control important harbors such as Hodeida. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is exploiting the chaos (and the fear among Sunnis of Houthi domination); and ISIS, too, has a presence.\n\nSo fractured is Yemen -- and so desperate the humanitarian situation -- that it will take years rather than months to return the country even to a semblance of stability.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/middleeast/yemen-after-saleh-intl/index.html","1512363600.0"
"North Korea: Does latest nuclear test mean war?\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption North Korean state media announces 'hydrogen bomb' test\n\nSouth Korea says that North Korea could be preparing more missile launches after details of the isolated nation's latest test - equivalent to a 6.3 magnitude earthquake - emerged over the weekend.\n\nUS Secretary of Defence James Mattis says any threat will be met with a 'massive military response'. President Donald Trump has previously promised 'fire and fury'.\n\nIs there a diplomatic solution? Or is the crisis heading to an inevitable war?\n\nDefence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus answers your questions on North Korea and how the situation might be resolved.\n\nWill there be war?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption South Korea carries out live-fire drills in response to the nuclear test\n\nOne certainly hopes not. It is hard to imagine any conflict breaking out since the risk of escalation to all-out war would be very likely in these highly-charged times. The US is signalling strongly that the North Koreans should do nothing that might risk a conflict.\n\nAll-out war would be catastrophic in terms of lives lost. It might potentially involve the use of nuclear weapons - the first time since the closing stages of the Second World War - which could set a terrifying new precedent in international affairs.\n\nAt its close, after terrible destruction, North Korea would no longer exist. That is a given, hence the hope that the Pyongyang regime is rational and understands the risks involved.\n\nIts behaviour, though, amounts to very, very high-stakes brinksmanship.\n\nWho would be the key players and what role would they play?\n\nImage copyright Cabinet PR Office via AFP Image caption Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets US President Donald Trump in 2016\n\nInitially it would be North Korea versus the rest - South Korea and the US certainly.\n\nQuite what Japan's precise role would be is hard to say unless it had been attacked directly, but there are large numbers of US troops and bases in Japan.\n\nThe US would seek diplomatic support from the UN Security Council and, failing that, also from its allies. How far they might be involved in practical terms is hard to say. We hope this is just an academic question.\n\nCould armed conflict trigger a global nuclear war?\n\nUnlikely. A regional conflict would be bad enough.\n\nRussia, Washington's NATO allies and so on are not directly implicated. However the big question is if there was conflict, what might China do? Would it effectively intervene as it did in the 1950s to ensure the survival of the North Korean regime or would it remain on the sidelines?\n\nIt is linked to Pyongyang by a defensive treaty but this does not guarantee Chinese involvement. Again, one hopes that this question is academic.\n\nWhy can't the US accept North Korea as a nuclear power?\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption In August, President Trump said the US would meet North Korean threats with 'fire and fury'\n\nFor practical purposes, North Korea is already a nuclear power and has had a small nuclear arsenal for some time.\n\nWhat makes the current crisis more serious is that Pyongyang is now making rapid headway towards a capability to threaten the continental United States with a nuclear-armed missile.\n\nRolling back North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes may no longer be possible. In the future the emphasis may be upon deterrence and containment.\n\nPractically, the world may have little choice but to reluctantly accept North Korea as a nuclear power. But experts fear the impact this may have on the wider question of nuclear proliferation.\n\nIs there a diplomatic solution?\n\nThe exact pace of North Korea's technical progress is hard to determine.\n\nMore tests may be necessary and it is hard to know if a North Korean missile and warhead could survive the force upon re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. So they are not there yet but they are moving ever closer.\n\nUntil now, the emphasis has been upon rolling back North Korea's nuclear programme. For all the talk about seeking a diplomatic avenue - and that would presumably mean multi-national talks with Pyongyang - it is not clear what the goals of such talks would be.\n\nIs the idea to freeze North Korea's activities? To get it to halt further nuclear and missile tests? And what are the Americans in particular willing to give diplomatically (and probably economically) in return?\n\nThere have been talks with Pyongyang in the past. Deals were struck and they were implemented, at least in one case, albeit for a period. It is wrong to assert that there have never been negotiations with Pyongyang, nor that they cannot have a positive outcome. This current North Korean leadership, though, may be another problem.\n\nWhat about China?\n\nImage copyright GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Russia's President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing in 2014\n\nChina is key but it is a conflicted party. On the one hand it does not want to see a nuclear-armed North Korea and it has made its view clear to Pyongyang on many occasions.\n\nHowever, it does not want to see the North Korean regime swept away. This would result in millions of refugees flooding into China and would probably result in a unified Korea very much in the US orbit. This is seen in Beijing as worse than having a difficult nuclear neighbour.\n\nIf China were to take the view that the coincidence of a rapidly advancing North Korean nuclear programme and the uncertainties of the Trump Administration's diplomatic capabilities means that there is a very real risk of misunderstanding and catastrophe, then maybe it might bring much greater pressure to bear on Pyongyang.\n\nNorth Korea is a very isolated country and China is both its major ally and economic prop. There is a lot more that China can do. North Korea's recent testing has been as much an embarrassment to China as it has angered the US. But the Chinese have a difficult diplomatic calculation to make.\n\nChina and Russia together have tabled a diplomatic roadmap that proposes the de-nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and a peace deal to end the Korean War. In the interim, they say that North Korea should suspend its nuclear and missile testing and that the US and South Korea should suspend large scale military exercises.\n\nNorth Korea has not shown any interest in this proposal, at least publicly, and the Americans have dismissed it - in the words of US UN Ambassador Nikki Haley - as 'insulting'.\n\nProduced by Chris Bell, UGC and Social News team","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41150291","None"
"In North Korea, ‘Surgical Strike’ Could Spin Into ‘Worst Kind of Fighting’\n“You have this massive agglomeration of everything that is important in South Korea — government, business and the huge population — and all of it is in this gigantic megalopolis that starts 30 miles from the border and ends 70 miles from the border,” said Robert E. Kelly, a professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea. “In terms of national security, it’s just nuts.”\n\nNorth Korea has positioned as many as 8,000 artillery cannons and rocket launchers on its side of the Demilitarized Zone, analysts say, an arsenal capable of raining up to 300,000 rounds on the South in the first hour of a counterattack. That means it can inflict tremendous damage without resorting to weapons of mass destruction.\n\nMr. Kim could order a limited response, by hitting a base near the Demilitarized Zone, for example, and then pausing before doing more. But most analysts expect the North would escalate quickly if attacked, to inflict as much damage as possible in case the United States and South Korea were preparing an invasion.\n\n“North Korea knows it is the end game and will not go down without a fight,” said Jeffrey W. Hornung of the RAND Corporation, adding, “I think it is going to be a barrage.”\n\nThe North has often threatened to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire,” but the vast majority of its artillery has a range of three to six miles and cannot reach the city, analysts say.\n\nThe North has deployed at least three systems, though, that can reach the Seoul metropolitan area: Koksan 170-millimeter guns and 240-millimeter multiple-rocket launchers capable of hitting the northern suburbs and parts of the city, and 300-millimeter multiple-rocket launchers, which may be able to hit targets beyond Seoul.\n\nThere are perhaps 1,000 such weapons near the Demilitarized Zone, many hidden in caves, tunnels and bunkers. But under a traditional artillery strategy, the North would not fire them all at once. Instead, it would hold some in reserve to avoid giving their positions away and to conserve munitions.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/world/asia/north-korea-south-us-nuclear-war.html","1499227200.0"
"Climate talks close with Trump administration on one track, world on another\nJake Schmidt, director of the international program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, assessed the panel's reception. “One of the positive things here is that the Trump administration has mostly been ignored,' he said.\n\nRelated: Trump Panel to Diverge From Views of Other Americans at Bonn Climate Talks\n\nMuch of the world community — from Pope Francis, to French President Emmanuel Macron, to a giant Norwegian investment fund — made it clear they agreed with the American dissenters.\n\nThe annual conference had been expected to highlight deep divisions not only between the United States and foreign nations, but also between U.S. federal and local governments. Despite the Trump administration's vows to bring back coal jobs, some American states and communities are moving forward aggressively to get more of their electricity from wind and solar installations. They made multiple presentations at the world conclave.\n\nRelated: California and Other States Step Into the Climate Policy Void\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in June that the U.S. would exit as a participant in the Paris climate accord, putting the world's second-biggest carbon producer at odds with governments around the world.\n\nIn the Paris deal, nations agreed that they would change policies and practices to try to limit the increase in Earth temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). An array of measures are needed to meet that goal, such as slowing rapid deforestation and slashing the use of coal and gas, both to make electricity and to power cars and trucks.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron attend the COP 23 United Nations Climate Change Conference on Nov. 15, 2017 in Bonn, Germany. Anthony Kwan / Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. was represented by career State Department diplomats and only made one presentation headed by a Trump representative — leading a panel of representatives from the coal, nuclear and natural gas industries.\n\n“Without question, fossil fuels will continue to be used, and we would argue that it’s in the global interest to make sure when fossil fuels are used that they be as clean and efficient as possible,” Trump representative David Banks told the gathering. “This panel is controversial only if we chose to bury our heads in the sand.”\n\nThat panel was interrupted for about 10 minutes by protesters, who accused the U.S. president of neglecting the world's most existential threat. When the demonstrators left, the meeting hall was left with many empty seats.\n\nThe U.S. wrapped up its official role in the sessions Thursday, with a presentation by veteran State Department official Judith Garber. She said America would continue to rely on a variety of fuels to provide “energy security [and] promotion of economic growth.”\n\nCoal backers claim it is more dependable than wind, solar and cleaner energy sources — a position that environmentalists reject.\n\nRelated: How to Save an Island Drowning From Climate Change\n\nGarber told the gathering that, despite the plan to exit the Paris accord, “We remain open to the possibility of rejoining at a later date under terms more favorable to the American people.” She added that the U.S. “will continue to be a leader in clean energy and innovation, and we understand the need for transforming energy systems.”\n\nThe pope was one of several leaders signaling they wanted a more aggressive approach. Francis' statement called global warming “one of the most worrisome phenomena that humanity is facing.”\n\nWhile Trump has previously threatened to withdraw funding for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, French President Macron told the Bonn gathering he will make sure the the group 'won't lack a single euro' for its climate work.\n\nAnother signal of the anti-carbon momentum came when Britain and Canada announced a new alliance intended to phase out coal. Participants in the Global Alliance to Power Past Coal ranged from Finland and Mexico to New Zealand and several U.S. states.\n\nThe Norwegian firm signalling its support of clean energy, Storebrand, said it was divesting carbon-centric energy companies from its $80 billion portfolio.\n\nThe mixed message out of Bonn should not be a surprise, said Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor of natural resource economics who has studied international agreements for 30 years.\n\n“It really is amazing the world at least stands united,” Barrett said. “But the successes they are talking about have to be put in the context of what really matters, which is the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And that has gone up every year since it was first measured in 1957.”","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/climate-talks-close-trump-administration-one-track-world-another-n821536","None"

"World faces worst humanitarian crisis since 1945, says UN official\nTwenty million people face starvation without an immediate injection of funds in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria, warns Stephen O’Brien\n\nThe world faces the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of the second world war with more than 20 million people in four countries facing starvation and famine, a senior United Nations official has warned.\n\nWithout collective and coordinated global efforts, “people will simply starve to death” and “many more will suffer and die from disease”, Stephen O’Brien, the UN under secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the security council in New York on Friday.\n\nHe urged an immediate injection of funds for Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and northeast Nigeria plus safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid “to avert a catastrophe.”\n\n'Where is the help?': black tea and dark despair as Somalia edges closer to famine Read more\n\n“To be precise,” O’Brien said, “we need $4.4bn by July”.\n\nUnless there was a major infusion of money, he said, children would be stunted by severe malnutrition and would not be able to go to school, gains in economic development would be reversed and “livelihoods, futures and hope lost”.\n\nUN and food organisations define famine as when more than 30% of children under age 5 suffer from acute malnutrition and mortality rates are two or more deaths per 10,000 people every day, among other criteria.\n\n“Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations [in 1945],” O’Brien said. “Now, more than 20 million people across four countries face starvation and famine.”\n\nO’Brien said the largest humanitarian crisis was in Yemen where two-thirds of the population — 18.8 million people — need aid and more than seven million people are hungry and did not know where their next meal would come from. “That is three million people more than in January,” he said.\n\nFamine warning signs were clear – so why are 20 million lives now at risk? | Kevin Watkins Read more\n\nYemen is engulfed in conflict as Saudi Arabia and Iran wage a proxy war in the Arab world’s poorest nation. O’Brien said more than 48,000 people fled fighting just in the past two months.\n\nDuring his recent visit to Yemen, O’Brien said he met senior leaders of the Saudi-backed government and the Tehran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels who control the capital Sanaa, and all promised access for aid.\n\n“Yet all parties to the conflict are arbitrarily denying sustained humanitarian access and politicise aid,” he said, warning if that behaviour did not change “they must be held accountable for the inevitable famine, unnecessary deaths and associated amplification in suffering that will follow”.\n\nFor 2017, O’Brien said $2.1bn was needed to reach 12 million Yemenis “with life-saving assistance and protection” but only 6% has been received so far. He announced that secretary-general Antonio Guterres will chair a pledging conference for Yemen on 25 April in Geneva.\n\nThe UN humanitarian chief also visited South Sudan, the world’s newest nation which has been ravaged by a three-year civil war, and said “the situation is worse than it has ever been.”\n\n“The famine in South Sudan is man-made,” he said. “Parties to the conflict are parties to the famine — as are those not intervening to make the violence stop.”\n\nO’Brien said more than 7.5 million people need aid, up by 1.4 million from last year, and about 3.4 million South Sudanese are displaced by fighting including almost 200,000 who have fled the country since January.\n\n“More than one million children are estimated to be acutely malnourished across the country, including 270,000 children who face the imminent risk of death should they not be reached in time with assistance,” he said. “Meanwhile, the cholera outbreak that began in June 2016 has spread to more locations.”\n\nIn Somalia, which O’Brien also visited, more than half the population — 6.2 million people — need humanitarian assistance and protection, including 2.9 million who are at risk of famine and require immediate help “to save or sustain their lives.”\n\nSurviving South Sudan's escalating violence: life in a UN camp – in pictures Read more\n\nHe warned that close to one million children under the age of five would be “acutely malnourished” this year.\n\n“What I saw and heard during my visit to Somalia was distressing — women and children walk for weeks in search of food and water. They have lost their livestock, water sources have dried up and they have nothing left to survive on,” O’Brien said. “With everything lost, women, boys, girls and men now move to urban centers.”\n\nHe said current indicators mirror “the tragic picture of 2011 when Somalia last suffered a famine”. But he said the UN’s humanitarian partners have a larger footprint, better controls on resources, and a stronger partnership with the new government which recently declared the drought a national disaster.\n\n“To be clear, we can avert a famine,” O’Brien said. “We’re ready despite incredible risk and danger ... but we need those huge funds now.”\n\nIn north-east Nigeria, a seven-year uprising by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people and driven 2.6 million from their homes. A UN humanitarian coordinator said last month that malnutrition in the north-east is so pronounced that some adults are too weak to walk and some communities have lost all their toddlers.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/11/world-faces-worst-humanitarian-crisis-since-1945-says-un-official","1489208400.0"
"She Broke Japan’s Silence on Rape\nAs the United States reckons with an outpouring of sexual misconduct cases that have shaken Capitol Hill, Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the news media, Ms. Ito’s story is a stark example of how sexual assault remains a subject to be avoided in Japan, where few women report rape to the police and when they do, their complaints rarely result in arrests or prosecution.\n\nOn paper, Japan boasts relatively low rates of sexual assault. In a survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of the central government in 2014, one in 15 women reported experiencing rape at some time in their lives, compared with one in five women who report having been raped in the United States.\n\nBut scholars say Japanese women are far less likely to describe nonconsensual sex as rape than women in the West. Japan’s rape laws make no mention of consent, date rape is essentially a foreign concept and education about sexual violence is minimal.\n\nInstead, rape is often depicted in manga comics and pornography as an extension of sexual gratification, in a culture in which such material is often an important channel of sex education.\n\nThe police and courts tend to define rape narrowly, generally pursuing cases only when there are signs of both physical force and self-defense and discouraging complaints when either the assailant or victim has been drinking.\n\nLast month, prosecutors in Yokohama dropped a case against six university students accused of sexually assaulting another student after forcing her to drink alcohol.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd even when rapists are prosecuted and convicted in Japan, they sometimes serve no prison time; about one in 10 receive only suspended sentences, according to Justice Ministry statistics.\n\nThis year, for example, two students at Chiba University near Tokyo convicted in the gang rape of an intoxicated woman were released with suspended sentences, though other defendants were sentenced to prison. Last fall, a Tokyo University student convicted in another group sexual assault was also given a suspended sentence.\n\n“It’s quite recent that activists started to raise the ‘No Means No’ campaign,” said Mari Miura, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. “So I think Japanese men get the benefit from this lack of consciousness about the meaning of consent.”\n\nOf the women who reported experiencing rape in the Cabinet Office survey, more than two-thirds said they had never told anyone, not even a friend or family member. And barely 4 percent said they had gone to the police. By contrast, in the United States, about a third of rapes are reported to the police, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\n“Prejudice against women is deep-rooted and severe, and people don’t consider the damage from sexual crimes seriously at all,” said Tomoe Yatagawa, a lecturer in gender law at Waseda University.\n\nMs. Ito, 28, who has filed a civil suit against Mr. Yamaguchi, agreed to discuss her case in detail to highlight the challenges faced by women who suffer sexual violence in Japan.\n\n“I know if I didn’t talk about it, this horrible climate of sexual assault will never change,” she said.\n\nMr. Yamaguchi, 51, also agreed to speak for this article. He denied committing rape. “There was no sexual assault,” he said. “There was no criminal activity that night.”\n\nPhoto\n\n‘Not a Chance’\n\nMs. Ito had met Mr. Yamaguchi twice while studying journalism in New York before their encounter on April 3, 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she contacted him again in Tokyo, he suggested that he might be able to help her find a job in his bureau, she said. He invited her for drinks and then dinner at Kiichi, a sushi restaurant in the trendy Ebisu neighborhood.\n\nTo her surprise, they dined alone, following beer with sake. At some point, she felt dizzy, went to the bathroom, laid her head on the toilet tank and blacked out, she said.\n\nWhen she woke, Ms. Ito said, she was underneath Mr. Yamaguchi in his hotel bed, naked and in pain.\n\nJapanese law describes the crime of “quasi-rape” as sexual intercourse with a woman by “taking advantage of loss of consciousness or inability to resist.” In the United States, the law varies from state to state, with some defining the same crime as second-degree rape or sexual assault.\n\nThe police later located a taxi driver who recalled picking up Ms. Ito and Mr. Yamaguchi and taking them to the nearby Sheraton Miyako Hotel, where Mr. Yamaguchi was staying.\n\nThe driver said Ms. Ito was conscious at first and asked to be taken to a subway station, according to a transcript of an interview with the driver. Mr. Yamaguchi, however, instructed him to take them to his hotel.\n\nThe driver recalled Mr. Yamaguchi saying that they had more work to discuss. He also said Mr. Yamaguchi might have said something like, “I won’t do anything.”\n\nWhen they pulled up to the hotel, the driver said, Ms. Ito had “gone silent” for about five minutes and he discovered that she had vomited in the back seat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The man tried to move her over toward the door, but she did not move,” the driver said, according to the transcript. “So he got off first and put his bags on the ground, and he slid his shoulder under her arm and tried to pull her out of the car. It looked to me like she was unable to walk on her own.”\n\nMs. Ito also appears incapacitated in hotel security camera footage obtained by the police. In pictures from the footage seen by The New York Times, Mr. Yamaguchi is propping her up as they move through the lobby around 11:20 p.m.\n\nMs. Ito said it was about 5 a.m. when she woke up. She said she wriggled out from under Mr. Yamaguchi and ran to the bathroom. When she came out, she said, “he tried to push me down to the bed and he’s a man and he was quite strong and he pushed me down and I yelled at him.”\n\nShe said she demanded to know what had happened and whether he had used a condom. He told her to calm down, she said, and offered to buy her a morning-after pill.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Gender Letter A new newsletter on women, gender and culture.

If she could have controlled herself, then nothing would have happened.”\n\nMr. Yamaguchi said he had brought her to his hotel because he was worried that she would not make it home. He had to rush back to his room, he said, to meet a deadline in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Yamaguchi acknowledged that “it was inappropriate” to take Ms. Ito to his room but said, “It would have been inappropriate to leave her at the station or in the hotel lobby.”\n\nHe declined to describe what happened next, citing the advice of his lawyers. But in court documents filed in response to Ms. Ito’s civil suit, he said he undressed her to clean her up and laid her on one of the beds in his room. Later, he added, she woke and knelt by his bed to apologize.\n\nMr. Yamaguchi said in the documents that he urged her to return to bed, then sat on her bed and initiated sex. He said she was conscious and did not protest or resist.\n\nBut in emails that he exchanged with Ms. Ito after that night, he presented a slightly different account, writing that she had climbed into his bed.\n\n“So it’s not the truth at all that I had sex with you while you were unconscious,” he said in a message on April 18, 2015. “I was quite drunk and an attractive woman like you came into my bed half naked, and we ended up like that. I think we both should examine ourselves.”\n\nIn another email, Mr. Yamaguchi denied Ms. Ito’s allegation of rape and suggested that they consult lawyers. “Even if you insist it was quasi-rape, there is not a chance that you can win,” he wrote.\n\nWhen asked about the emails, Mr. Yamaguchi said a full record of his conversations and correspondence with Ms. Ito would demonstrate that he had “had no intention” of using his position to seduce her.\n\n“I am the one who was caused trouble by her,” he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nShame and Hesitation\n\nMs. Ito said she rushed home to wash after leaving the hotel. She now regards that as a mistake. “I should have just gone to the police,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer hesitation is typical. Many Japanese women who have been assaulted “blame themselves, saying, ‘Oh, it’s probably my fault,’” said Tamie Kaino, a professor emeritus of gender studies at Ochanomizu University.\n\nHisako Tanabe, a rape counselor at the Sexual Assault Relief Center in Tokyo, said that even women who call their hotline and are advised to go to the police often refuse, because they do not expect the police to believe them.\n\n“They think they will be told they did something wrong,” she said.\n\nMs. Ito said she felt ashamed and considered keeping quiet too, wondering if tolerating such treatment was necessary to succeed in Japan’s male-dominated media industry. But she decided to go to the police five days after the encounter.\n\n“If I don’t face the truth,” she recalled thinking, “I think I won’t be able to work as a journalist.”\n\nThe police officers she spoke to initially discouraged her from filing a complaint and expressed doubt about her story because she was not crying as she told it, she said. Some added that Mr. Yamaguchi’s status would make it difficult for her to pursue the case, she said.\n\nBut Ms. Ito said the police eventually took her seriously after she urged them to view the hotel security footage.\n\nA two-month investigation followed, after which the lead detective called her in Berlin, where she was working on a freelance project, she said. He told her they were preparing to arrest Mr. Yamaguchi on the strength of the taxi driver’s testimony, the hotel security video and tests that found his DNA on one of her bras.\n\nThe detective said Mr. Yamaguchi would be apprehended at the airport on June 8, 2015, after arriving in Tokyo on a flight from Washington, and he asked her to return to Japan to help with questioning, Ms. Ito said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen that day came, though, the investigator called again. He told her that he was inside the airport but that a superior had just called him and ordered him not to make the arrest, Ms. Ito said.\n\n“I asked him, ‘How is that possible?’” she said. “But he couldn’t answer my question.”\n\nMs. Ito declined to identify the investigator, saying she wanted to protect him. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police would not comment on whether plans to arrest Mr. Yamaguchi were scuttled. “We have conducted a necessary investigation in light of all laws and sent all documents and evidence to the Tokyo Prosecutors’ office,” a spokesman said.\n\nPhoto\n\n‘I Have to Be Strong’\n\nIn 2016, the most recent year for which government statistics are available, the police confirmed 989 cases of rape in Japan, or about 1.5 cases for every 100,000 women. By comparison, there were 114,730 cases of rape in the United States, according to F.B.I. statistics, or about 41 cases per 100,000 residents, both male and female.\n\nScholars say the disparity is less about actual crime rates than a reflection of underreporting by victims and the attitudes of the police and prosecutors in Japan.\n\nOver the summer, Parliament passed the first changes to Japan’s sex crime laws in 110 years, expanding the definition of rape to include oral and anal sex and including men as potential victims. Lawmakers also lengthened minimum sentences. But the law still does not mention consent, and judges can still suspend sentences.\n\nAnd despite the recent cases, there is still little education about sexual violence at universities. At Chiba, a course for new students refers to the recent gang rape as an “unfortunate case” and only vaguely urges students not to commit crimes.\n\nIn Ms. Ito’s case, there is also a question of whether Mr. Yamaguchi received favorable treatment because of his connection to the prime minister.\n\nNot long after Ms. Ito went public with her allegations, a Japanese journalist, Atsushi Tanaka, confronted a top Tokyo police official about the case.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe official, Itaru Nakamura, a former aide to Mr. Abe’s chief cabinet secretary, confirmed that investigators were prepared to arrest Mr. Yamaguchi — and that he had stopped them, Mr. Tanaka reported in Shukan Shincho, a weekly newsmagazine.\n\nThe allegations did not affect Mr. Yamaguchi’s position at the Tokyo Broadcasting System, but he resigned last year under pressure from the network after publishing an article that was seen as contentious. He continues to work as a freelance journalist in Japan.\n\nMs. Ito published a book about her experience in October. It has received only modest attention in Japan’s mainstream news media.\n\nIsoko Mochizuki, one of the few journalists to investigate Ms. Ito’s allegations, said she faced resistance from male colleagues in her newsroom, some of whom dismissed the story because Ms. Ito had not gone to the hospital immediately.\n\n“The press never covers sexual assault very much,” she said.\n\nMs. Ito said that was precisely why she wanted to speak out.\n\n“I still feel like I have to be strong,” she said, “and just keep talking about why this is not O.K.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html","1514523600.0"
"Q&A: Rep. Frederica Wilson details the problems with Trump's condolence call and the Kelly clean up\nAs is often the case in the age of Trump, the list of problems born of what the president has said and what it may mean is long this week.\n\nFirst, Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) said that President Trump, while offering his condolences to the young, pregnant widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson, said that the soldier “knew what he signed up for.” Then came the president’s counterclaims that he never said any such thing and “had proof.” Besides, the president insisted, most presidents — including Barack Obama — did not call dead soldiers’ survivors at all.\n\nSince then, Johnson’s mother has also said Trump used the “knew what he signed up for” language during that call. And Trump’s claim that previous presidents didn’t make calls has been disputed.\n\n[What John Kelly got wrong about Rep. Frederica Wilson and the Johnson family]\n\nNow the administration has taken aim at Wilson. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly said the congresswoman took credit for bringing a $20 million FBI field office building to Florida at a public ceremony in 2015. He said Wilson had played no such role and likened her to “empty barrels making the most noise.”\n\nBut again, there was a problem. Wilson noted she wasn’t even in Congress when lawmakers allocated money for the building in 2009. Instead, she and others, including then-FBI Director James B. Comey, spoke about her role in getting the building named in honor of two slain FBI agents. Video of Wilson’s 2015 speech disproved Kelly’s account.\n\nThe Washington Post interviewed Wilson about the phone call at the center of a Trump-made storm and the problems created by what happened afterward. What follows is a Q&A with Wilson, edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: What precisely did you hear the president say to Sgt. Johnson’s family, and how did you come to hear it?\n\nA: I was accompanying the Johnson family on the trip to the airport to greet Sgt. Johnson’s coffin when President Trump called to offer condolences to his widow, Myeshia Johnson. The call took place on speakerphone. I heard him say something to the effect of Sgt. Johnson “knew what he was getting into. but I guess it still hurts,” as if to say that’s what you get. He did ask her to reach out if she needs anything but also kept calling Sgt. Johnson “your guy,” instead of saying his name or acknowledging that this was her husband.\n\nQ: What was your initial reaction when you heard the president suggest that Sgt. Johnson “knew what he was getting into?”\n\nA: I was shocked when I heard the statement and shocked that a president of the United States could be so callous and cavalier toward a grieving young wife and mother. Then I grew angry, especially when I saw Myeshia’s heartbreak all over again. Sgt. Johnson was only 25. He is the father of two with a baby on the way. The purpose of such a call is to offer condolences and honor the immeasurable sacrifice that he and his family have made in service to this country. President Trump’s remarks had the opposite effect.\n\nQ: Did you see or hear the family react in any way to that portion of the conversation?\n\nA: The family was just as astonished by his remarks. Myeshia dissolved into tears, not only because of his blatant insensitivity, but also because Mr. Trump appeared to not even know her husband’s name. In an interview the next day, he referred to her as “the woman” and “the wife.” The whole incident was a disgrace.\n\nQ: The president has made a number of comments that have made people question whether he is lacking in empathy, particularly lacking in empathy for nonwhite Americans or somehow unable to express any empathy that he may have. What do you make of this argument?\n\nA: I definitely believe that Mr. Trump lacks empathy and compassion and in some instances common sense. How else can one explain the horrific sight of him free-throwing rolls of paper towels into a crowd of people who were desperate for the most basic staples and resources? Let’s also not forget the Virgin Islands. While his response to hurricane victims in Texas and my home state of Florida was admirable, he has left hanging those living in American territories who happen to be primarily people of color.\n\nMr. Trump is more interested in winning and will do or say whatever he believes is necessary to bring him closer to that goal, especially if it helps keep his base support intact. That is why, when the violence erupted in Charlottesville, he tried to equate white supremacists with those protesting overt historical and contemporary racism. It is also why he is so outraged by the NFL players taking a knee to protest racial inequities. In fact, he’s been much harder on them than on white nationalists.\n\nSgt. Johnson and his fellow slain soldiers were killed during an ambush in West Africa. They were part of the elite U.S. Special Operations Command, so I cannot imagine that Mr. Trump was not quickly informed. And still, he golfed for two days and took several days to acknowledge their deaths. That says a lot.\n\nQ: So when White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, and Trump begin criticizing you this week for listening to the call and describing your decision to share what you heard as unconscionable, what did you think?\n\nA: I think it’s a stunning mischaracterization of the actual facts. General Kelly has deservedly earned a reputation as an honorable man who has served our country well. It was extremely disappointing to hear him criticize my motives because I was with the family to provide comfort and support.\n\nHis distortion of the facts surrounding my speech at the dedication of the FBI building was unconscionable and frankly untrue, and unfortunately extended this story for another news cycle. The focus should instead be on honoring Sgt. Johnson’s memory and investigating the circumstances surrounding the ambush in Niger so we can provide closure to the four families who lost loved ones.\n\nWhat both General Kelly and Mr. Trump fail to understand is that despite the president’s best intention, his words and the tone in which he delivered them did not provide solace to Myeshia Johnson. She is a young woman who has suffered an immeasurable loss, and it is incomprehensible to me why they ever believed that the words used by his best friend to comfort General Kelly — both military officers — when he tragically lost his son would have the same effect on a grieving widow who, in a few months, will deliver the couple’s third child without her husband.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/10/21/qa-rep-frederica-wilson-details-the-problems-with-trumps-condolence-call-and-the-kelly-clean-up/","1508558400.0"

"Saving history from ISIS destruction\nHis tools are different and the task is sometimes dangerous, but Fr. Columba Stewart's mission saving historic texts from the destruction of ISIS and the war against it follows a tradition practiced by his Benedictine order for more than a thousand years. Lesley Stahl accompanies Fr. Columba on his modern-day mission in a Middle East war zone for a 60 Minutes report to be broadcast Sunday, Dec. 24 at 7:00 p.m., ET/PT.\n\nFr. Columba is a monk at Saint John's Abbey and University in Collegeville, Minnesota, where he heads up a library containing the world's largest digital collection of religious and historic texts. 60 Minutes cameras followed him to a centuries-old monastery in Northern Iraq, occupied and defaced by ISIS, which is known for destroying Christian and Muslim sites and artifacts. Before its monks fled ISIS, they safely hid much of the monastery's precious texts in barrels concealed behind a fake wall.\n\n'So it's the one thing that they couldn't replace because you could rebuild a building. You can put a new cross up,' he tells Stahl. 'Those could not be replaced, and those were saved,' he says, pointing to the hand-written documents, including Bibles and scientific works from the 12th Century.\n\nThe Benedictines, like other monastics, hand-wrote bibles and other religious texts to preserve and teach the faith. Fr. Columba and his partner, an Iraqi Dominican priest, Fr. Najeeb Michaeel, find such religious texts and secular documents as well. Some are in good condition, like those hidden away. Others must be salvaged from the ruins, often scarred by weather, fire and explosions.\n\nThe documents are relocated for safekeeping near the areas where they are recovered. Fr. Columba will take the photos of them back to St. John's Abbey to add to the collection. It's more than a religious mission, he explains. 'These aren't all religious manuscripts. So some of them are purely history -- so those are ones that tell us about political events, and kings, and battles, and famines. It's not simply history of religion, it's history of every aspect of life,' says Fr. Columba.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saving-history-from-isis-destruction/","None"
"#MeToo Movement Is Person Of The Year, 'Time' Says\n#MeToo Movement Is Person Of The Year, 'Time' Says\n\nIt has created a wave of awareness and brave confrontations over sexual harassment and assault, taking down powerful men in the process. And now the #MeToo movement has been named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2017.\n\nOn its cover, Time called the people behind the movement 'The Silence Breakers.' Its story features women and men who have spoken out — including activist Tarana Burke, who started the hashtag 10 years ago.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Time magazine Time magazine\n\n#MeToo rose to prominence as a social media campaign in the wake of high-profile accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. After actress Alyssa Milano popularized the hashtag, thousands of women began sharing their stories about the pervasive damage wrought by sexual harassment and by 'open secrets' about abuse.\n\nThe movement's empowering reach could be seen in the platform on which Time announced its choice: the Today show. It was just one week ago that NBC fired the morning program's longtime and powerful co-host, Matt Lauer, over a detailed complaint of 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.'\n\nWhile the most high-profile #MeToo stories have come from women and men who work in the movies and media, the Time article also features women who work hourly jobs, some of whom want to remain anonymous. The magazine's cover portrait includes strawberry picker Isabel Pascual, lobbyist Adama Iwu and former Uber engineer Susan Fowler along with Ashley Judd and Taylor Swift.\n\n'The reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries,' Time's Stephanie Zacharek, Eliana Dockterman and Haley Sweetland Edwards write. 'Women have had it with bosses and coworkers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist.'\n\nMarking a possible cultural shift back in October, NPR's Sarah McCammon quoted associate professor Lisa Huebner saying of #MeToo, 'It helps a lot of people individually, I think, and it also will help us to mark publicly that this is a widespread occurrence, and it's not OK.'\n\nThe shortlist of candidates for the distinction included:\n\nThe Dreamers\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos\n\nWonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un\n\nProtest leader Colin Kaepernick\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia\n\nPresident Trump\n\nTime also conducted a reader poll, which the magazine says was won by Mohammed bin Salman, with 24 percent of the votes. Second place went to the #MeToo movement, followed by a three-way tie among Kaepernick, Mueller and the Dreamers.\n\nIn the magazine's tally, Trump was the runner-up.\n\nThe final decision comes weeks after Trump — who was named Person of the Year in 2016 — said he 'took a pass' on being named again in 2017. Trump, who had called it 'a tremendous honor' to win last year, said the magazine had been in touch to say he would 'probably' win.\n\nThe president's comment prompted Time to clarify, 'The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year.

"Trump's Latest Charlottesville Remarks Are Condemned Abroad\n'I thought what took place was a horrible moment for the country, but there are two sides to a story,' he said, threatening to undo any goodwill built by his condemnation of neo-Nazi groups the previous day.\n\nThe rally in Charlottesville culminated with 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly plowing his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, injuring 19 and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nAt home, the backlash to Trump's latest remarks has been widespread, including by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOpinion has been no less scathing abroad.\n\nThe hashtag #ImpeachTrump was among the top worldwide Twitter trends early Wednesday, with people across the world using it to lodge their protest.\n\nThe hashtag was also used by some of Trump's defiant supporters.\n\nThe astonishment at the president's remarks has been particularly stark in Germany — where Nazi flags and salutes have been banned since the end of World War II.\n\n'Trump's trivializing reaction to Charlottesville is unbearable,' German justice minister Heiko Maas said in a tweet. 'That was anti-Semitism and racism.'\n\nThere was a similar reaction from the German fundraising group Hass Hilft, meaning 'Hate Helps,' which donates 1 euro to refugee projects for every racist and xenophobic comment it finds online.\n\n'If you are a U.S. president, and a former Ku Klux Klan leader thanks you, then you definitely did everything wrong,' the group said, referring to a tweet by former KKK leader David Duke.\n\nTrude Simonsohn, a 97-year-old Holocaust survivor living in Frankfurt, said Trump's words 'will only encourage these [far-right] groups.'\n\nShe added: 'I am tired of listening to Donald Trump. I can't understand why Americans elected him.'\n\nIn Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May had been criticized for saying Monday that while she condemned racism and the far-right, 'what the president says is a matter for him.'\n\nBut on Wednesday, following the president's latest press conference, leading members of her own party broke ranks to voice their displeasure.\n\nLilian Greenwood, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, called Trump's remarks 'sickening' and 'a new low' for the president.\n\nFollowing these interjections, May herself weighed in. 'I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them. I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views,' May told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe situation has also sparked renewed calls for the British prime minister to withdraw her invitation for Trump to come to the U.K. for a state visit.\n\n'Theresa May’s decision to invite Donald Trump for a state visit to the U.K. has always been highly controversial,' according to the London-based campaign group Global Justice Now. 'But now that the president is nakedly sympathizing with neo-Nazis, there has never been a more obvious time that that invitation must be rescinded immediately.'\n\nIn February, the British prime minister rejected a petition signed by 1.8 million people that called for Trump's proposed state visit to be scrapped because it would 'cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.'\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan backed this campaign following Trump's widely criticized response to an attack in London. Trump remains invited but no official date has been set.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-s-latest-charlottesville-remarks-are-condemned-abroad-n793081","None"
"White House warns of potential US 'red line' over Syria barrel bomb attacks\nCriteria would mark substantial expansion of rules of engagement, as Rex Tillerson says US would come to defense of civilians ‘anywhere’ amid G7 talks\n\nThe Trump administration has signalled much broader grounds for future military intervention in Syria, suggesting it might retaliate against the Assad regime for barrel bomb attacks.\n\nOn the eve of a critical visit to Moscow at a time of high US-Russian tensions over Syria, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, appeared to go even further, saying his country would come to the defence of innocent civilians “anywhere in the world”.\n\nThe administration had initially stressed strictly limited objectives for a cruise missile strike last week on a Syrian air force base, saying it was intended to deter the repeat of a chemical attack on Tuesday against civilians and that the focus of US efforts in Syria remains combating the Islamic State (Isis).\n\n'The dead were wherever you looked': inside Syrian town after chemical attack Read more\n\nOn Monday, however, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, widened the criteria for retaliation. “When you watch babies and children being gassed, and suffer under barrel bombs, you are instantaneously moved to action,” he said. “I think this president’s made it very clear that if those actions were to continue, further action will definitely be considered by the United States.”\n\nOn Tuesday diplomats gathered in Italy for a second day of G7 talks dominated by the war in Syria, as officials in Washington, the UK and elsewhere floated the possibility of new sanctions on the Syrian and Russian military.\n\nUS intelligence believes Assad carried out last week’s attack with the chemical agent sarin, killing dozens of civilians including children. But Spicer made the first mention of the use of barrel bombs – crude munitions that can cause indiscriminate casualties.\n\nPressed on whether chemical warfare as opposed to conventional warfare constitutes a red line, he replied: “I think the president’s been very clear that there were a number of lines crossed last week ... The answer is if you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president. That is unacceptable.”\n\nThe White House said later that Spicer was referring to barrel bombs carrying industrial chemicals like chlorine. But that would still represent a substantial expansion of the US rules of engagement in Syria. The regime is suspected of using chlorine gas in its attacks on dozens of occasions since 2013.\n\nTillerson made his remarks during a visit to the site of a 1944 Nazi massacre in Italy, but they clearly referred to the Trump administration’s decision on Thursday to launch missile strikes against a Syrian airbase from which the US said a regime chemical attack had been launched against civilians in a rebel-held town.\n\nTillerson is in Italy for a G7 foreign ministers’ meeting dominated by discussion of western policy towards Damascus and Moscow. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who cancelled his own planned visit to Moscow on Monday, said the ministers would be “discussing the possibility of further sanctions certainly on some of the Syrian military figures and indeed on some of the Russian military figures who have been involved in coordinating the Syrian military effort”.\n\nThe ministers met again early on Tuesday Morning before Tillerson flies on to Moscow. According to one G7 source, Tillerson plans to offer the Putin regime a bald choice, between cutting Bashar al-Assad loose and being rewarded with a thaw in relations with the west; or continuing to back him, and risking a Libyan-style outcome. The Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, was violently deposed and killed in 2011 by rebels lent air support by Nato powers, including the UK.\n\nWhitehall sources say Britain has been instrumental in helping to persuade the US to support the idea that Assad – and his family – must be removed from power before progress can be made. Johnson is pushing for the strongest possible conclusion, including the threat of targeted sanctions against Syrian and Russian military commanders – a proposal he judges more likely to win support than wider economic penalties against Moscow.\n\nThe decision to approve the missile strike on the Shayrat Syrian air force base marked a sharp change in direction for Donald Trump, who had furiously opposed any such intervention by the Obama administration, and had pledged an “America first” foreign policy that would focus on counter-terrorism and narrowly defined US national interests.\n\nTrump emphasised the child victims of the poison gas in justifying the launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles aimed at infrastructure at the Shayrat base, Spicer’s comments suggested the president’s concern for Syrian children extended to victims of conventional bombing too. Over half a million people have been killed in the six years of the Syrian war. Tillerson’s comments suggested that the administration was even open to humanitarian intervention elsewhere.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rex Tillerson and Boris Johnson hold talks in Lucca. Photograph: Max Rossi/Reuters\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the site of the 1944 massacre in the Tuscan village of Sant’Anna, the secretary of state said: “We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe remarks appeared to conflict with Tillerson’s own comments on Sunday in which he claimed the administration’s priority in Syria had not changed; it remained the defeat of Isis, and only after that could Syria’s political stability be considered. On the same today, the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said “getting Assad out” was one of “multiple priorities” held by the administration.\n\nMike Dubke, Trump’s communications director, conceded at a meeting of White House staffers last Tuesday before the missile strike that the president lacked a coherent foreign policy and said that “there is no Trump doctrine”, according to an account of the meeting by Politico.\n\n“It’s head-spinning,” said Philip Gordon, a special assistant to the president on the Middle East in the Obama administration. “They went from vehement opposition to any kind of military intervention to executing those strikes and saying that’s what we would be doing any time chemical weapons are used.\n\n“This is on a whole new level, if Tillerson is really saying we would defend the innocent anywhere in the world,” Gordon added. “If that’s the new standard, we are going to be doing a lot of intervening.”\n\nRussia has denied the Syrian regime carried out the Khan Sheikhun chemical attack, which killed more than 80 people (including in strikes on hospitals after the attacks), and has denounced the US missile strike as illegal. Tillerson is due to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow. A Kremlin spokesman said there were no plans in Putin’s diary “right now” for a meeting, but US officials are expecting Putin to meet Tillerson on Wednesday. The two men had cordial relations when the Texan was in his previous job as head of the ExxonMobil oil company.\n\nAnother issue that hangs over Tillerson’s trip to Moscow is the question of Russia’s complicity in the chemical attack. Russian troops are stationed at their own compound at the Sharyat base and were there at the time Washington alleges Syrian aircraft took off on Tuesday for the attack on Khan Sheikhun.\n\nThe Associated Press quoted a senior US official as saying the US had concluded that Russia had prior knowledge of the Tuesday chemical attack on Khan Sheikhun. The official said a drone operated by Russians was flying over a hospital as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment. Hours after the drone left, a Russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons, the AP reported.\n\nCharles Lister, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute, said: “I’m told the US knows of Russia’s involvement in the CW [chemical weapons] attack and hopes to use this as back-scenes leverage.”\n\nBut on Monday evening, at a snap off-the-record briefing at the White House, a senior administration official rejected the claim, insisting that no such consensus about Russia’s foreknowledge exists in the intelligence community.\n\n\n\nA joint command centre made up of the forces of Russia, Iran and militias supporting the Syrian regime warned the US missile strike had crossed “red lines” and it would respond to any new aggression and increase its support for its ally.\n\n“What America waged in an aggression on Syria is a crossing of red lines. From now on we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is, and America knows our ability to respond well,” the centre said in a statement published by the group on the media outlet Ilam al Harbi (War Media).\n\nThe supreme leader of Iran, which provides substantial ground support to the Assad regime, has also warned the US that its intervention would prove to be a mistake for Trump.\n\nWhat is the G7? The Group of 7, known as the G7, is a forum of countries representing about half the world's economic output. It currently consists of the UK, the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The EU is also represented. Leaders from the group meet regularly to discuss the global economy, international security and the environment. In 2014, Russia was expelled from the group, then called the G8, over the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea. The G7 meeting in Italy provided an opportunity to discuss options for putting pressure on Assad and his main foreign backer, Russia. By coordinating efforts, the G7 hoped for a greater chance of success in shifting Moscow's strategic calculus on Syria.\n\n\n\n“This is their last in a series of strategic errors ... which will definitely have backlash against their own interests,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told senior commanders of the Iranian armed forces on Sunday.\n\nThe most immediate issue on the agenda of Tillerson’s talks with Lavrov will be the future of a hotline between the US and Russian militaries, intended to avoid collisions between their warplanes over Syria. Moscow announced it had been suspended in reaction to the US Tomahawk strike. But on Monday, three days after the strike, Pentagon officials would not say if Russia had actually used the channel to guard against any accidental midair confrontation, and declined all comment on the subject.\n\nStatistics released by the US military show airstrikes in Syria reducing slightly in volume on Friday, the day after the strike, to seven strikes, the lowest coalition total in Syria in April. But the strike tempo picked up over the weekend, to a typical recent volume of 16 strikes on Saturday and 18 on Sunday against Isis targets in eastern Syria.\n\nAdditional reporting by Saeed Kamali Dehghan","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/syria-top-of-agenda-as-g7-foreign-ministers-meet-in-italy","1491796800.0"
"Little Rock Nine: the day young students shattered racial segregation\nMinnijean Brown Trickey didn’t intend to make a political statement when she set off with two friends for her first day in high school. She was, after all, only 15. “I mean, part of growing up in a segregated society is that it’s a little sort of enclave and you know everybody,” says Trickey, who is African American. “So, I was thinking: ‘Wow! I can meet some other kids.’”\n\nCentral high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, seemed to have a lot going for it. “The black school was kind of far away and there was no bus,” she says. “We went to get new shoes and we were really trying to decide what to wear. So we were very teenage-esque about it, just totally naive.”\n\nThe impact of affirmative action at the University of California in one graphic Read more\n\nIt was September 1957, the Jim Crow era of racial segregation, and nine black pupils little guessed they were about to plant a milestone in the struggle for civil rights to follow those of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old lynched in Mississippi in 1955, and Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Alabama later the same year.\n\nBrown v Board of Education, the landmark 1954 supreme court ruling that segregated schools were unconstitutional, should have meant she and fellow pupils could take their places at Central High. But Governor Orval Faubus of Arkansas, in the deep south, remained defiant and used the national guard to block their enrollment. The African American children were left in limbo for three weeks.\n\nOn the first day of term, the national guard were there to stop the nine entering Central High, where all 1,900 attendees were white. Three weeks later, on 25 September, the group braved a hostile white crowd, climbed the school steps and were escorted to class by US army troops. They became known and revered as the Little Rock Nine.\n\nEight of the nine are still living and will return to Little Rock on Monday to mark the 60th anniversary of the US’s first major battle over school segregation. A day later, several will be in Washington to speak at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. It will be a moment to reflect on how far the US has come in unravelling educational apartheid – and whether, in recent years, progress has stalled or even reversed.\n\nThe share of “intensely segregated” black schools has trebled over the past 25 years, according to research by the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which warns of a “resegregation” taking hold. Trickey, who turned 76 earlier this month, asks bleakly: “What kind of country doesn’t see education for all children to be the primary value? I think the US has two values: segregation, which they do so well, and violence.”\n\nSpeaking by phone from her longtime home in Canada, she can still remember vividly the combination of segregation and violence that left her “whole body shaking with fear and shock” as a teenager six decades ago.\n\nOn 23 September 1957, the group did get into the building with police protection. But an angry mob of more than a thousand white people had gathered in front of the school, chanting racist abuse such as “Go back to Africa”.\n\n“I really think that we were afraid to look at the mob; at least I was,” says Trickey. “So we just heard it and it was like a sports event, that sound, the roar, but it was a roar of hatred, and just thinking about it makes me shake.”\n\nShe says of her young self: “I’m nobody. I’ve never been hated. I’ve been loved all my life. I’m beautiful. I’m smart. I just can’t believe this. So I kind of describe it as having my heart broken. Of course, you know as an ‘American’ even living in a segregated society you do all the anthems and the pledges and you’re hiding under the desk from the Russians, and so brainwashing works well. So the heartbreak was: ‘I’m supposed to be living in a democracy. What? These people hate me. They don’t know me. They want to kill me.’”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Little Rock Nine form a study group after being prevented from entering Little Rock’s Central high school. Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nThe mob started a riot and police decided to remove the students for their own safety. “At about 10am they said: ‘You’ve got to come down to the office,’ and we went down into the basement. They put us in these cars and the cops driving the cars were shaking. They had the guns and sticks and they were scared. ‘Oh wow, this is scary.’ Some of us were told to keep our heads down.\n\n“Melba Pattillo Beals [another of the nine] says she overheard a person saying: ‘Once you drive, do not stop.’ So they quickly drove us out from the side, then later we watched TV and could see the mob was going to go inside.”\n\nThe crisis was cause for Washington to intervene. President Dwight Eisenhower sent in 1,200 paratroopers from the 101st airborne division. The soldiers escorted the students single file into the school for their first full day of classes and dispersed the demonstrators. The US’s racial shame had been exposed, shown on TV and reported in newspapers around the world. “Negroes escorted into school,” reported the Manchester Guardian, noting that two white protesters clashed with the soldiers and were injured.\n\nFrom the archive: how the Guardian reported the Little Rock civil rights showdown in 1957 Read more\n\nRichard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at progressive thinktank Century Foundation, says he regards it as a turning point for the country: “We were accustomed to having schools segregated by race. We in essence had a system of apartheid in our schools that had been widely accepted in the south. The Little Rock Nine were an incredibly courageous group of African Americans that stood up and said this system of apartheid, which had been struck down by a supreme court decision, could not stand.\n\nBut although 25 September is the date people remember, troops remained at Central high school for the rest the school year and the Little Rock Nine ran the gauntlet of hatred every day. They were taunted, assaulted and spat upon by their white counterparts; a straw effigy of a black person was hung from a tree. They were kept apart in different classes so they could not vouch for each other’s claims.\n\n“It’s the going back: that’s the bravery, that’s the courage,” Trickey says. “It’s the going home and saying: ‘Wow, they’re not stopping me, I’ll go back no matter what.’ There is no courage at the outset: the courage kicks in later.”\n\nTrickey was first suspended, and then expelled, for retaliating against tormentors who went unpunished. She was invited to New York to live in the home of Kenneth and Mamie Clark, social psychologists whose groundbreaking work showed the negative impact of segregation on African American children, and finished her secondary education. She eventually became an activist, environmentalist and social worker with a spell in the Bill Clinton administration.\n\nBeals became a journalist and author and lives in San Francisco; Carlotta Walls LaNier, the youngest of the nine, became a property broker in Denver; Elizabeth Eckford served in the army, became a probation officer and lives in Little Rock; Ernest Green served in the Jimmy Carter administration and worked for Lehman Brothers in Washington DC; Gloria Ray Karlmark worked as an aerospace research technician and lives in the Netherlands and Sweden; Terrence Roberts became a psychologist and management executive in Pasadena, California; Thelma Mothershed Wair had a career as a teacher and worked with young offenders and the homeless, then moved back to Little Rock; Jefferson Thomas fought in Vietnam, became an accounting clerk with the defence department and died in Columbus, Ohio, from pancreatic cancer in 2010.\n\nThe nine were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by Clinton in 1999 and have met for reunions, particularly on anniversaries. “We’re on conference calls and we’re giggling and we say about ourselves that, when we get together, we become teenagers again,” says Trickey.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters outside Central high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, 1959. Photograph: Granger/REX/Shutterstock\n\nA cause for optimism – and caution\n\nBut the legacy of Little Rock is non-linear, and cause for both optimism and caution. While significant strides were made towards desegregation in the 70s and 80s, a series of decisions by the supreme court between 1991 and 2007 authorized the termination of cross-district bussing, local court supervision of desegregation plans and limited use of race-based admissions. An interplay of race, class and geography is at work, including the middle class’s ability to self-replicate by buying homes near the best-funded schools.\n\nThe Civil Rights Project at UCLA reported last year a “striking rise” in double segregation by race and poverty for African American and Latino students concentrated in schools that “rarely attain the successful outcomes typical of middle-class schools with largely white and Asian student populations”. The year 1988 was the “high point” of desegregation for black students in terms of the share of students in majority white schools, it found, but since then the proportion of “intensely segregated nonwhite schools” (those with 10% or less white students) rose from 5.7% to 18.6% of all public schools. There is little sign Donald Trump and his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, regard this as a priority.\n\nSpeaking from the steps of Central high school for the 40th anniversary in 1997, Clinton warned: “Segregation is no longer the law, but too often separation is still the rule. Today, children of every race walk through the same door, but then they often walk down different halls. Not only in this school, but across America, they sit in different classrooms, they eat at different tables. They even sit in different parts of the bleachers at the football game.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Little Rock Nine: Thelma Mothershed Wair, Minnijean Brown Trickey, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford and Melba Pattillo Beals on the steps of Little Rock’s Central High with Bill Clinton. Photograph: Jeff Mitchell US/Reuters\n\nThe Little Rock Nine could be forgiven a sense of frustration at such uneven progress. “It’s all institutional and it’s all centuries old,” says Trickey, “so we’re seeing the result of policies that have been made over time. It has become more visible because the people who are running the country now are profoundly intentionally ignorant.”\n\nAfter the first black US president was succeeded by a man supported by white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, Trickey sees history coming full circle. “People went into their basements and pulled out the old signs that they used in Little Rock, in Selma, across the country. “Integration is a sin”, “Integration is an abomination against God”, “Integration is communism”. They’re using the same ones they used 60 years ago. But there will be young people like the Little Rock Nine who are gonna keep going; I’m trying to train as many of them as I can.”\n\nThe US capital offers one glimpse of the wider trends. New research by the Albert Shanker Institute shows that, in Washington DC, 86.1% of the typical black student’s peers are also black, and more than half the private school student population is white compared with less than 10% of public school.\n\nDC Scholars public charter school, which opened in 2012, is just five miles from the dome of the US Capitol and the most powerful legislative body in the world. The school’s bright, colourful walls include photos of the “scholar of the month!”, a table showing percentages of students who improved their maths and reading scores and a series of university pennants including Harvard and Yale. There are 512 pupils, of whom 31% have disabilities – for example, learning disorders or ADHD – which is treble the national average. The student body is 100% African American.\n\nTanesha Dixon, principal of the middle school, explains this as being largely down to geography: “We are east of the river. This is a very black community. We have middle-class children and lower-class children; not every student is a ‘latchkey kid’ or from a broken home. We have a diversity because the black experience is not a monolithic experience.”\n\nShe adds: “I’m not even thinking of the colour of their skin; I’m thinking of the quality of the education they’re getting. The fact we’ve been able to provide a high quality of education east of the river every day is one of the reasons I keep coming to work.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Little Rock Nine member Minnijean Brown-Trickey. Photograph: Gareth Patterson/AP\n\nAsked how the Little Rock Nine would react if they visited, Dixon says: “I would hope they would be shocked in a very good way, amazed at the calibre of discussion that schools are having. I would put my school against any in the city to read, write and do arithmetic. It’s kind of cool to be a nerd here. Kids of colour are going to a school where they have access to great teachers and great resources.”\n\nThe debates remain complex, progress uneven, the answers elusive. Justin Reid, director of African American programmes at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, says: “Little Rock was definitely a flashpoint in the civil rights movement and inspired activists, but it also galvanised many southern states in how they attacked integration efforts. They did it in a quiet, subversive way; they didn’t want the media attention that was attracted in Little Rock. You saw legislators think carefully: how can we block integration?”\n\nHe adds: “I think the Little Rock Nine would have to be disappointed. We’re regressing. The peak time for integration was the 70s and 80s. We now live in a society where there is more segregation than ever before.”\n\nSpeaking by phone from Little Rock, Ernest Green, now 75, admits he is “disappointed” but insists he is also “pleased” by the evolution of the past 60 years.\n\n\n\nBetsy DeVos sparks ire by linking historically black colleges with 'school choice' Read more\n\n“The US is still segregated by housing and employment, which are the two pillars we still have to struggle with,” he says. “But I believe our experience will act as an inspiration to many young people. It may inspire some on the other side: there’s probably a crowd that wants to go back to slavery, but we won’t let them.\n\n“I survived a year of Orval Faubus, the Arkansas governor, in 1957. If we pace ourselves according to what Trump wants, obviously we’ll go backwards. The idea is to continue the fight and push for equity in this country.”\n\nGreen recalls a little-remembered line from Martin Luther King’s “I have a dream” speech in Washington in 1963, in which the civil rights leader argued that America had defaulted on its constitutional promise to citizens of colour, like a check that comes back marked “insufficient funds”.\n\nBut King refused to believe the bank of justice is bankrupt.\n\n“Dr Martin Luther King said the US had given black people a bad check; we’re still waiting for the check to be honoured.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/24/little-rock-arkansas-school-segregation-racism","1506225600.0"
"Trump's 'America First' policy has isolated U.S. from world leaders\nBreaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nNews analysis\n\nLONDON — President Donald Trump hasn’t started a war. But he’s spent his first year in the White House at war, and his military has dropped a record number of bombs on the Middle East.\n\nUnlike many of his predecessors, Trump's vision for U.S. foreign policy is crystal clear and summed up in two words: 'America First.'\n\nActing on this, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and pulled out of a global climate agreement. But this has led to 'America Isolated.'\n\nTrump has positioned himself, at home and abroad, as the “disruptor in chief,” a political insurgent throwing stones at the establishment on behalf of the people who elected him. He relishes it.\n\nBut as a result, the U.S. is standing alone on more key global issues than ever before. And America's seductive sheen of 'soft power' — the ability to get what they want through attraction and persuasion — has been diminished.\n\nTrump has praised the presidents of global rivals Russia and China, while criticizing the leaders of America’s closest allies Britain and Germany. He has also sowed doubt about America’s commitment to its oldest alliances, such as NATO.\n\nIt’s too early to say whether Trump’s foreign policy has been a success or failure. However, several things are clear.\n\nMiddle East and Afghanistan\n\nIn one war, Trump can claim success. His airstrikes have helped to end the Islamic State group's rule in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIt’s too early to call it complete victory, but Trump’s — and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s — bombs spoke louder than Barack Obama’s words.\n\nThe terror group’s 'caliphate,' proclaimed in Iraq’s second-largest city Mosul and headquartered in the Syrian city of Raqqa, has collapsed.\n\nTeen members of the Syrian Democratic Forces joke with each other after the fall of ISIS in Raqqa, Syria, on Oct. 1. Erik De Castro / Reuters file\n\nHowever, the remaining ISIS fighters have scattered.\n\nThe 'blowback' against the U.S. and Europe may yet come, as those fighters refocus their campaigns and some return to the West.\n\nBut the defeat of ISIS is clear. It came at a cost. Trump dropped a record number of bombs on the Middle East — around 40,000 on Iraq and Syria.\n\nAs a result, civilian casualties under Trump reached an all-time high in Iraq and Syria, according to Airwars, which tracks international airstrikes against ISIS using official figures.\n\nAnger at American airstrikes and at the presence of thousands of U.S. troops — including 2,000 in Syria alone — may yet set back counterinsurgency efforts in the region.\n\nElsewhere in the Middle East, the Trump record is murkier.\n\nPerhaps no president — not even George W. Bush invading Iraq in 2003 — has lined up more nations against a single policy as Trump did when he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nFrom European allies to global rivals like China and Russia, from Iran to the Vatican, his move was denounced. It is hard to see what Trump gained the U.S. by doing it, easy to see how he delighted his base at home.\n\nA Palestinian protests against President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel during a rally near the West Bank city of Ramallah on Dec. 20. Goran Tomasevic / Reuters file\n\nThe “Middle East peace process” has made no obvious progress; it’s a phrase beloved of policymakers and journalists that cloaks a desert of failure and frustration.\n\nTrump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has been put in charge of it, with little to show so far. This, after Trump boasted that peace between Israelis and Palestinians “is something that I think is frankly, maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years.” Officials suggest there may be something to announce in early 2018.\n\nTrump has also been at war in Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen as he targets ISIS, al Qaeda and their affiliates.\n\nHe signaled a change in policy in Afghanistan, announcing 4,000 extra American troops to help the 11,000 already there. He also dropped nearly 4,000 bombs on the country, including the largest non-nuclear bomb ever detonated.\n\nIran\n\nTrump sent a signal to the region with his first trip outside America.\n\nHe chose not to hop over the border to Canada or Mexico, as every other recent president has done, but to instead visit Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt sent a message of solidarity to the Sunni Muslim world — but perhaps an even stronger one to Shiite Iran.\n\nIf Tehran sees one enemy greater than Washington, it’s Riyadh.\n\nAnd Trump has Iran in his sights. In his campaign Trump promised to support Israel, confront Iran and get out of other people’s wars in the Middle East.\n\nDespite his campaign promise to scrap the Iran nuclear deal — “the worst deal ever negotiated”— on Day One in office, he hasn’t yet done so.\n\nBut in October he decertified the nuclear deal, turning his back on a U.S. commitment without providing evidence that Iran was reneging on the deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the terms of the deal.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/analysis-trump-s-america-first-foreign-policy-isolates-u-s-n833046","None"
"One group loved Trump’s remarks about Charlottesville: White supremacists\nSpeaking from his resort in Bedminster, N.J., on Aug. 12, President Trump said, 'The hate and division must stop. And must stop now.' (The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump’s public remarks on the violence in Charlottesville have been criticized by many, including members of his own political party, for being insufficient and vague.\n\nBut Trump’s choice of words — and the silence that preceded them — are being cheered by at least a few groups of people: neo-Nazis and white nationalists.\n\nOn the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, updates about Saturday’s events unfolded quickly, as hundreds of mostly young, white men who had gathered in Charlottesville to stage a rally to “take America back” clashed with counterprotesters.\n\n“WE HAVE AN ARMY!” the website posted to a live blog shortly after 11 a.m., along with photos of people carrying Confederate flags and neo-Nazi paraphernalia. “THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A WAR!”\n\nShortly afterward, the “Unite the Right” rally planned for noon — intended to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in the city’s Emancipation Park — had been canceled as Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) declared a state of emergency.\n\nAround 1 p.m. Saturday, Trump finally broke his silence, tweeting that there was “no place for this kind of violence in America.”\n\nWe ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017\n\nAm in Bedminster for meetings & press conference on V.A. & all that we have done, and are doing, to make it better-but Charlottesville sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017\n\nTrump’s first tweet didn’t even mention Charlottesville and neither tweet denounced the ideology that had driven the white nationalists to rally in the first place. And they were so generalized that even self-proclaimed “alt-right” leader Richard Spencer, who was at the demonstrations Friday and Saturday, quoted one and wondered whether the president had just denounced antifascists instead of them.\n\nDid Trump just denounce antifa? https://t.co/jOgiw4pPzK — Richard ☝Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) August 12, 2017\n\nThe Daily Stormer live blog quoted Trump’s initial tweets with the commentary: “Trump is tweeting about us. I don’t think he understands who the haters were.”\n\nSoon, the chaos in Charlottesville escalated even further as a car plowed into a crowd, killing one person and injuring 19 others. Police later arrested 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., of Ohio, who was identified by a former teacher as being a longtime Nazi sympathizer.\n\nFrom his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Trump once again addressed the violence, this time by reading a prepared statement. Once again, however, the president did not mention white supremacists or white nationalists. In fact, he seemed to go out of his way to avoid placing blame.\n\n“The hate and division must stop. And must stop right now,” Trump said Saturday. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides. On many sides. It’s been going on for a long time in our country.”\n\nHe did not say which “sides” he was referring to, or whose hatred and bigotry he was condemning.\n\n[One dead as car strikes crowds amid protests of white nationalist gathering in Charlottesville; two police die in helicopter crash]\n\nLess than a half-hour after Trump’s live remarks, the Daily Stormer had declared the president’s words as a signal of tacit support for their side:\n\nTrump comments were good. He didn’t attack us. He just said the nation should come together. Nothing specific against us. He said that we need to study why people are so angry, and implied that there was hate … on both sides! So he implied the antifa are haters. There was virtually no counter-signaling of us at all. He said he loves us all.\n\nThe neo-Nazi live blog also noted that Trump had refused to respond when a reporter asked about white nationalists who supported him.\n\n“No condemnation at all,” the Daily Stormer wrote. “When asked to condemn, [Trump] just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him.”\n\nIt was far from the first time white supremacists had signaled their support for Trump. Earlier Saturday, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke replied to Trump, suggesting the president was attacking “White Americans being targeted for discriminated [sic].”\n\n“I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists,” Duke tweeted to Trump.\n\nSo, after decades of White Americans being targeted for discriminated & anti-White hatred, we come together as a people, and you attack us? https://t.co/Rkfs7O2Ykr — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) August 12, 2017\n\nI would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists. https://t.co/Rkfs7O2Ykr — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) August 12, 2017\n\nTrump has in the past had to be pushed to rebuke white supremacy and those in the movement who supported him, particularly when it came to Duke. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker blog found that Trump’s statements about Duke, spanning more than two decades, are often “reactive.” For example, when Bloomberg News’s John Heilemann asked Trump in 2015 whether he would repudiate Duke, Trump responded: “Sure, I would do that, if it made you feel better. I don’t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. Actually I don’t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all of the candidates.”\n\nAs The Post’s Jenna Johnson and John Wagner reported, Trump’s presidential campaign excited many white nationalists:\n\nThey rallied behind his promises to build a wall on the southern border, reduce the number of foreigners allowed into the country and pressure everyone in the country to speak English and say “Merry Christmas.” And they celebrated Trump selecting Stephen K. Bannon as his chief strategist, who formerly ran the right-wing Breitbart News and advocated for what he calls the “alt-right” movement.\n\nThe Daily Stormer wrapped up its coverage of Saturday’s violence in Charlottesville by attacking House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) for speaking out forcefully against white supremacists and neo-Nazis. It ended with nary a word about Trump — but an optimistic note to those who had protested in Charlottesville, and a word of warning to everyone else.\n\n“And to everyone, know this: we are now at war. And we are not going to back down. … We are going to go bigger than Charlottesville. We are going to go huge. We are going to take over the country. … We learned a lot today. And we are going to remember what we learned. This has only just begun.”\n\nKristine Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nCharlottesville victim: ‘She was there standing up for what was right’\n\nAlleged driver of car that plowed into Charlottesville crowd was a Nazi sympathizer, former teacher says\n\nPolice in Charlottesville criticized for slow response to violent demonstrations","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/08/13/one-group-loved-trumps-remarks-about-charlottesville-white-supremacists/","1502596800.0"
"What is National Coming Out Day?\nToday is National Coming Out Day, dedicated to raising awareness of civil rights for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community.\n\nLGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign says that National Coming Out Day is meant to help create an environment where living openly and honestly is possible.\n\n“Coming out is one of the most courageous acts any LGBTQ person makes, and on this National Coming Out Day that courage remains essential to our continued progress toward full equality,” said HRC President Chad Griffin in a press release today. “As LGBTQ people across the nation and around the world continue to come out, opposition to equality will continue to crumble. Sharing our stories is a key way each of us can fight back against attempts to turn back the clock on LGBTQ equality.”\n\nThe idea for the day was the culmination of four months of momentum where more than 100 activists were gathered in Manassas, Virginia near Washington D.C., according to the HRC, conceived by psychologist Richard Eicherg and activist Jean O’Leary on October 11, 1988. Their meeting followed the second march on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights on Oct. 11, 1987, in which half a million people participated and the AIDS Quilt was displayed.\n\nIn the 1980s, AIDS and HIV disproportionately affected the gay and lesbian communities in the U.S., but many felt the epidemic was not being researched because of discrimination against that community.\n\nAP\n\nA recent study sponsored by GLAAD, formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said that 20 percent of millennials identify as LGBTQ.

They define coming out as 'self-awareness of same-sex attractions; the telling of one or a few people about these attractions; widespread disclosure of same-sex attractions and identification with the lesbian, gay and bisexual community.'\n\nThe three stages of coming out, according to the HRC, are opening up to oneself, coming out and living openly.\n\nComing out can be a difficult time for many in the LGBTQ community, advocates say, and many organization offer counseling and support.\n\n“National Coming Out Day has become an important holiday for LGBTQ youth. Each year around this time we speak with a great deal of young people weighing whether or not to come out to their loved ones. As many folks who have done so can tell you, coming out is a deeply personal experience, and it’s different for everyone. We work with each individual caller who is seeking support on the issue to make sure that if they do feel ready to come out, they have a plan to do so safely. We help them explore friends and family who may possibly be a support system for them. We want to make sure that young people aren’t coming out just because they feel pressured to do so by a holiday, but are doing so because they themselves have made the choice best for them, ” Amit Paley of CEO and Executive Director of The Trevor Project told ABC News.\n\nThe Trevor Project, which provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ youth, has counselors to help LGBTQ community members come out.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/national-coming-day/story?id=50394160","None"
"'Serial masturbators' in Cook County custody rewarded with pizza for 30-day abstention: Lawsuit\nHundreds of women employed with the public defender's office in Cook County, Illinois have filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that the public defender and sheriff conspired in their refusal to stop the daily occurrence of sexual assaults by detainees.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges an ordeal suffered by female employees due to the detainees’ actions and a policy that rewarded alleged repeat abusers with pizza if they stopped -- a step that the suit says only increased the problem.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriff's Office said the pizza rewards program described in the lawsuit never took place.\n\nFemale public defenders and law clerks in the County lockup endure 'daily abuses' from detainees, including masturbation in their presence, 'verbal threats laden with explicit sexual violence, exposure of detainees' genitals, and physical attacks,' according to a press release by Chicago-based employment law firm Potter Bolaños LLC.\n\nThe incidents occur in holding areas in each of the courthouses in Cook County as well as the Cook County jail, according to court documents.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in the Northeastern District of Illinois, alleges that Cook County Public Defender Amy Campanelli and Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart refused to stop the alleged daily attacks. Campanelli and Dart are named in the lawsuit in both official and individual capacities, court documents show.\n\nThe women have been 'increasingly subjected' to the offensive incidents for at least two years, according to the lawsuit, which claims that Campanelli and Dart have been aware of the 'offensive and dangerous conduct by detainees' for that entire length of time but 'have knowingly permitted it to continue.'\n\nAlmost all women public defenders and law clerks have been subjected to masturbation or exposure incidents by male detainees, and some women have been subjected to multiple incidents by multiple detainees on the same day, court documents state.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking 'an injunction to end the abuse so that they can safely and effectively do their jobs,' the release states.\n\nChicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images, FILE\n\nIn a letter Campanelli sent to Dart in March, which was provided to ABC News by the plaintiff's attorneys, the public defender refers to the 'daily assaults' as a 'crisis' that affects the 'safety of the workplace' for women in the public defender's office due to their 'fear of being sexually or physically assaulted.'\n\nIn the letter, Campanelli wrote that an 'immediate solution is necessary,' but the lawsuit alleges that nothing was done in the months that followed to 'remedy the situation and stop the abuse,' according to the release.\n\n'Instead, Dart and Campanelli regularly rescinded measures that were effective in decreasing the harassment, including cuffing detainees, requiring detainees to wear jumpsuits in lockup, and assigning a sheriff to monitor lockup areas,' the release states.\n\nDart attempted to solve the problem by requiring detainees to wear 'special jumpsuits' to help prevent them from reaching their penises in early 2017, but the practice was discontinued after a group of detainees burned the jumpsuits using a microwave, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAround the same time Dart had also began to handcuff detainees while they were in the courthouse lockups, which resulted in 'significantly decreased instances of masturbation and exposure,' the lawsuit states. But, the practice was discontinued after Campanelli 'ordered it stopped immediately, without ensuring that another measure was in place...'\n\nIn May, Dart added additional officers to the lockup, which also 'significantly decreased' the incidents, but the extra officers were withdrawn a short time later due to a lack of funds, according to the lawsuit.\n\nG-Jun Yam/AP, FILE\n\nDart then instituted a program that rewarded 'serial masturbators' with pizza if they went 30 days without a sexual assault or masturbating incident, according to the lawsuit.\n\nSince detainees who had never exposed themselves were not eligible to receive pizza as a reward, the program had a reverse effect, leading to an 'increase in exposure incidents' since the detainees without prior incidents 'were now incentivized to commit indecent exposure and masturbation in order to qualify for a pizza reward,' court documents state.\n\nThe plaintiffs have also filed class-action lawsuits with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Those charges are currently being investigated, according to the release.\n\n'Some women suffer numerous incidents of exposure and/or masturbation in a single day even as male attorneys are not targeted for these incidents,' the release states.\n\nCharles Rex Arbogast/AP, FILE\n\nOf the more than 400 public defenders employed in Cook County, more than 60 percent are women, according to court documents. In a meeting on Oct. 18 with a group of public defenders, Campanelli allegedly told the female public defenders that there was nothing she could do to help them and that it was not her 'responsibility' to keep them 'safe in the lockup and jail,' according to the lawsuit.\n\nAttorneys Robin Potter and Nieves Bolaños said the case 'highlights the fact that sexual harassment and assault at work is grossly underreported across all industries in this county.'\n\n'Our clients work hard to ensure a level playing field for all people accused of crimes,' Potter and Bolaños said in a statement. 'They have a right to perform that important and already difficult job in an environment that is free from sexual assault.'\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Cook County Sheriff's Office Chief Policy Officer Cara Smith said the sheriff's office will continue to do all it can to 'address the despicable behavior' exhibited by the detainees.\n\n'We are hopeful the PD's office will work with us to find solutions to this problem, instead of impeding the proposed solutions we put forth,' Smith said. 'No woman or employee should have to endure sexual harassment in the workplace.'\n\nLester Finkle, chief of staff for the public defender's office, said it has been collaborating with the sheriff's office and the chief judge for the past two years 'to develop solutions to stop this behavior from occurring.\n\n'However, the Public Defender cannot support legislation or measures that significantly increase penalties for detainees who engage in this behavior or that subject detainees to inhumane practices,' Finkle said. 'The Public Defender’s paramount concern is preserving the safety and well-being of her staff, and she will continue working in good faith with other stakeholders to find a viable solution.'\n\nABC News' Jim Hill and Rachel Katz contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/serial-masturbators-cook-county-custody-rewarded-pizza-30/story?id=51024509","None"
"Scientists discover 91 volcanoes below Antarctic ice sheet\nThis is in addition to 47 already known about and eruption would melt more ice in region affected by climate change\n\nScientists have uncovered the largest volcanic region on Earth – two kilometres below the surface of the vast ice sheet that covers west Antarctica.\n\nThe project, by Edinburgh University researchers, has revealed almost 100 volcanoes – with the highest as tall as the Eiger, which stands at almost 4,000 metres in Switzerland.\n\nGeologists say this huge region is likely to dwarf that of east Africa’s volcanic ridge, currently rated the densest concentration of volcanoes in the world.\n\nAnd the activity of this range could have worrying consequences, they have warned. “If one of these volcanoes were to erupt it could further destabilise west Antarctica’s ice sheets,” said glacier expert Robert Bingham, one of the paper’s authors. “Anything that causes the melting of ice – which an eruption certainly would – is likely to speed up the flow of ice into the sea.\n\n“The big question is: how active are these volcanoes? That is something we need to determine as quickly as possible.”\n\nThe Edinburgh volcano survey, reported in the Geological Society’s special publications series, involved studying the underside of the west Antarctica ice sheet for hidden peaks of basalt rock similar to those produced by the region’s other volcanoes. Their tips actually lie above the ice and have been spotted by polar explorers over the past century.\n\nBut how many lie below the ice? This question was originally asked by the team’s youngest member, Max Van Wyk de Vries, an undergraduate at the university’s school of geosciences and a self-confessed volcano fanatic. He set up the project with the help of Bingham. Their study involved analysing measurements made by previous surveys, which involved the use of ice-penetrating radar, carried either by planes or land vehicles, to survey strips of the west Antarctic ice.\n\nThe results were then compared with satellite and database records and geological information from other aerial surveys. “Essentially, we were looking for evidence of volcanic cones sticking up into the ice,” Bingham said.\n\nAfter the team had collated the results, it reported a staggering 91 previously unknown volcanoes, adding to the 47 others that had been discovered over the previous century of exploring the region.\n\nThese newly discovered volcanoes range in height from 100 to 3,850 metres. All are covered in ice, which sometimes lies in layers that are more than 4km thick in the region. These active peaks are concentrated in a region known as the west Antarctic rift system, which stretches 3,500km from Antarctica’s Ross ice shelf to the Antarctic peninsula.\n\n“We were amazed,” Bingham said. “We had not expected to find anything like that number. We have almost trebled the number of volcanoes known to exist in west Antarctica. We also suspect there are even more on the bed of the sea that lies under the Ross ice shelf, so that I think it is very likely this region will turn out to be the densest region of volcanoes in the world, greater even than east Africa, where mounts Nyiragongo, Kilimanjaro, Longonot and all the other active volcanoes are concentrated.”\n\nThe discovery is particularly important because the activity of these volcanoes could have crucial implications for the rest of the planet. If one erupts, it could further destabilise some of the region’s ice sheets, which have already been affected by global warming. Meltwater outflows into the Antarctic ocean could trigger sea level rises. “We just don’t know about how active these volcanoes have been in the past,” Bingham said.\n\nHowever, he pointed to one alarming trend: “The most volcanism that is going in the world at present is in regions that have only recently lost their glacier covering – after the end of the last ice age. These places include Iceland and Alaska.\n\n“Theory suggests that this is occurring because, without ice sheets on top of them, there is a release of pressure on the regions’ volcanoes and they become more active.”\n\nAnd this could happen in west Antarctica, where significant warming in the region caused by climate change has begun to affect its ice sheets. If they are reduced significantly, this could release pressure on the volcanoes that lie below and lead to eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans.\n\n“It is something we will have to watch closely,” Bingham said.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/12/scientists-discover-91-volcanos-antarctica","1502510400.0"
"North Korea defends nuke program as sanctions tighten\nManila, Philippines (CNN) North Korea has accused the United States of 'trying to drive the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war' after the UN Security Council unanimously adopted new sanctions Saturday in response to Pyongyang's long-range ballistic missile tests last month.\n\nThe measures aim to make it harder for North Korea to make money across the globe. They target North Korea's primary exports -- including coal, iron and seafood -- and attempt to cut off its additional revenue streams by targeting some of its banks and joint ventures with foreign companies.\n\nThe forceful comments, made in a statement released via the country's permanent mission to the United Nations Monday, condemned the sanctions in the 'strongest terms' declaring the resolution a 'wanton infringement upon the sovereignty of the country.'\n\nSpeaking at the ASEAN Regional Forum on Monday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed the US for the current situation on the Korean Peninsula and said Pyongyang's 'possession of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles is a legitimate option for self-defence in the face of a clear and real nuclear threat posed by the US.'\n\n'We will, under no circumstances, put the nukes and ballistic rockets on the negotiating table,' Ri said, adding Pyongyang would 'teach the US a severe lesson' if it used military force against North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said the country's missile launches were a 'stern warning to the US,' and warned Washington against 'believing that its land is safe across the ocean.'\n\n'(North Korea) will make the US pay dearly for all the heinous crimes it commits against the state and people of this country,' KCNA said.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would be open to dialogue 'when the conditions are right.'\n\nThe foreign ministers of North and South Korea spoke in a rare but brief exchange between the two countries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke to his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-In, tweeting in praise of the sanctions\n\nChina says that the situation on the Korean Peninsula had reached a 'critical point of crisis,' but added that it was a 'turning point for negotiations.'\n\nJUST WATCHED Tracking North Korea's missile tests Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tracking North Korea's missile tests 02:13\n\nA stern message\n\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the new UN measures were a stern message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the international community is united in its commitment to see a Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.\n\n'We hope again that this ultimately will result in North Korea coming to a conclusion to choose a different pathway, and when the conditions are right that we can sit and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea so that they feel secure and prosper economically,' Tillerson said at a news conference in the Philippines capital, where he was attending a regional security meeting.\n\nWeapons experts say the two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), fired on July 4 and July 28, were theoretically capable of reaching the mainland United States. But they were both fired at a lofted angle, likely to avoid hitting land (both ICBMs landed in the waters off the coast of the Korean Peninsula.)\n\nPyongyang sees its weapons program as the key to preventing US-led attempts at regime change, and the July missile tests showed Pyongyang may have passed an important threshold in its quest to obtain the ability to hit the US with a nuclear warhead.\n\nSome analysts have expressed doubt, however, that sanctions can stop the North Korean missile and nuclear programs, due to the regime's ongoing commitment to its nuclear program -- which they believe would be the last thing that would see spending cuts -- and the rapid progress they've made in recent years. North Korea is governed by a military-first policy enshrined in its constitution\n\nAccording to a statement from Russia's foreign ministry, top diplomat Sergey Lavrov met with his North Korean counterpart at the forum.\n\n'Lavrov called on all parties involved to show the utmost restraint in order to avoid the implementation of negative power scenarios on the Korean Peninsula and immediately start searching for a political and diplomatic settlement through a comprehensive solution of the peninsula's problems, including its denuclearization,' the statement said.\n\nWhy North Korea wants nukes and missiles North Korea has long maintained it wants nuclear weapons and long-range missiles in order to deter the United States from attempting to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang looks at states like Iraq -- where former dictator Saddam Hussein was overthrown by the United States, and Libya -- the country's late leader, Moammar Gaddafi, gave up his nuclear ambitions for sanctions relief and aid, only to be toppled and killed after the US intervened in the country's civil unrest -- and believes that only being able to threaten the US homeland with a retaliatory nuclear strike can stop American military intervention.\n\n'Lacked sincerity'\n\nTillerson is one of 27 global diplomats in the Philippines capital for the forum. His counterparts from Seoul and Pyongyang also are in attendance and briefly spoke at a gala dinner Sunday night.\n\nThe short conversation between South Korea's Kang Kyung-wha and North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho, though unlikely to lead to a diplomatic breakthrough, represents the first known high-level encounter between the two Koreas since South Korea President Moon Jae-in took office in May.\n\nKang told CNN the meeting was 'unplanned' and only lasted a 'couple of minutes.'\n\n'This regional forum is one of the few chances the North Koreans and South Koreans have to interact,' said Jean Lee, a global fellow for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the former Pyongyang bureau chief for the Associated Press.\n\nBut according to South Korean news agency Yonhap , citing an unnamed government source, Ri told Kang during their meeting Sunday that South Korea's offer of talks 'lacked sincerity.'\n\nMoon has long been a proponent of greater dialogue with Pyongyang in order to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nSunshine Policy Foreign policy of South Korea from 1998 to 2008\n\nPolicy of engagement with North Korea on economic and political issues\n\nTwo South Korean Presidents traveled to Pyongyang\n\nEarned South Korean President Kim Dae-jung a Nobel Peace Prize\n\nFewer North Korean nuclear and missile tests during this period\n\nUltimately failed to stop North Korean nuclear program\n\nAs an aide to President Roh Moo-hyun, Moon helped craft the so-called 'Sunshine Policy,' which called for an increase of engagement in the political and economic spheres.\n\n'Ultimately, President Moon Jae-in is a strong believer on dialogue and wants to get things on a different track with North Korea,' said John Delury, an associate professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of international Studies in Seoul.\n\nSouth Korea's former foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, also talked briefly with Ri at the same forum a year ago.\n\nTillerson: Stop missile launches\n\nThe White House said that Trump and Moon spoke on Sunday Washington time about the sanctions and 'affirmed that North Korea poses a grave and growing direct threat to the United States, South Korea, and Japan, as well as to most countries around the world.'\n\nJust completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017\n\nWhen asked how long Pyongyang would need to stop launching missiles for -- or if they would need to start dismantling their nuclear weapons program before talks -- Tillerson said 'we'll know it when we see it.'\n\n'The best signal that North Korea could give us that they're prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches. We've not had an extended period of time where they have not taken some type of provocative action by launching ballistic missiles,' Tillerson said.\n\n'This isn't about a specific number of days or weeks. This is really about the spirit of these talks and when they can demonstrate they're ready to sit with the spirit of finding a way forward in these talks by no longer conducting these missile tests,' Tillerson said.\n\n'It is all about how we see their attitude toward approaching a dialogue with us.'\n\nJUST WATCHED Nikki Haley: Sanctions are a gut punch to N.

Imposing fresh sanctions is aimed at bringing the conundrum back to the negotiation table,' China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.\n\nASEAN foreign ministers also issued a joint statement condemning the missile tests and calling for 'the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'","https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/06/asia/north-korea-asean/index.html","1501992000.0"
"Texas church shooter escaped mental health facility in 2012\nThe man who shot and killed 26 people in a Texas church Sunday was checked into and escaped from a mental health facility in New Mexico in 2012, according to a police report obtained by CBS News.\n\nDevin Kelley was sent to the Peak Behavioral Health Services Center in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, but escaped on June 13, 2012, fleeing to El Paso, Texas, according to the report. His stay at the facility came after multiple incidents between June 2011 and April 2012 in which he beat his wife and stepson, who suffered a fractured skull in one incident.\n\nIt is not clear if those attacks were why he was checked into the facility, but Kelley was already facing military charges at the time of his escape.\n\nThe El Paso police report warned that Kelley 'was a danger to himself and others as he had already been caught sneaking firearms' onto the base, where he 'was attempting to carry out death threats that (he) had made on his military chain of command.'\n\nEl Paso police arrested Kelley without incident at a bus stop and turned him over to New Mexico police. The report notes he did not make any threatening statements during his arrest.\n\nKelley was sentenced about five months later, on November 7, 2012 for the assaults, and was ordered to serve a year in confinement. In 2014, Kelley received a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force, which was supposed to notify the FBI of his domestic violence conviction. Kelley should have been barred from buying the weapons used in Sunday's shooting, according to Don Christensen, who at the time was the Air Force's top prosecutor.\n\nThe Air Force acknowledged Monday that it failed to flag Kelley as banned from buying firearms. The Air Force said it has launched a review of how the service handled Kelley's criminal records.\n\nTexas authorities say Kelley did not have a license to carry firearms. However, Kelley purchased four weapons in total during the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Two were bought in Colorado and two in Texas, ATF officials said. Three weapons were recovered at the scene of the shooting -- a Ruger AR-556 rifle found at the church, and two handguns, a Glock 9mm and a Ruger 22, found in his car, according to Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the ATF Houston.\n\nAcademy Sports, a Texas store where Kelley bought two weapons, confirmed in a statement to CBS News Monday that Kelley's purchases were approved by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Peak Behavioral Health said it would not confirm whether Kelley was a patient at the facility, citing federal and state law, as well as the company's policies.\n\n'Our hearts go out to the victims of this horrible act and their families and friends, and like everyone else in Texas, we are doing everything we can to help the community in recovering and healing from this tragedy,' the company said.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-church-shooter-devin-kelley-escaped-mental-health-facility-after-attacking-wife-stepson/","None"

Hamre worked as a Washington Transportation Department civil engineer until he retired a few years ago, said Lloyd Flem, executive director All Aboard Washington, according to the AP.\n\nTopper wrote on Facebook, 'My uncle Jim will be missed by so many. We are all very heart broken.'\n\nThe third victim was Benjamin Christian Gran, according to the Pierce County Medical Examiner.\n\nStephen Brashear/Getty Images\n\nElaine Thompson/AP\n\nHere's what we know about the deadly train crash:\n\n-The train was making its inaugural ride on the route from Seattle to Portland, Oregon. The track had recently been upgraded from a freight line to allow for passenger trains.\n\n-The train's emergency brake was automatically activated as the accident occurred and was not initiated by the conductor, said NTSB Vice Chairman Bella Dinh-Zarr in a press conference Tuesday evening.\n\n-An extra conductor was in the cab at the time of the crash to familiarize him or herself with the new route, Dinh-Zarr said. In addition to the conductor who was driving the train, a third conductor was in the passenger section, collecting tickets and doing other conductor duties, she said.\n\n-Testing on the new route started in January, and crews began operating non-revenue trains down the tracks for two weeks prior to Monday's launch and subsequent accident, Dinh-Zarr said. The engineer who was driving on Monday had been down the new route as part of his qualification to be able to drive, but the NTSB does not have any further details such as how many times the conductor had been through the new route, Dinh-Zarr said.\n\n-The train was not equipped with positive train control, an advanced system designed to automatically stop a train to prevent 'train-to-train' collisions, prevent an over-speed accident by slowing the train down or actually stopping the train. PTC had not been installed because a deadline requiring all trains to install it by the end of 2015 had been extended by Congress to the end of 2018, Dinh-Zarr said. A system of PTC had been installed but was not yet functional, she added.\n\n-Although the train was equipped with centralized traffic control, a form of railroad signaling that allows for dispatching the train's direction, it cannot enforce train speeds, Dinh-Zarr said.\n\n-The train was carrying over 80 passengers and crew. The crew, all of whom had been hospitalized, have not been interviewed yet, Dinh-Zarr said.\n\n-One passenger on the train, who was not seriously injured, said he heard a 'creaking' sound before the crash and was “catapulted” forward on impact. “The train started to wobble for a moment,' Chris Karnes told ABC News, 'And then we were catapulted at the seats in front of us. And the next thing that we knew, our car had crumpled at a portion at the top and we were down an embankment.' Karnes said his train car “came to rest on a hill -- there was water and a ton of dust flew up into the air.”\n\n-After the train derailed, several drivers were injured on the road below, but no one on the roadway was killed.\n\nElaine Thompson/AP\n\nRachel La Corte/AP\n\n-The cause of the crash is not clear.\n\n-The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the train was traveling 80 mph in a 30-mph zone, according to the black box recovered from the accident. Investigators have yet to interview the crew and engineer in the accident, and were unsure why the train was going so fast. Today is NTSB investigators' first full day on the scene, and they are being led by Ted Turpin, a veteran investigator who led the review of the 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia which killed eight people. The investigation is expected to last seven to 10 days.\n\nKOMO\n\n-Positive train control (PTC), which can automatically slow trains in order to avoid danger, was not in use on the tracks where the accident occurred. Though track owner Sound Transit said the feature was installed, it was apparently not activated. NTSB board member Bella Dinh-Zarr said it would investigate why beginning today. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said at a news conference today, 'There are a thousand unanswered questions,' including if the speed control could have made a difference.\n\n-Inslee -- who declared a state of emergency Monday -- said today, 'We have confidence that we will get to the bottom of what caused this horrific tragedy,' adding, 'we will fix anything' necessary to prevent future tragedies.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/county-transit-employee-killed-amtrak-train-derailment-washington/story?id=51878888","None"
"Michelle Carter sentenced to 2.5 years for texting suicide case\nMichelle Carter, who as a teenager sent texts urging her then-boyfriend to commit suicide, was sentenced today to 2.5 years in the Bristol County House of Correction for involuntary manslaughter, with 15 months to be served and the rest suspended, followed by five years of probation.\n\nIn announcing Carter's sentencing, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that she could stay free pending appeals.\n\nConrad Roy III was 18 when he died in July 2014 of carbon monoxide poisoning after locking himself in his truck in Massachusetts.\n\nCarter, now 20, who was Roy's girlfriend at the time of his death, went on trial this year, and the prosecution argued that Carter, then 17, was reckless and caused his death by telling Roy to get back in the car even though they say he didn’t want to die.\n\n'I could’ve stopped him,' Carter texted a classmate two months after Roy's death, according to testimony. Carter texted that she and Roy were on the phone the day of his suicide when Roy 'got out of the car ... he was scared.' Carter texted that she 'told him to get back in.'\n\nThe defense claimed that Carter had previously tried to talk Roy out of harming himself, pointing to one conversation where Roy told Carter he regretted dragging her into his plans to kill himself.\n\nEarlier today, the prosecution asked Moniz to sentence Carter to seven to 12 years in prison.\n\n'She ended his life to better her own,' the prosecution said, adding that Carter has not accepted responsibility for her actions.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier today the defense asked for five years of supervised probation with conditions including mental health treatment and no contact with the Roy family. Her defense attorney added that Carter regrets what happened and stressed that the sentence should be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\nABC News\n\nConrad Roy's sister, Camden Roy, gave a statement in court today ahead of the sentencing, calling her brother the best friend and role model 'any little sister could ask for.'\n\nConrad Roy's father, Conrad Roy Jr., said in court before sentencing, 'I cannot being to describe the despair I feel over the loss of my son. ... I am heartbroken, our family is heartbroken. My son was my best friend.'\n\nHe called his son sensitive, loving, compassionate and an excellent older brother who was 'adored' by his sisters.\n\n'How could Michelle Carter behave so viciously?' he said. 'Where was her humanity?'\n\nABC News\n\nHe said the last words he said to his son were 'I love you.'\n\n'I miss him every moment of every day,' Conrad Roy Jr. said.\n\nLynn Roy, Conrad Roy's mother, said in court before sentencing, 'I still cannot come to terms that another person who knew and described how much they loved my son would want to inflict so much pain' on Conrad Roy's family. 'He is the most amazing human being and would have had a bright future.\n\nMatt West/The Boston Herald via AP\n\n'This does not stop after a trial. I pray that his death will save lives some day,' she added.\n\nIn June, Moniz found Carter guilty of involuntary manslaughter, describing her behavior as 'reckless.' Involuntary manslaughter is defined as an unintentional killing resulting from recklessness or criminal negligence.\n\nGlenn C.Silva/Fairhaven Neighborhood News via AP Photo\n\nWhile announcing the verdict, Moniz said that Carter instructed Conrad Roy 'to get back into the truck well knowing of all of the feelings he [had] exchanged with her, his ambiguities, his fears, his concerns.'\n\n'This court finds that instructing Mr. Roy to get back in the truck constituted wanton and reckless conduct,' Moniz said.\n\nGlenn C.Silva/Fairhaven Neighborhood News via AP Photo\n\nThe judge also noted that Carter admitted in texts that she took no action; she knew the location of the truck and did not notify Conrad Roy's mother or sisters.\n\nCarter was charged as a youthful offender, which means that even though she was a minor at the time of the incident, she was charged as an adult. The maximum possible sentence was 20 years.\n\nConrad Roy's aunt Kim Bozzi told ABC News' '20/20' ahead of the sentencing, 'I don't think that she helped him kill himself. ... I think she forced him to kill himself. I think she was responsible for his death.'\n\nKim Bozzi said when she read the text about Carter telling Conrad Roy to get back in the truck, 'My heart broke because, unfortunately, he did.'\n\nBozzi said the most 'unbelievable' part of Carter's actions was 'how she acted after the fact. She was there, sitting on the phone, talking to him while he was taking his last breath.'\n\n'Then she texted my niece a couple hours later, 'Hey, do you know where your brother is?' Then she texted his mom the next day, 'Oh, hey, have you heard from Conrad?' Knowing all along,' she said.\n\nCarter also organized a fundraiser for Conrad Roy. 'All of his family showed up. Making all kinds of Facebook messages, tweets, talking about how he's her angel and she misses him, and she wants to be this advocate for suicide prevention,' Bozzi said. 'That, to me, was really where it got, we're not dealing with a normal human being. ... I think she just has a damaged moral core.'\n\nBozzi said she wants people to know that her nephew 'wasn't a troubled young teen, that he wasn't suicidal. ... He did struggle. He did have depression, he did have social anxiety and a lot of people do. A lot of boys do. A lot of people don't like to admit it when you have that, because you think it's a sign of weakness, so you don't like to share it. But it's OK.\n\n'Mental illness needs to be further researched and treated,' she said. 'As far as violence against men, I think is something that gets swept under the rug. I think women bully just as much.'\n\nBozzi said she went to court every day of Carter's trial for her nephew.\n\n'There's nothing else I can do for him,' she said. 'I know that I know how much he loved his mom and his sisters, and he's protective of them. I just try to watch over him like I know he'd want me to.\n\n'I think the world gained an angel. I think that hearing his story and getting to know who he was, I think he's in his absence just making a huge impact on people's lives,' she added. 'If it can help a couple people then he's happy. I can see him smiling.'\n\nABC News' Doug Lantz and Joseph Diaz contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/michelle-carter-set-sentenced-texting-suicide-case/story?id=48947807","None"

TransCanada crews detected a drop in pressure at about 6 a.m. CT Thursday morning and shut down the pipeline, which runs from Hardesty, Alberta, to Cushing, Okla., and Wood River/Patoka, Ill.\n\nAmherst is about 200 miles north of Sioux Falls, S.D., and about 25 miles from the state's border with North Dakota.\n\nThe conduit is not the controversial and long-delayed Keystone XL Pipeline that TransCanada is still shepherding through the approval process.\n\nBut as NPR's Jeff Brady reports, the spill comes at a sensitive time for TransCanada.\n\n'Regulators in the neighboring state of Nebraska are expected to announce a decision on the company's proposed Keystone XL pipeline next week. The project and its route through Nebraska have been controversial. Some landowners are concerned about how an oil spill might harm their property and water supplies.'\n\nThe spill does nothing to enhance prospects for the XL Pipeline, which critics argue should not be allowed to operate.\n\n'TransCanada cannot be trusted,' said Jane Kleeb, head of the Nebraska Democratic Party and a longtime activist opposed to Keystone XL, as quoted by the Washington Post.\n\n'I have full confidence that the Nebraska Public Service Commission is going to side with Nebraskans, not a foreign oil company,' she added.\n\nBrian Walsh, an environmental scientist manager at the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, said the company was aware of the spill at about 5:30 a.m. CT. But his agency wasn't alerted until about 10:30 a.m. CT.\n\n'There is a time lag there and I expect that that will be some of the questions we need to answer over the coming months,' he told Jeff.\n\nIn its statement, TransCanada said, 'The section of pipe along a right-of-way approximately 35 miles (56 kilometres) south of the Ludden pump station in Marshall County, South Dakota was completely isolated with 15 minutes and emergency procedures were activated.'\n\nThe spill occurred about 3 miles southeast of Amherst on private land, which Walsh described as a 'flat, grassy area for grazing.'

"Gulf plunged into diplomatic crisis as countries cut ties with Qatar\nQatari diplomats ejected and land, air and sea traffic routes cut off in row over terror and regional stability\n\nThe Gulf has been hit by its biggest diplomatic crisis in years after Arab nations including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region with its support for Islamist groups.\n\n\n\nThe countries said they would halt all land, air and sea traffic with Qatar, eject its diplomats and order Qatari citizens to leave the Gulf states within 14 days. Shoppers in the Qatari capital, Doha, meanwhile packed supermarkets amid fears the country, which relies on imports from its neighbours, would face food shortages after Saudi Arabia closed its sole land border.\n\nSocial media reports from Doha showed supermarket shelves empty as nervous consumers began to worry that stocks of food and water would run out. As much as 40% of Qatar’s food comes over the Saudi border.\n\nThe small but very wealthy nation, the richest in the world per capita, was also expelled from a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.\n\n\n\nWhat is Qatar's position in the Middle East? Qatar occupies a tiny headland on the Arabian peninsula, with a single land border with Saudi Arabia and across the sea from Iran. The former British protectorate gained its independence in 1971 and has since been ruled by the al-Thani family. With the highest per capita income in the world, the tiny monarchy has grown fabulously wealthy on the back of massive oil and natural gas reserves. Tensions with its Gulf Arab neighbours have grown in recent years over support for Islamist movements that emerged from the Arab Spring. It now finds itself isolated and backed into a corner.\n\nThe coordinated move dramatically escalates a dispute over Qatar’s support of Islamist movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood, and its perceived tolerance of Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival, Iran. The dispute is the worst to hit the Gulf since the formation of the Gulf Co-operation Council in 1981.\n\nQatar’s foreign affairs ministry said the measures were unjustified and based on false claims and assumptions. As the Qatari stock market tumbled and oil prices rose, it accused its fellow Gulf states of violating its sovereignty.\n\n“The state of Qatar has been subjected to a campaign of lies that have reached the point of complete fabrication,” a statement said. “It reveals a hidden plan to undermine the state of Qatar.”\n\nSaudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut diplomatic ties owing to Qatar’s “embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region”, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Islamic State and groups supported by Iran in Saudi Arabia’s restive eastern province of Qatif.\n\n\n\nEgypt’s foreign ministry accused Qatar of taking an “antagonist approach” towards the country and said “all attempts to stop it from supporting terrorist groups failed”. It gave the Qatari ambassador 48 hours to leave Egypt, and ordered its own chargé d’affaires in Qatar to return to Cairo within 48 hours.\n\n\n\nThe tiny island nation of Bahrain blamed its decision on Qatar’s “media incitement, support for armed terrorist activities, and funding linked to Iranian groups to carry out sabotage and spreading chaos in Bahrain”.\n\nIn a sign of Qatar’s growing isolation, Yemen’s internationally backed government – which no longer holds its capital and large portions of the country – joined the move to break relations, as did the Maldives and the government based in eastern Libya\n\nThere effect on air travel in the region was immediate. Qatar Airways, one of the region’s major long-haul carriers, said it was suspending all flights to Saudi Arabia. Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier, said it would suspend flights to Qatar “until further notice”. Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, announced it would suspend Qatar flights starting on Tuesday, and Dubai-based budget carrier flydubai said it would suspend flights to and from Doha from Tuesday.\n\n\n\nEgypt announced its airspace will be closed to all Qatari airplanes from Tuesday.\n\nMonday’s diplomatic moves came two weeks after four Arab countries blocked Qatar-based media over the appearance of comments attributed to the Qatari emir that praised Iran. Qatar said hackers had taken over the website of its state-run news agency and faked the comments.\n\nSaudi Arabia's power play leaves Qatar with little room to manoeuvre Read more\n\nA senior Iranian official said the decision to sever ties with Qatar would not help end the crisis in the Middle East. Hamid Aboutalebi, deputy chief of staff for Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, tweeted: “The era of cutting diplomatic ties and closing borders is over … it is not a way to resolve crisis. These countries have no other option but to start regional dialogue.”\n\nThe US military said it had “no plans to change our posture in Qatar” amid the diplomatic crisis. Qatar is home to the sprawling al-Udeid airbase, which houses the US military’s central command and 10,000 American troops.\n\nQatar has long faced criticism from its Arab neighbours over its support of Islamists and Doha has long welcomed senior figures from Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nThe Saudi’s chief worry is the Muslim Brotherhood, the transnational Sunni Islamist political movement outlawed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which regards it as posing a threat to their system of hereditary rule.\n\n\n\nGulf countries led by Saudi Arabia fell out with Qatar over its backing of the former Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood member, and in March 2014, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors from Qatar over the rift.\n\nDiplomatic relations resumed eight months later when Qatar forced some Brotherhood members to leave the country and quieted others but the 2014 crisis did not involve a land and sea blockade, as is threatened now.\n\nThe Qatar Council issued a fresh statement on Monday afternoon seeking to reassure its citizens that it had taken the necessary steps to ensure normal life continued, including by keeping sea ports open for trade and making sure that air space with countries not involved in the boycott remained open. It said it would not expel the 300,000 Egyptians working in Qatar as a reprisal.\n\nQatar blockade could hit state airline, al-Jazeera and World Cup Read more\n\nSaudi Arabia however kept up the pressure on Qatar by saying it was withdrawing al-Jazeera’s media licence and closing its Saudi office, saying the Qatar-funded broadcaster had promoted terrorist plots and supported the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nIt also banned all Qatar flagged vessels from is ports and lorries due to enter Qatar over the Saudi border were blocked from doing so.\n\nThe Saudi aim is to apply pressure to make Qatar change its foreign policy, but questioning the legitimacy of a fellow monarch could prove to be a double edged sword for any Gulf ruler.\n\nSince 2014, Qatar has repeatedly and strongly denied that it funds extremist groups. However, it remains a key financial patron of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and has been the home of the exiled Hamas official Khaled Mashaal since 2012. One of the first signs of any compromise will be the withdrawal of Hamas leaders from Doha.\n\nWestern officials have also accused Qatar of allowing or even encouraging funding of Sunni extremists such as al-Qaida’s branch in Syria, once known as the Nusra Front.\n\nThe row comes only two weeks after the US president, Donald Trump, visited the Middle East to seal major defence contracts with Saudi Arabia worth $110bn, set up an anti-extremist institute in Riyadh and urge the Gulf states to build an alliance against Iran.\n\n\n\nThe Saudis are in part countering the allegation of funding extremism, frequently made in Washington and in the past by Trump himself, by pointing the finger at Qatar for backing terrorism.\n\nSpeaking in Australia, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, played down the seriousness of the diplomatic dispute and said it would not affect counter-terrorism efforts.\n\n“I think what we’re witnessing is a growing list of irritants in the region that have been there for some time, and they’ve bubbled up so that countries have taken action in order to have those differences addressed,” he said.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/05/saudi-arabia-and-bahrain-break-diplomatic-ties-with-qatar-over-terrorism","1496635200.0"

"Amazon And The $150 Million Typo\nAmazon And The $150 Million Typo\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Reed Saxon/AP Reed Saxon/AP\n\nAmazon says a typo caused its cloud-computing service to fail earlier this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, part of Amazon Web Services stopped working. The company's so-called simple storage service, or S3, provides features ranging from file sharing to web feeds.\n\nIn an online statement, Amazon described the circumstances of the disruptive typo this way:\n\n'The Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) team was debugging an issue causing the S3 billing system to progress more slowly than expected. At 9:37AM PST, an authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process. 'Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended.'\n\nThe company did not elaborate on what, exactly, the 'authorized S3 team member' mistyped, but did say that it took about three hours to get some of the system back up, and more than four hours before the S3 system was back to normal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the outage 'cost companies in the S&P 500 index $150 million, according to Cyence Inc., a startup that specializes in estimating cyber-risks.

"Great Britain? How the UK shapes up against the rest of the world\n(CNN) People in Britain are heading to the polls for a snap election, just two years after the last vote, and hot on the heels of the Brexit and Scottish independence referendums.\n\nWhile Brexit remains a core concern for voters, traditional issues such as the economy, immigration and healthcare have dominated.\n\nHere's how the UK stacks up against the rest of the world:\n\nECONOMY\n\nThe economy is one of the issues British voters care most about, according to the UK polling service YouGov -- and it's at the center of the main parties' campaign rhetoric.\n\nBut with departure from the EU looming, financial uncertainty abounds: investments are on hold, some companies have said they will move thousands of jobs out of the UK, and retail spending is low. For ordinary Britons, financial insecurity has been felt by poor wage increases and job insecurity for the last decade.\n\nAs unemployment levels have dropped, wages have stagnated. The numbers of people on controversial zero-hours contracts (which don't guarantee any job security, benefits, or workers' rights) and short-hours contracts (which guarantee as little as one hour's work a month) have risen, according to the ONS.\n\nNearly a million people in Britain were on zero-hours contracts by the end of 2016, according to the ONS -- a 13% surge on the previous year. The Labour party has promised to end zero-hours contracts and unpaid internships if elected in; Theresa May's Conservative party says it will 'review' the practice.\n\nThere are more jobs on the books, and unemployment is at its lowest level in four decades, but many British workers are still facing a precarious balancing act to make ends meet.\n\nAnd to make it worse, income inequality is on the rise.\n\nONS figures show there has been a gradual decrease in income inequality in the UK over the last decade, but state benefits and tax credits are papering over the cracks\n\nIn real terms, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer -- though this is by no means unique to the UK.\n\nIncome inequality in the world's richest countries is at its highest level in decades , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nImmigration is one of the issues that shaped the Brexit debate, a key subject in many parties' political manifestos and a daily topic of conversation in the UK.\n\nTheresa May has vowed to cut net migration down to the tens of thousands, double the amount companies must pay to hire workers from countries outside the EU and raise the financial threshold required for British citizens who want to bring their non-EU spouses and families to live with them (currently set at £18,600).\n\nLabour says it will scrap many of those policies, but there's at least one thing they can agree on: after Brexit, the free movement of people between EU countries and the UK will have to end.\n\nAt least 70,877 refugees and migrants have arrived on Europe's shores since the beginning of 2017, according to the UN refugee agency\n\nMore than five million Syrians have fled their homeland since the start of the conflict in 2011. Many British voters have worried about an influx of Syrian refugees, but the UK is nowhere near resettling the number of people they promised to bring in by 2020, under the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme. So far, 7,307 of the 20,000 Syrians the UK said it would help have been given refuge.\n\nThe Conservatives have promised to reduce asylum claims even further if they are re-elected in June.\n\nLabour has stressed the difference between refugees and economic migrants, pledging that that they will not 'scapegoat migrants nor blame them for economic failures' and promised to 'uphold the proud British tradition of honouring the spirit of international law and our moral obligations by taking our fair share of refugees.'\n\nHEALTH\n\nHealthcare is a top issue for many voters, and that's no surprise -- the UK's flagship public health system, the National Health Service (NHS), has been facing serious financial problems for years.\n\nThe system, which is funded through tax and compulsory national insurance contributions, delivers free healthcare to anyone who needs it, across the UK.\n\nThe number of family doctors has barely increased in a decade -- but it's not all bad news for the sick and injured. Hospitals have seen an increase of around 20,000 doctors since 2006, according to the National Health Service.\n\nBut with a growing, aging population, and cuts to health and social care budgets, a perfect storm of problems for an already overstressed and underfunded NHS continues to brew.\n\nIf elected, May's Conservative party has pledged to increase government spending on the NHS by a minimum of £8 billion ($10.36 billion) over the next five years - but hasn't said where it will come from\n\nGlobally, the UK spends about as much as the Canadians, who also have a government-run national health service.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAround 44% of British people have graduated from higher education -- in line with many countries with similar socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nJeremy Corbyn believes higher education is a positive tool for increasing social mobility, and his Labour Party has promised to abolish tuition fees for university students. It says it will pay for education from general taxation.\n\nMay's vision for education is more traditional: she wants to bring back selective grammar schools and increase the number of free schools. Critics argue that May's plans to raise university tuition fees to pay for non-government-funded schools will perpetuate a cycle of inequality.\n\nHOUSING\n\nBuying a house in the UK has never been more difficult -- especially for first-time buyers. Even renting has proved difficult for many in recent years.\n\nAlthough housebuilding has slowly risen from its lowest level in 2010 , construction on new builds remains at historical lows. Homelessness is also on the rise.\n\nBoth the Conservatives and Labour have pledged to build a million affordable homes over the course of the next parliament (by 2022).\n\nCRIME\n\nThe UK records far fewer homicides than many of its European neighbors.\n\nBut an epidemic of knife crime, particularly among young people in large cities, has been rising steadily in recent years. In 2016, 16,747 people in England and Wales were assaulted with a knife, according to ONS figures.\n\nBy contrast, gun crime is of little concern to most British voters: strict laws banning the sale and ownership of handguns have been in force since 1997, and shotguns and rifles require police-issued licenses.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nGlobally, the UK ranks far below the worst polluters, China and the US.\n\nThe UK is halfway to its 2050 target -- to reduce greenhouse gases by 80% from 1990 levels.\n\nAlthough the Conservative Party says it will continue to 'lead the world in environmental protection,' May's commitment to the environment isn't clear.\n\nIn one of her first acts as Prime Minister, she closed the Department of Energy and Climate Change -- folding it into the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.\n\nMay has also supported fracking , a controversial oil and gas production technique that comes with serious environmental risks including earthquakes and water contamination.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/02/europe/uk-economy-immigration-healthcare-charts/index.html","1496376000.0"
"Could China's Trump tactics actually be working?\nImage copyright Xinhua/Alamy Live News Image caption Beijing realised the importance of cultivating relations with Mr Trump's family\n\nIt's been a month and adjusting to Donald Trump as US president has been an enormous challenge for China, as for many around the world.\n\nHe arrived in office full of provocative and unpredictable messaging on China, but Beijing needs American goodwill, markets and technology to build what it calls its 'comprehensive strength'.\n\nThat a functioning relationship with the United States is a core strategic interest for China may seem obvious, but it bears repeating.\n\nFor the time being at least Mr Trump seems to have stopped insulting and threatening China - despite repeating on Friday that he thought they were 'grand champions at manipulation of currency'. Key players in Mr Trump's administration are now making nice on the telephone.\n\nSo what were China's tactics and how did it make them work?\n\n1. Cultivate family, cultivate friends\n\nBeijing quickly understood that President Trump would not run an administration like that of his predecessors.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Mr Trump is an elephant in a China shop for the makers of this float in Germany\n\nIt noted the importance of family.\n\nBefore Mr Trump himself or senior members of his administration talked to key players in China, and while China's internet was full of mutterings about why Mr Trump had delivered no goodwill message over Chinese New Year, Beijing's man in Washington, Ambassador Cui Tiankai, deftly reached out to President Trump's daughter Ivanka.\n\nShe bridged the official divide with a well-publicised appearance at a Chinese New Year function at Beijing's embassy in Washington.\n\nIvanka's husband Jared Kushner also has lines of communication to Beijing through his Chinese business partners.\n\nAnd President Trump's other daughter Tiffany made a point of sitting in the front row of the New York Fashion Week show of Chinese designer Taoray Wang.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Wang and Tiffany Trump have praised each another\n\nTo bolster this network of unofficial connections, China's best known private entrepreneur Jack Ma, met Mr Trump and promised to create a million American jobs through selling US products on his Alibaba e-commerce platforms.\n\nEven private companies in China have Communist Party cells and are required to do Beijing's bidding when it comes to matters of strategic national interest.\n\nJack Ma was on mission and on message. As were the 100 firms which sponsored a Chinese New Year greeting message to Mr Trump on a Times Square billboard in New York.\n\n2. Bring gifts\n\nMr Trump's controversial business empire has multiple trademark cases languishing in Chinese courts.\n\nBeijing makes no bones about the fact that its courts are answerable to the Communist Party.\n\nIt was an easy act of goodwill to speed through a trademark registration for construction services that Mr Trump had sought for a decade, especially as the move was consistent with a wider move against businesses which jump on the names of public figures as trademarks.\n\nImage copyright Chinatopix/AP Image caption After years of wrangling, Chinese courts awarded Mr Trump valuable commercial rights to his name\n\nIn the Trump case, the necessary moves were made quickly and without fanfare last autumn, and the case closed with a victory for Mr Trump last week.\n\n3. Speak softly until you need to speak loud\n\nChina is often quick to thunder against hostile foreign forces and accuse foreign governments of hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.\n\nDonald Trump offered provocations which would bring down retribution on a lesser foe.\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign he insulted and threatened China, calling it a thief and a rapist on trade and challenging its dearest held positions on Taiwan. Officials also warned of a tougher approach in the South China Sea.\n\nBut throughout, Beijing has shown iron self-discipline and restraint.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption China claims almost all the South China Sea, a position the US rejects\n\nChina's official news agency Xinhua noted of Mr Trump: 'He will soon realise that leaders of the two countries must use more mature and effective ways to communicate than trading barbs via Twitter.'\n\nSince Mr Trump's election in November, China's media has been on a tight leash, ordered to use Xinhua's bland wording in its coverage of the US.\n\n4. Don't speak until the script is agreed\n\nUnlike other world leaders, President Xi was conspicuously slow to pick up the phone.\n\nObserving the fallout of President Trump's calls with Mexican and Australian leaders, Beijing was determined to avoid the risk of an undiplomatic incident.\n\nBy hanging back till the administration's 'grown ups' like Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were in the room (figuratively and in some cases literally) China ensured it got the script it wanted.\n\nImage copyright AP Image caption The two leaders did not speak until long after many other leaders had called Mr Trump\n\nWhen the phone call between President Trump and President Xi finally took place, Beijing won a new US commitment to the cherished One China policy and a dignified encounter.\n\nPresident Xi emerged with his reputation as a firm and patient actor enhanced. President Trump had talked of staking out a new position on Taiwan - but stepped back.\n\n5. Sweet talk where it pays\n\nSince that call, the lines between Beijing and Washington DC have been humming.\n\nNewly confirmed US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has talked to several key Chinese players on economic policy. Mr Tillerson has met his opposite number, Wang Yi, and senior diplomat Yang Jiechi.\n\nBeijing has begun to talk of implementing 'the consensus reached between President Xi and President Trump' - a relationship featuring 'no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation'.\n\n6. Give what you can\n\nIn practical terms, China knows that win-win will mean delivering concessions and co-operation wherever it can. And it has already shown willing in one area of US concern, with the suspension of coal imports from North Korea.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption By suspending coal imports, China has put pressure on Pyongyang\n\nOf course, Beijing said this decision was a technicality based on quotas.\n\nBut given the provocation of Pyongyang's latest missile test and growing American concern over the advances of North Korea's nuclear programme, this is much more likely to have resulted from a careful Chinese calculation of what carrots it could flourish in the direction of Donald Trump and what sticks it could brandish at Kim Jong-un.\n\n7. Turn your opponent's weakness into your strength\n\nOn the global stage, President Xi has usefully presented himself as not Donald Trump.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, he famously championed globalisation and free trade.\n\nOf course, China is not a paragon of free trade, with a highly protected domestic market. But in a world of 'alternative facts', the rhetoric is powerful.\n\nOn the regional stage, China is promoting itself as a leader on multilateral trade, assiduously taking advantage of the US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, which was intended to underpin American economic leadership in Asia Pacific.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Although the TPP excluded China, it had opponents across the political spectrum in the US\n\nAnd on the Chinese political stage, Mr Trump is indirectly doing Mr Xi's work for him.\n\nThe Communist Party sometimes struggles to defend one-party authoritarian rule against the glamour and appeal of a free, open and democratic America. But the scenes of American street protest and visa chaos from President Trump's first month in office are a propaganda gift.\n\nAn American president joining China's state-controlled media in railing against what he calls fake, failing, dishonest US journalists is a second propaganda gift. Beijing has made extensive use of both for its political purposes at home.\n\nTactics that worked\n\nBeijing will be well satisfied with its performance so far. But this is a multi-player multi-dimensional game with many dangers and traps over the long term.\n\nIt has done a good job of neutralising the risks and exploiting the opportunities of President Trump's first month in office.\n\nRound One to China. There are innumerable rounds still to come.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-39061702","None"

"US warship collides with Japanese tug boat, latest mishap for the Navy's 7th Fleet\nA U.S. warship collided with a Japanese commercial tug boat in Japan's Sagami Bay on Saturday, marking the fifth time this year that a ship in the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet in the Pacific has been involved in a crash.\n\nThe Japanese tug boat lost propulsion and drifted into the USS Benfold during a towing exercise.

"Reuters Top 100: The World's Most Innovative Universities - 2017\n(Reuters) - Tiger economies and competition from China will undoubtedly be forces to reckon with, but anyone looking to find the most influential research leading to the most transformative technologies should look West, not East. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.\n\nNo. 1: Stanford University's campus is seen from atop Hoover Tower in Stanford, California, U.S. on May 9, 2014. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/File Photo\n\nThe most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.\n\nMORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology\n\nOverall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.\n\nIn contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.\n\nNo. 2: A woman walks across the campus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts May 16, 2012. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi\n\nOverall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.\n\nAccording to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.\n\nOf course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nTo compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.\n\nCareful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.\n\nDue to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.\n\nOf course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.\n\nClick here for the full methodology.\n\n(Editing by Arlyn Tobias Gajilan and Alessandra Rafferty)\n\n\n\n","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amers-reuters-ranking-innovative-univ/reuters-top-100-the-worlds-most-innovative-universities-2017-idUSKCN1C209R","1506498280.0"
"Swiss hotel accused of antisemitism over signs singling out Jews\nIsrael asks Swiss government to condemn Paradies hotel after notices on swimming pool and kitchen use are put on Facebook\n\nIsrael has lodged official complaints after a hotel in Switzerland posted signs telling Jewish guests to shower before using the pool and restricted their access to a kitchen freezer.\n\n\n\nThe Paradies apartment hotel in the Alpine village of Arosa, in eastern Switzerland, has been accused of antisemitism after a guest posted to Facebook a picture of a notice near the hotel pool.\n\n“To our Jewish guests, women, men and children, please take a shower before you go swimming,” it said, adding: “If you break the rules I’m forced to [close] the swimming pool for you.”\n\nA second notice, in the kitchen, instructed “our Jewish guests” that they could only access the facility’s freezer between 10 and 11am and between 4.30 and 5.30pm. “I hope you understand that our team does not like being disturbed all the time,” it said.\n\nThe story was published by Israeli papers, prompting a harsh reaction from Israeli officials.\n\nIsrael’s deputy foreign minister, Tzipi Hotovely, described the notices as “an antisemitic act of the worst and ugliest kind”.\n\nJacob Keidar, Israel’s ambassador to Switzerland, reportedly contacted the hotel and later informed Hotovely that the signs had been removed.\n\nBut she was not satisfied and has reportedly demanded formal condemnation from the Swiss government.\n\nA Swiss foreign ministry spokesman said in an email that the ministry had been in contact with Keidar and had “outlined to him that Switzerland condemns racism, antisemitism and discrimination in any form”.\n\nThe Paradies manager, Ruth Thomann, who signed the notices, insisted to the Swiss newspaper 20Minutes that she was not antisemitic, and acknowledged that her “choice of words was a mistake”.\n\nShe told the Blick newspaper that the apartment hotel currently had a lot of Jewish clients, and that other guests had complained that some of them did not shower before using the pool and had asked her to do something.\n\n“I wrote something naive on that poster,” she was quoted as saying, admitting that it would have been better simply to address all guests with the same message.\n\nThe hotel is reportedly very popular with ultra-orthodox Jewish guests because it has been accommodating to their needs, including providing access to a freezer to store kosher food.\n\nThomann told Blick that because the freezer was in a staff room, she had felt compelled to set times when the Jewish guests could access it to ensure staff could enjoy their “lunch and dinner in peace”.\n\nOn Tuesday the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which confronts anti-Semitism and promotes human rights, published a letter asking Switzerland to “close [the] hotel of hate and penalise its management”.\n\nIt called on Booking.com to remove the hotel from its directory “and explain the antisemitic cause of the removal on your website”.\n\nA Booking.com spokeswoman said: “We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We can confirm that the property in question is no longer available on Booking.com.”\n\n\n\n","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/15/swiss-hotel-accused-of-antisemitism-over-pool-warning","1502769600.0"

They show a mark on the White Star ocean liner's starboard side near the seat of the fire, and the point of the collision.\n\n'The anomaly is exactly the place where it struck the iceberg,' he told CNN.\n\n'Accelerated sinking'\n\nMolony said his research suggests the intense fire in one of the coal bunkers, which were three storeys high, reached temperatures of around 1,000 degrees, warped the bulkhead steel and made it brittle.\n\n'The bulkhead was not worthy of the name. It completely compromised the ship and led to an accelerated sinking -- Titanic couldn't stay afloat long enough for an effective rescue,' he said.\n\nMolony said the pictures were taken at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by John Westbeech Kempster on the first two days of April 1912 -- just over a week before it sailed, bound for New York City.\n\nIn the documentary he describes the pictures as 'the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamun's tomb.'\n\nHe told CNN that they were contained in an album which had been put up for sale at an auction in England at the time of the centenary in 2012.\n\nWhy did Titanic speed up?\n\nThe pictures immediately stirred his interest.

"Subaru investigates possible mileage cheating, shares drop\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Subaru Corp (7270.T), already smarting from a vehicle inspection scandal at home, said it was now investigating whether mileage readings may have also been falsified during final checks, driving its shares down as much as 8 percent.\n\nMileage readings, an indicator of fuel efficiency, do not fall under safety requirements. However, any proof of what would be a second instance of misconduct in as many months would taint the image of not only Subaru but also Japan’s manufacturing industry that has been rocked by a slew of scandals recently.\n\nJust last year, Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) saw around 40 percent of its market value, or $3.2 billion, wiped out in three days after it admitted it had overstated the fuel economy of its minivehicles.\n\nSubaru on Wednesday said it was checking to see if any possible fabrication could have impacted its official mileage readings and if any exported models may have been affected.\n\n“At the moment we are trying to confirm whether data was indeed fabricated, and if so, how this happened and which models are affected,” Subaru spokeswoman Miyuki Yasuda said.\n\nShe added that any evidence of falsified mileage figures, which show the number of kilometers a vehicle can travel on a liter of petrol, was unlikely to result in a recall as it would not constitute a violation of safety requirements.\n\nThe mileage probe follows Subaru’s revelation in October that uncertified staff had been for decades carrying out final checks on new cars sold in the domestic market. The company this week vowed to improve oversight, but it did not mention any probe into mileage readings at the time.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nSubaru said reports of falsified mileage readings emerged as external investigators looked into the inspection scandal.\n\nSome inspectors told investigators that mileage data had been altered on some sample vehicle models tested during final checks. Subaru said it had not confirmed that any such fabrications had taken place.\n\n“Coming on the heels of the certified inspection issue, this could be a sign of a bigger problem of how Subaru manages its manufacturing operations,” said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.\n\nSubaru shares fell as much as 8.5 percent to their lowest since July 2016, before ending down 7 percent. The stock has given up almost 10 percent over the past two months amid the inspection scandal.\n\nA series of compliance failings by Japanese companies have surfaced in recent months, hitting the country’s reputation for quality control and prompting calls for better governance.\n\nNissan Motor (7201.T) has admitted to incorrect final inspection procedures. In just the latter half of the year, Kobe Steel (5406.T), Mitsubishi Materials Corp (5711.T) and Torbay Industries (3402.T) - all key suppliers of products to global manufacturers - have admitted to product data fabrication.\n\nFretting about the impact of the string of scandals, nearly half of Japanese firms have either taken steps to strengthen internal controls or are planning to do so, a Reuters poll showed earlier this month.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-subaru-scandal/subaru-investigates-possible-mileage-cheating-shares-drop-idUSKBN1EE0MF","1513774683.0"
"Ex-DEA agent: Opioid crisis fueled by drug industry and Congress\nUpdate: President Trump announced Tuesday that his nominee for drug czar, Rep. Tom Marino, has withdrawn his name from consideration for the position.\n\nIn the midst of the worst drug epidemic in American history, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's ability to keep addictive opioids off U.S. streets was derailed -- that according to Joe Rannazzisi, one of the most important whistleblowers ever interviewed by 60 Minutes. Rannazzisi ran the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, the division that regulates and investigates the pharmaceutical industry. Now in a joint investigation by 60 Minutes and The Washington Post, Rannazzisi tells the inside story of how, he says, the opioid crisis was allowed to spread -- aided by Congress, lobbyists, and a drug distribution industry that shipped, almost unchecked, hundreds of millions of pills to rogue pharmacies and pain clinics providing the rocket fuel for a crisis that, over the last two decades, has claimed 200,000 lives.\n\nCBS News\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: This is an industry that's out of control. What they wanna do, is do what they wanna do, and not worry about what the law is. And if they don't follow the law in drug supply, people die. That's just it. People die.\n\n'This is an industry that allowed millions and millions of drugs to go into bad pharmacies and doctors' offices, that distributed them out to people who had no legitimate need for those drugs.'\n\nJoe Rannazzisi is a tough, blunt former DEA deputy assistant administrator with a law degree, a pharmacy degree and a smoldering rage at the unrelenting death toll from opioids. His greatest ire is reserved for the distributors -- some of them multibillion dollar, Fortune 500 companies. They are the middlemen that ship the pain pills from manufacturers, like Purdue Pharma and Johnson & Johnson to drug stores all over the country. Rannazzisi accuses the distributors of fueling the opioid epidemic by turning a blind eye to pain pills being diverted to illicit use.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: This is an industry that allowed millions and millions of drugs to go into bad pharmacies and doctors' offices, that distributed them out to people who had no legitimate need for those drugs.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Who are these distributors?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: The three largest distributors are Cardinal Health, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen. They control probably 85 or 90 percent of the drugs going downstream.\n\nCBS News\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You know the implication of what you're saying, that these big companies knew that they were pumping drugs into American communities that were killing people.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: That's not an implication, that's a fact. That's exactly what they did.\n\nIn the late 1990s, opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone became a routine medical treatment for chronic pain. Drug companies assured doctors and congressional investigators -- as in this 2001 hearing -- that the pain medications were effective and safe.\n\nPurdue Executive to Congress in 2001: Addiction is not common, addiction is rare in the pain patient who is properly managed.\n\nWith many doctors convinced the drugs posed few risks, prescriptions skyrocketed and so did addiction.\n\nCBS News\n\nMany people who'd become addicted to painkillers turned to shady pill mills -- pain clinics with rogue doctors to write fraudulent prescriptions and complicit pharmacists to fill them -- one-stop shopping for controlled narcotics.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Pain clinics overnight popping-up – off an entrance ramp, or an exit ramp on an interstate. And all of a sudden there's a pain clinic there.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Had you ever seen anything like that before?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Never. In fact-- it was my opinion that this made the whole crack epidemic look like nothing.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI These weren't kids slinging crack on the corner. These were professionals who were doing it. They were just drug dealers in lab coats.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You know what a chilling picture that paints?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I do, 'cause I watched them get arrested, and I was the one who approved the cases.\n\nDespite arrests of unscrupulous purveyors, opioids kept flooding the black market. The death toll kept rising. This map shows the U.S. death rate from drug overdose in 1999. By 2015, the map looked like this. Most of these deaths were opioid related. Joe Rannazzisi told us prosecuting crooked doctors and pharmacists wasn't stemming the epidemic, so he decided to move up the food chain.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: There had to be a choke point. And the choke point was the distributors.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: What took you so long to go to that choke point of the distributors?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: This was all new to us. We weren't seeing just some security violations, and a few bad orders. We were seeing hundreds of bad orders that involved millions and millions of tablets. That's when we started going after the distributors.\n\nCBS News\n\nA distributor's representative told us the problem is not distributors but doctors who overprescribe pain medication, but the distributors know exactly how many pills go to every drug store they supply. And they are required under the Controlled Substances Act to report and stop what the DEA calls 'suspicious orders' -- such as unusually large or frequent shipments of opioids. But DEA investigators say many distributors ignored that requirement.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: They had a business plan. Their plan was to sell a lotta pills and make a lot of money. And they did both of those very well.\n\n'All we were looking for is a good-faith effort by these companies to do the right thing. And there was no good-faith effort. Greed always trumped compliance. It did every time.'\n\nJim Geldhof, a 40-year DEA veteran, ran pharmaceutical investigations from dea's detroit field office. Frank Younker supervised the agency's operations in Cincinnati. Joe Rannazzisi was their supervisor. They saw distributors shipping thousands of suspicious orders. One example: a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, a town of just 392 people, ordered nine million hydrocodone pills over two years.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: All we were looking for is a good-faith effort by these companies to do the right thing. And there was no good-faith effort. Greed always trumped compliance. It did every time. But don't sit here and tell me that, 'Well, we're not sure what a suspicious order is.' Really? I mean this-- this co-- this pharmacy just bought 50 times an amount that a normal pharmacy purchases and they are in a town of 5,000 people. You don't know that that's suspicious? I mean at some point you're just turning a blind eye to it.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: These companies are a big reason for this epidemic?\n\nJIM GELDHOF: Yeah, absolutely they are.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: And I can tell you with 100 percent accuracy that we were in there on multiple occasions trying to get them to change their behavior. And they just flat out ignored us.\n\nIn 2008, the DEA slapped McKesson, the country's largest drug distributor, with a $13.2 million dollar fine. That same year, Cardinal Health paid a $34 million fine. Both companies were penalized by the DEA for filling hundreds of suspicious orders -- millions of pills.\n\nOver the last seven years, distributors' fines have totaled more than $341 million. The companies cried foul and complained to Congress that DEA regulations were vague and the agency was treating them like a foreign drug cartel. In a letter, the healthcare distribution alliance, which represents distributors, told us they wanted to work with the DEA. Effective enforcement, they wrote, 'must be a two-way street.'\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Frank, you said you were tough but fair. The industry says you guys were unfair. That you were taking unfair hits at them.\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: Tell that to the people who lost their sons and daughters. See how fair they think it is.\n\nIn 2011, more than 17,000 Americans died from opioid prescription overdoses. That same year Cardinal Health, the second largest distributor, started pushing back at Joe Rannazzisi. The companies' attorneys went over his head and called his bosses at the Justice Department, who called in Rannazzisi to have him explain his tactics.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: And it in-- infuriated me that I was over there, trying to explain what my motives were or why I was going after these corporations? And when I went back to the office, and I sat down with my staff, I basically said, 'You know, I just got questioned on why we're doing-- why we're doing what we're doing. This is-- this-- this is-- now this is war. We're going after these people and we're not going to stop.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Do you really think you were getting this pushback because you were going after big companies, Fortune 500 companies?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I have no doubt in my mind. So the question is, why would it be any different for these companies as compared to the small mom-and-pops that we had done hundreds of times before.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: What's the difference?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: The difference is, is they have a lot of money, and a lot of influence. And that's the difference.\n\nRannazzisi says the drug industry used that money and influence to pressure top lawyers at the DEA to take a softer approach. Former DEA attorney Jonathan Novak said it divided the litigation office. He said in 2013, he noticed a sea change in the way prosecutions of big distributors were handled. Cases his supervisors once would have easily approved, now weren't good enough.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: We had been achieving incredible success in an almost unstoppable wave, and then suddenly it stopped.\n\nNovak prosecuted cases brought to him by Joe Rannazzisi's investigators. He said his caseload started to slow down dramatically.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: These were not cases where it was black -- where it was grey... These were cases where the evidence was crystal clear that there was wrongdoing going on.\n\nHe said his bosses started to bog down the system, demanding ever more evidence.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: But now, three undercovers by four officers over three months, that wouldn't be enough. Maybe we need an expert to explain how recording equipment works. Maybe we need an expert to explain-- the system for prescribing. What's a prescription? It felt honestly confusing and almost insane. Where was this coming from?\n\nJim Geldhof says his investigations were getting bogged down too. He was looking into one mid-sized distributor that had shipped more than 28 million pain pills to pharmacies in West Virginia over five years. About 11 million of those pills wound up in Mingo County, population 25,000. Suddenly, he said, he ran into roadblocks from one of attorney Jonathan Novak's bosses.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: 'I spent a year working on this case. I sent it down there and it's never good enough. Every time I talked to this guy he wants something else. And I get it for 'em and that's still not good enough.' You know? And this goes on and on and on. When this-- these roadblocks keep-- get thrown up in your face, at that point you know they just don't want the case.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: But this is the DEA. That's what you're supposed to do.\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: Yeah.\n\nJIM GELDHOF: You would think.\n\nThe DEA's toughest sanction is to freeze distributors shipments of narcotics -- a step they haven't taken in almost two years.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: I mean there's no denying the numbers. At the height of the opioid epidemic, inexplicably, they slowed down.\n\nHe said one big reason for the slowdown: DC's notorious revolving door. Novak said he saw a parade of DEA lawyers switch sides and jump to high-paying jobs defending the drug industry. Once they'd made the leap, they lobbied their former colleagues, novak's bosses, and argued the dea's cases were weak and ultimately would lose in court. It had a chilling effect on dea litigators.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: Some of the best and the brightest former DEA attorneys are now on the other side and know all of the -- the -- the weak points. Their fingerprints are on, memos and policy and -- and -- and emails going out where you see this concoction of what they might argue in the future.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You and the other attorneys had been winning these cases.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: All of the time.\n\nThe Justice Department is the agency that oversees the DEA. A senior attorney at the department at the time, told us in a statement, ''Department of Justice leadership was not advised that DEA had changed enforcement strategies...Any significant policy shift should have been brought to [our] attention.''\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: There was a lotta pills, a lotta people dyin', and-- and we had tools in our toolbox to try to use and stem that flow. But it seemed down in headquarters that that toolbox was shut off.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You're watching an out of control epidemic and yet you both feel that at the height of this epidemic your-- your-- your hands were being tied?\n\nFRANK YOUNKER: Yeah, if it's a war on drugs then treat it like a war.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Addiction rate was still increasing. The amount of people seeking treatment was still increasing. It was all increasing. Still, the amount of prescriptions were increasing. And we started slowing down.\n\nAs cases nearly ground to a halt at DEA, the drug industry began lobbying Congress for legislation that would destroy DEA's enforcement powers. That part of the story when we return.\n\nIn 2013, Joe Rannazzisi and his DEA investigators were trying to crack down on big drug distributors that ship drugs to pharmacies across the country. He accused them of turning a blind eye as millions of prescription pain pills ended up on the black market. Then, a new threat surfaced on Capitol Hill. With the help of members of Congress, the drug industry began to quietly pave the way for legislation that essentially would strip the DEA of its most potent tool in fighting the spread of dangerous narcotics.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: If I was gonna write a book about how to harm the United States with pharmaceuticals, the only thing I could think of that would immediately harm is to take the authority away from the investigative agency that is trying to enforce the Controlled Substances Act and the regulations implemented under the act. And that's what this bill did.\n\nThe bill, introduced in the House by Pennsylvania Congressman Tom Marino and Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, was promoted as a way to ensure that patients had access to the pain medication they needed.\n\nJonathan Novak, who worked in the DEA's legal office, says what the bill really did was strip the agency of its ability to immediately freeze suspicious shipments of prescription narcotics to keep drugs off U.S. streets -- what the DEA calls diversion.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: You're not gonna be able to hold anyone higher up the food chain accountable.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Because of this law?\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: Because of this law\n\nBILL WHITAKER: How hard does it make your job in going after the wholesale distributors?\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: I would say it makes it nearly impossible.\n\nThis 2015, Justice Department memo we obtained supports that. It states the bill 'could actually result in increased diversion, abuse, and public health and safety consequences.'\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: They are toothless. I don't know how they stop this now. It's a very sad state of affairs.\n\nWho drafted the legislation that would have such a dire effect? The answer came in another internal Justice Department email released to 60 Minutes and The Washington Post under the Freedom of Information Act: 'Linden Barber used to work for the DEA. He wrote the Marino bill.'\n\nAd: Hi, My name is Linden Barber. I'm the director of the DEA litigation and compliance practice at Quarles and Brady's Health Law Group.\n\nBarber went through the revolving door. He left his job as associate chief counsel of the DEA and within a month joined a law firm where he lobbied Congress on behalf of drug companies and wrote legislation. He advertised what he could offer a client facing DEA scrutiny.\n\nAd continued: If you have a DEA compliance issue, or you're facing a government investigation, or you're having administrative or civil litigation involving the Controlled Substances Act, I'd be happy to hear from you.\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: It's not surprising that this bill, that has intimate knowledge of the way that DEA, you know, regulations are enforced, the way that those laws work, was written by someone who spent a lot of time there, charged a lot of cases there.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Knew the workings?\n\nJONATHAN NOVAK: Very much so.\n\nEric Holder was the attorney general at the time, he warned the new law would undermine law enforcement efforts to ''prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs.'' The major drug companies -- distributors, chain drug stores and pharmaceutical manufacturers -- mobilized too. According to federal filings, during the two years the legislation was considered and amended, they spent $102 million lobbying Congress on the bill and other legislation, claiming the DEA was out of control, making it harder for patients to get needed medication.\n\nA particular thorn for the drug industry and the bill's sponsors was Joe Rannazzisi. He had been a witness before Congress more than 30 times and was called on again to testify about this bill.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: 16,651 people in 2010 died of opiate overdose. OK. Opiate-associated overdose. This is not a game. We are not playing a game.\n\nMARSHA BLACKBURN: Nobody is saying it is a game, sir. We're just trying to craft some legislation. Let me ask you...\n\nRannazzisi, who admits to having a temper, felt so strongly about the damage the bill could do, he lashed out at Marino's committee staffers.\n\nTOM MARINO: It is my understanding that Joe Rannazzisi, a senior DEA official, has publicly accused we sponsors of the bill of --quote supporting criminals --unquote. This offends me immensely.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Congressman Marino from Pennsylvania said that you accused him of helping criminals.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I've never accused Congressman Marino of helping criminals. I said that this bill is going to protect defendants that we have under investigation. And if Congressman Marino thinks I accused him of something, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nBut a week after the hearing on legislation that would hobble the DEA's enforcement authority, Marino and Blackburn wrote the inspector general for the Justice Department, demanding that Rannazzisi be investigated for trying to quote 'intimidate the United States Congress.'\n\nMATT MURPHY: There were people in industry that didn't care much for Joe Ranazzisi, wanted him silenced, or wanted him outta the way. Basically unceremoniously kick him to the curb.\n\nAfter almost 30 years with the DEA, Matt Murphy, Rannazzisi's lieutenant, became a consultant for the drug industry -- an industry with which he's now disillusioned. He said he was shocked at the animosity he witnessed toward his friend and former boss.\n\nMATT MURPHY: My theory is that the industry through lobbying groups donated -- a certain amount of money to politicians to get a law passed that favored the industry. And also maybe using those political ties to have Joe removed.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Congress launched an investigation of him?\n\nMATT MURPHY: Right.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: And he was out?\n\nMATT MURPHY: Yeah, pressure was put on for him to be moved out. I'm pretty confident of that. There was no reason to take the guy who was the most qualified person in DEA to run the Office of Diversion Control out of the Office of Diversion Control.\n\nThe investigation requested by Congressman Marino against Rannazzisi went nowhere, but soon after, Rannazzisi was stripped of his responsibilities. He says he went from supervising 600 people to supervising none -- so he resigned.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: We were totally focused on all these people dying and all these drugs being diverted. And we were not really looking at our flanks, waiting for somebody to come after us. So maybe that was my fault. And I just never realized that that was something that would have occurred.\n\nIn the end, the DEA signed off on the final version of the 'Marino bill.' A senior DEA representative told us the agency fought hard to stop it, but in the face of growing pressure from Congress and industry lobbyists, was forced to accept a deal it did not want. The bill was presented to the Senate in March of 2016.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the legislation to the floor and it passed the Senate through unanimous consent with no objections and no recorded votes.\n\nIt passed the House the same way, with members of Congress chatting away on the floor.\n\nA week later, with no objections from Congress or the DEA, President Barack Obama signed it into law without ceremony or the usual bill signing photo-op. Marino issued a press release the next day claiming credit for the legislation.\n\nThe drug distributors declared victory and told us the new law would in no way limit DEA's enforcement abilities. But DEA chief administrative law judge, John J. Mulrooney, who must adjudicate the law, wrote in a soon-to-be-published Marquette Law Review article we obtained, that the new legislation 'would make it all but...impossible' to prosecute unscrupulous distributors.\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: I just don't understand why Congress would pass a bill that strips us of our authority in the height of an opioid epidemic in places like Congressman Marino's district and Congressman Blackburn's district. Why are these people sponsoring bills, when people in their backyards are dying from drugs that are coming from the same people that these bills are protecting?\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Why do you think that is?\n\nJOE RANNAZZISI: Because I think that the drug industry -- the manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and chain drugstores -- have an influence over Congress that has never been seen before. And these people came in with their influence and their money and got a whole statute changed because they didn't like it.\n\nSeven months after the bill became law, Congressman Marino's point man on the legislation, his Chief of Staff Bill Tighe, became a lobbyist for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.\n\nSince the crackdown on the distributors began, the pharmaceutical industry and law firms that represent them have hired at least 46 investigators, attorneys and supervisors from the DEA, including 32 directly from the division that regulates the drug industry.\n\nMike Gill, chief of staff for the DEA administrator, was hired by HDJN, one of the country's largest healthcare law firms.\n\nAnd most recently, Jason Hadges, a senior DEA attorney overseeing enforcement cases during the slowdown, joined the pharmaceutical and regulatory division of DC-based law firm Hogan Lovells. He declined to speak with us.\n\nAmerisourceBergen and McKesson declined our requests to appear on camera.\n\nSo did Cardinal Health, which three months ago hired the author of the bill, Linden Barber, as senior vice president. With Scott Higham and Lenny Bernstein of the Washington Post, we called the head of public relations of Cardinal and asked to speak with Barber.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: This is Bill Whitaker I'm a correspondent with 60 Minutes, I was calling to see if, um, we could speak with Linden Barber.\n\nWe were told the company would not make him available.\n\nWe also tried for several months to speak to Congressman Marino. Finally, we went to his DC office.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Hello. I'm Bill Whitaker with, uh, 60 Minutes.\n\nMARINO STAFFER: Yes.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: And we'd like to speak with Congressman Marino if we could.\n\nMARINO STAFFER: I'm going to have to refer you to our Chief of Staff.\n\nWe were told he was not available...\n\nMARINO CHIEF OF STAFF: Can you please turn the camera off and we have to ask the camera to leave the office.\n\nHis staff then called the Capitol Hill Police on us.\n\nCAPITOL POLICE: Just accept the uninvite and leave the area.\n\nWhen Joe Rannazzisi looks back he has one regret.\n\nJoe Rannazzisi: You know all these people that died happened under my watch. The one thing I wanted to do, the one thing that I just thought would have the most impact, is to lock up, arrest one of these corporate officers. You arrest a corporate officer. You arrest somebody that's involved in the decision process, knowing what the law is. If you make that arrest, then everybody sits up and takes notice because three-piece-suit guys just don't do well in prison. They don't.\n\nJoe Rannazzissi now consults with state attorneys general who have filed suit against distributors for their role in the opioid crisis. Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is running for the Senate. As for Congressman Marino, he was just nominated to be President Donald Trump's new drug czar.\n\nCorrection: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought the Marino bill to the Senate floor where it passed. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sen. McConnell introduced the bill.\n\nCorrection: According to federal filings, $102 million was spent by major drug companies -- distributors, chain drug stores and pharmaceutical manufacturers -- lobbying Congress on the Marino bill and other legislation. A previous version of this article incorrectly said that amount was $106 million.\n\nProduced by Sam Hornblower and Ira Rosen. Alex J.

"Hurricane Harvey downgraded to Category 3 storm as winds weaken, makes second landfall\nFive hours after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas around 10 p.m. as a Category 4 storm, it was downgraded to a Category 2 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph, a decrease from 130 mph when it made landfall.\n\nInterested in Hurricane Harvey? Add Hurricane Harvey as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Harvey news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAnd Harvey was downgraded to a Category 3 storm around 1 a.m., after winds decreased to 125 mph.\n\nHarvey also made a second landfall on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay around the time it was downgraded to Category 3.\n\nThe storm is the strongest to hit the state in decades, with catastrophic flooding expected. The last Category 4 storm to hit the U.S. was Charley in 2004 in Florida, while the last Category 4 storm to hit Texas was Carla in 1961.\n\nResidents staying in the area frantically stocked up on food, water and gas, while others heading out of the storm's path boarded up windows and doors of their homes and businesses.\n\nAirlines canceled flights, schools were shuttered while concerts and other planned events in Houston and coastal cities were postponed.\n\nThe hurricane's effects are expected to linger for days, with heavy rainfall through next week estimated to be as high as 40 inches in some areas.\n\nTNS via Newscom\n\n'This is going to be a storm we talk about, unfortunately, for at least the next seven days,' ABC News Chief Meteorologist Ginger Zee said Friday on 'GMA.'\n\nBrian Thevenot/Reuters\n\nHere's what we know about the storm.\n\nWhat's ahead\n\nHarvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane over the northern end of San Jose Island between Port Aransas and Port O'Connor at 10 p.m. local time Friday, with sustained winds of about 130 mph and stronger gusts, according to the National Weather Service. At the time, the storm's eye was 30 miles away from the coastal city of Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned Harvey could bring a potentially devastating storm surge, heavy rainfall and wind hazards to the Lone Star State's coast. A tornado watch is in effect for areas of southeastern Texas and southwest Louisiana.\n\nLife-threatening storm surge waters could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level. Catastrophic flooding is expected across parts of the area. And rainfall will be heavy, with an estimated 15 to 30 inches of rain falling in many areas and as high as 40 inches in some from today through Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nABC News\n\nHere's a projected timeline for Hurricane Harvey thus far, according to forecasts from the National Weather Service:\n\nSaturday: Harvey roared ashore late Friday evening. The storm's path going forward remains uncertain but it is forecast to meander near or just inland of the middle of the Texas coast through the weekend.\n\nSunday through Monday: Some forecast models show Harvey expanding across the Gulf Coast as it makes its way over southern Texas.\n\nTuesday through Wednesday: The hurricane could, according to some models, move northeast and then re-emerge briefly over the Gulf of Mexico before making a second landfall in northeastern Texas or western Louisiana.\n\nABC News\n\nPreparation and evacuations\n\nStorm preparation began in earnest on Wednesday and intensified on Thursday. Shoppers lined up to fill their carts with food and water, while lines for gas stretched out of many stations. Some people also got to work boarding up their homes and businesses to protect against the expected 100-plus mile per hour winds. Even the Texas Department of Transportation in Victoria boarded up its windows on Thursday.\n\nAs of Friday, governors had declared states of emergencies for 30 counties in Texas and statewide for Louisiana.\n\nCorpus Christi resident Alex Garcia bought bottled water, bread and other basic grocery items in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land because they were likely more available there than back home, where stores were 'crazy,' he told The Associated Press.\n\nAnd as Houston resident Bill Pennington prepared his one-story home for another deluge in the flood-prone city, the father told The Associated Press he comforted his nervous 9-year-old son by saying, 'We know how to handle it. We'll handle it again.'\n\nAP\n\nThe Coast Guard said Thursday it was sending shallow-depth vessels to Texas and Louisiana that are capable of responding in flooded urban areas. And with gale force winds predicted to arrive within 24 hours, the Coast Guard on Thursday also ordered a nearly total closure of ports in Houston, Texas City, Galveston, Freeport and Corpus Christi.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the Coast Guard had already completed its first search-and-rescue mission, rescuing 12 people from a 160-foot vessel near Port Mansfield, Texas.\n\nTexas officials announced mandatory evacuations for all seven counties on the coast: Calhoun County, San Patricio County, Refugio County, Brazoria County, Jackson County, Victoria County and Matagorda County. In four of those countries, officials ordered their entire county to evacuate and warned those who chose to stay behind that their rescue could not be guaranteed. Voluntary evacuations were urged for residents in other areas.\n\nWhile a mandatory evacuation order is not in place for Corpus Christi, Mayor Joe McComb did advise residents to voluntarily evacuate ahead of the storm.\n\nMayor McComb strongly encourages evacuation, especially the low lying areas of Area A and B as seen in the map below (pink and yellow area). pic.twitter.com/Z5gspafgSn — CityOfCorpusChristi (@cityofcc) August 24, 2017\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long urged people in the path of the storm to heed warnings and to take evacuation orders seriously.\n\n'This may be the first major landfall hurricane we've had since 2005,' Long said in an interview on 'Good Morning America' Friday. 'So there's going to be damage.'\n\nAs of Friday morning, FEMA had amassed more than 96,000 liters of water, 306,000 meals and 4,500 tarps at incident support bases in Seguin and Fort Worth, Texas, as well as in Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, should the states need them.\n\nStorm preparations have extended to New Orleans, where FEMA said it's working to make sure the Louisiana city's pumps are functioning in anticipation of the seven to 10 inches of rainfall expected there. The National Guard is also readying 500,000 sandbags, FEMA said.\n\nMore than 120,000 people have lost power in the Corpus Christi area as a result of Hurricane Harvey so far.\n\nABC News\n\nHow officials are responding\n\nPoliticians and officials have taken a proactive approach to the storm.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday night that he had discussed storm preparation with President Donald Trump, as well as with the heads of FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. On Friday, Abbott sent a letter to Trump requesting a presidential disaster declaration in anticipation of Hurricane Harvey.\n\n“Granting this request will provide Texans the additional resources needed to protect themselves, their property and rebuild their lives if necessary after Hurricane Harvey,” Abbott said in a statement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the press briefing Friday afternoon that Trump is planning to visit Texas 'early next week.'\n\nMany state and local officials have urged residents to pay attention to evacuation orders, as it will be too late to leave once the storm hits.\n\nSpoke with Pres.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2017\n\nTexas' hurricane history\n\nThe storm is already being compared to Hurricane Bret, which hit Texas on Aug. 22, 1999. That storm made landfall in Kenedy County, just south of Corpus Christi, according to the National Weather Service -- a path that was similar to the one forecast for Hurricane Harvey.\n\nHere's a timeline of some of the recent hurricanes to hit Texas and the damage they caused:\n\nHurricane Bret (Aug. 22, 1999): The Category 3 storm made landfall on a Sunday evening about 60 miles south of Corpus Christi. Luckily, the area is sparsely populated compared to Corpus Christi, and so problems were limited. Central Kenedy County received more than 15 inches of rain over two days, according to the NWS. The storm did about $88 million in damages in 2017 figures. Four Americans died in the storm.\n\nHurricane Claudette (July 15, 2003): While Claudette came ashore as only a Category 1 storm with maximum winds of 90 miles per hour, it did extensive damage after coming ashore at Port O'Connor, about 100 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, and moving inland across Calhoun County, according to the NWS. Two people were killed.\n\nHurricane Rita (Sept. 24, 2005): The last Category 3 storm to make landfall in Texas was Rita, though it did so much farther north than Harvey is expected to land. Rita, which hit just three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, made landfall right along the Texas-Louisiana border with sustained winds of 120 miles per hour. The town of Center, Texas -- near Nacogdoches -- received 10.48 inches of rain in the storm, but it moved quickly through the area, limiting rainfall accumulation. Still, 59 people from Texas were killed in the storm, according to the NWS, and a number of others died in a bus accident during evacuations.\n\nHurricane Ike (Sept. 13, 2008): Ike, the last hurricane to make landfall in Texas, hit near Galveston as a Category 2 storm after decimating areas of the Caribbean in the week prior with winds as high as 145 miles per hour. By the time it hit Galveston, winds were at a sustained maximum of 110 miles per hour, according to the NWS. The massive size of Ike resulted in substantial rainfall totals for the area. The highest total was 18.9 inches near Spring Creek, south of Houston, according to the NWS. Some sensors measuring storm surge actually failed due to salt water, according to a NOAA report, but the highest total was 17.5 feet in Chambers County.\n\nMark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images","http://abcnews.go.com/US/hurricane-harvey-makes-landfall-texas-category-storm/story?id=49412285","None"
"Hackers Hit Dozens of Countries Exploiting Stolen N.S.A. Tool\nSecurity experts described the attacks as the digital equivalent of a perfect storm. They began with a simple phishing email, similar to the one Russian hackers used in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other targets last year. They then quickly spread through victims’ systems using a hacking method that the N.S.A. is believed to have developed as part of its arsenal of cyberweapons. And finally they encrypted the computer systems of the victims, locking them out of critical data, including patient records in Britain.\n\nThe connection to the N.S.A. was particularly chilling. Starting last summer, a group calling itself the “Shadow Brokers” began to post software tools that came from the United States government’s stockpile of hacking weapons.\n\nThe attacks on Friday appeared to be the first time a cyberweapon developed by the N.S.A., funded by American taxpayers and stolen by an adversary had been unleashed by cybercriminals against patients, hospitals, businesses, governments and ordinary citizens.\n\nSomething similar occurred with remnants of the “Stuxnet” worm that the United States and Israel used against Iran’s nuclear program nearly seven years ago. Elements of those tools frequently appear in other, less ambitious attacks.\n\nThe United States has never confirmed that the tools posted by the Shadow Brokers belonged to the N.S.A. or other intelligence agencies, but former intelligence officials have said that the tools appeared to come from the N.S.A.’s “Tailored Access Operations” unit, which infiltrates foreign computer networks. (The unit has since been renamed.)\n\nThe attacks on Friday are likely to raise significant questions about whether the growing number of countries developing and stockpiling cyberweapons can avoid having those same tools purloined and turned against their own citizens.\n\nThey also showed how easily a cyberweapon can wreak havoc, even without shutting off a country’s power grid or its cellphone network.\n\nIn Britain, hospitals were locked out of their systems and doctors could not call up patient files. Emergency rooms were forced to divert people seeking urgent care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Russia, the country’s powerful Interior Ministry, after denying reports that its computers had been targeted, confirmed in a statement that “around 1,000 computers were infected,” which it described as less than 1 percent of its total. The ministry, which oversees Russia’s police forces, said technicians had contained the attack.\n\nSome intelligence officials were dubious about that announcement because they suspect Russian involvement in the theft of the N.S.A. tools.\n\nBut James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said he suspected that criminals operating from Eastern Europe acting on their own were responsible. “This doesn’t look like state activity, given the targets that were hit,” he said.\n\nThose targets included corporate computer systems in many other countries — including FedEx in the United States, one of the world’s leading international shippers, as well as Spain’s Telefónica and Russia’s MegaFon telecom giant.\n\nIt could take months to find who was behind the attacks — a mystery that may go unsolved. But they alarmed cybersecurity experts everywhere, reflecting the enormous vulnerabilities to internet invasions faced by disjointed networks of computer systems.\n\nThere is no automatic way to “patch” their weaknesses around the world.\n\n“When people ask what keeps you up at night, it’s this,” said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York security firm tracking the attacks. Mr. Camacho said he was particularly disturbed at how the attacks spread like wildfire through corporate, hospital and government networks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many suspected that the United States government itself had told Microsoft, after the N.S.A. realized that its hacking method exploiting the vulnerability had been stolen.\n\nPrivacy activists said if that were the case, the government would be to blame for the fact that so many companies were left vulnerable to Friday’s attacks. It takes time for companies to roll out systemwide patches, and by notifying Microsoft of the hole only after the N.S.A.’s hacking tool was stolen, activists say the government would have left many hospitals, businesses and governments susceptible.\n\n“It would be deeply troubling if the N.S.A. knew about this vulnerability but failed to disclose it to Microsoft until after it was stolen,” Patrick Toomey, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said on Friday. “These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world.”\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the White House created a process to review software vulnerabilities discovered by intelligence agencies, and to determine which should be “stockpiled” for future offensive or defensive cyberoperations and which should be reported to the companies so that they could be fixed.\n\nLast year the administration said that only a small fraction were retained by the government. But this vulnerability appeared to be one of them, and it was patched only recently, suggesting that the N.S.A. may have concluded the tool had been stolen and therefore warned Microsoft.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that was clearly too little, and far too late.\n\nOn Friday, hackers took advantage of the fact that vulnerable targets — particularly hospitals — had yet to patch their systems, either because they had ignored advisories from Microsoft or because they were using outdated software that Microsoft no longer supports or updates.\n\nThe malware was circulated by email. Targets were sent an encrypted, compressed file that, once loaded, allowed the ransomware to infiltrate its targets. The fact that the files were encrypted ensured that the ransomware would not be detected by security systems until employees opened them, inadvertently allowing the ransomware to replicate across their employers’ networks.\n\nEmployees at Britain’s National Health Service had been warned about the ransomware threat earlier on Friday. But it was too late. As the disruptions rippled through at least 36 hospitals, doctors’ offices and ambulance companies across Britain, the health service declared the attack a “major incident,” warning that local health services could be overwhelmed.\n\nBritain’s health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was briefed by cybersecurity experts, while Prime Minister Theresa May’s office said on television that “we’re not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised.”\n\nAs the day wore on, dozens of companies across Europe, Asia and the United States discovered that they had been hit with the ransomware when they saw criminals’ messages on their computer screens demanding $300 to unlock their data. But the criminals designed their ransomware to increase the ransom amount on a set schedule and threatened to erase the hostage data after a predetermined cutoff time, raising the urgency of the attack and increasing the likelihood that victims would pay.\n\nWithout the ability to decrypt their data on their own, security experts said that victims who had not backed up their data were faced with a choice: Either live without their data or pay. It was not clear how many victims ultimately paid.\n\nSecurity experts advised companies to immediately update their systems with the Microsoft patch.\n\nUntil organizations use the Microsoft patch, Mr. Camacho said, they could continue to be hit — not just by ransomware, but by all kinds of malicious tools that can manipulate, steal or delete their data.\n\n“There is going to be a lot more of these attacks,” he said. “We’ll see copycats, and not just for ransomware, but other attacks.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/world/europe/uk-national-health-service-cyberattack.html","1494561600.0"
"Special Report: Cancer agency left in the dark over glyphosate evidence\nLONDON (Reuters) - When Aaron Blair sat down to chair a week-long meeting of 17 specialists at the International Agency for Research on Cancer in France in March 2015, there was something he wasn’t telling them.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A migrant laborer weeds a melon field during the early morning in Somerton, Arizona, June 7, 2006. REUTERS/Jeff Topping/File Photo\n\nThe epidemiologist from the U.S. National Cancer Institute had seen important unpublished scientific data relating directly to a key question the IARC specialists were about to consider: Whether research shows that the weedkiller glyphosate, a key ingredient in Monsanto’s best-selling RoundUp brand, causes cancer.\n\nPreviously unreported court documents reviewed by Reuters from an ongoing U.S. legal case against Monsanto show that Blair knew the unpublished research found no evidence of a link between glyphosate and cancer. In a sworn deposition given in March this year in connection with the case, Blair also said the data would have altered IARC’s analysis. He said it would have made it less likely that glyphosate would meet the agency’s criteria for being classed as “probably carcinogenic.”\n\nBut IARC, a semi-autonomous part of the World Health Organization, never got to consider the data. The agency’s rules on assessing substances for carcinogenicity say it can consider only published research – and this new data, which came from a large American study on which Blair was a senior researcher, had not been published.\n\nThe lack of publication has sparked debate and contention. A leading U.S. epidemiologist and a leading UK statistician – both independent of Monsanto – told Reuters the data was strong and relevant and they could see no reason why it had not surfaced.\n\nMonsanto told Reuters that the fresh data on glyphosate could and should have been published in time to be considered by IARC, and that the failure to publish it undermined IARC’s classification of glyphosate. The legal case against Monsanto, taking place in California, involves 184 individual plaintiffs who cite the IARC assessment and claim exposure to RoundUp gave them cancer. They allege Monsanto failed to warn consumers of the risks. Monsanto denies the allegations.\n\nThe company also goes beyond saying the fresh data should have been published. It told Reuters the data was deliberately concealed by Blair, but provided no specific evidence of it being hidden.\n\nBlair told Reuters the data, which was available two years before IARC assessed glyphosate, was not published in time because there was too much to fit into one scientific paper. Asked whether he deliberately did not publish it to avoid it being considered by IARC, he said that was “absolutely incorrect.” He said a decision not to publish the glyphosate data had been taken “several months” before IARC chose to conduct a review of the chemical.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute also cited “space constraints” as the reasons why the new data on glyphosate was not published.\n\nAT ODDS\n\nThe absence of the data from IARC’s assessment was important. IARC ended its meeting in 2015 by concluding that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen.” It based its finding on “limited evidence” of carcinogenicity in humans and “sufficient evidence” in experimental animals. It said, among other things, that there was a “positive association” between glyphosate and blood cancers called non-Hodgkin lymphoma. IARC told Reuters that, despite the existence of fresh data about glyphosate, it was sticking with its findings.\n\nThe agency’s assessment is at odds with other international regulators who have said the weedkiller is not a carcinogenic risk to humans. It led to a delay in Europe on a decision on whether to re-license or ban EU-wide sales of pesticides containing glyphosate. That decision is still pending. In the meantime, some countries have tightened restrictions on the weedkiller’s use in private gardens and public spaces and on crops before harvest.\n\nIn the United States, a California judge took the IARC assessment into account in a separate legal case in March when ruling that the state can require RoundUp to carry a warning label that it may cause cancer. Monsanto is now facing further litigation from hundreds of plaintiffs across the United States who say glyphosate gave them or their loved ones non-Hodgkin lymphoma, citing the IARC assessment as part of their claims.\n\nYet if the IARC panel experts had been in a position to take into account Blair’s fresh data, IARC’s analysis of the evidence on glyphosate would have been different, Blair acknowledged in the court documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe unpublished research came from the Agricultural Health Study, a large and significant study, led by scientists at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, of agricultural workers and their families in the United States. Asked by Monsanto lawyers in March whether the unpublished data showed “no evidence of an association” between exposure to glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Blair replied: “Correct.”\n\nAsked in the same deposition whether IARC’s review of glyphosate would have been different if the missing data had been included, Blair again said: “Correct.” Lawyers had put to him that the addition of the missing data would have “driven the meta-relative risk downward,” and Blair agreed.\n\nScott Partridge, Monsanto’s vice president of strategy, told Reuters the IARC glyphosate review “ignored multiple years of additional data from the largest and most comprehensive study on farmer exposure to pesticides and cancer.”\n\nThe Agricultural Health Study was particularly pertinent, he said, because it examined real-life human exposure to glyphosate, whereas much of the scientific research IARC analyzed involved laboratory tests on rodents.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Rows of corn wait to be harvested in a field in Minooka, Illinois, September 24, 2014. To match Special Report GLYPHOSATE-CANCER/DATA REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo\n\nIARC told Reuters that its evaluations follow strict scientific criteria and that its carcinogen classification system “is recognized and used as a reference all around the world.” It reiterated that in the interests of transparency it considers only published data.\n\nReuters asked two independent statistical experts to review the data, which has still not been published, though the National Cancer Institute told Reuters researchers are currently working on an updated analysis of it. Neither of the two experts had seen the data before and both said they had no conflict of interest over glyphosate.\n\nDavid Spiegelhalter, a professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Britain’s University of Cambridge, said there was “no apparent scientific reason” for not publishing the data. Bob Tarone, a retired statistician who worked alongside Blair and others at the National Cancer Institute for 28 years before moving to the for-profit International Epidemiology Institute, said he could find “no ready explanation in terms of the available scientific evidence” for the data not to have been published.\n\nTarone had already raised the issue in a little-noticed paper in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention last year. He wrote that IARC’s classification of glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans was the result of “a flawed and incomplete summary” of the evidence.\n\nIn an email to Reuters, IARC declined to say whether Blair informed IARC staff about the unpublished data, whether he should have, and whether that data might have changed IARC’s evaluation of glyphosate had it been published in time. The agency said it had no plans to reconsider its assessment of the chemical.\n\nNON-SELECTIVE HERBICIDE\n\nGlyphosate is what’s known as a non-selective herbicide, meaning it kills most plants. Discovered by the Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970, glyphosate is no longer under patent, is supplied by numerous companies and is now the world’s most widely used weedkiller, deployed in agriculture, forestry and domestic gardening. Monsanto and other companies have developed genetically engineered seeds that can tolerate glyphosate, allowing farmers to apply it to entire fields without destroying crops.\n\nThe safety of the chemical has been under scientific and regulatory scrutiny since the 1980s. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other international bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority, Health Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency, New Zealand’s Environmental Protection Authority and Japan’s Food Safety Commission, have kept it under regular review, and all say glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans.\n\nBut it is not settled science, and researchers across the world continue to study glyphosate - measuring traces of it in water and foods, exposing lab rats to it, and monitoring possible health effects in people who have used it year after year in their work.\n\nOne of the largest and most highly regarded studies to examine effects of pesticide use in real life is the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective investigation of about 89,000 agricultural workers, farmers and their families in Iowa and North Carolina. Since the early 1990s, it has gathered and analyzed detailed information on the health of participants and their families, and their use of pesticides, including glyphosate.\n\nAHS researchers have published numerous studies from their data. One paper looking at glyphosate and possible links with cancers was published in 2005. It concluded that “glyphosate exposure was not associated with cancer incidence overall.” Since then, more data has been collected, adding statistical power to subsequent AHS analyses.\n\nIn early 2013, Blair and other researchers began preparing new papers with updated AHS data on lymphoma and pesticides, including data on glyphosate. Reuters reviewed drafts dated February 2013 and March 2013, and asked Spiegelhalter and Tarone to examine them. They said the papers, while still in the editing process, were in relatively advanced manuscript form. The drafts contain notes in the margin and suggested changes signed “AEB,” Blair’s full initials.\n\nAfter studying the draft papers, Tarone said the unpublished figures show “absolutely no evidence whatsoever” of an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma because of exposure to glyphosate.\n\nSpiegelhalter told Reuters: “In the drafts I saw, none of the herbicides, including glyphosate, showed any evidence of a relation” with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He noted that the study was statistically strong enough to show a relationship for other pesticides - so had there been any link to glyphosate, it should have shown up.\n\nIn his legal testimony, Blair also described the Agricultural Health Study as “powerful” and agreed the data showed no link.\n\nBut these draft papers were never published, even though Blair told Monsanto’s lawyers in March that the Agricultural Health Study was robust and statistically well-powered, and told Reuters the research was important for science and the public. Email exchanges between Blair and his fellow researchers in 2014 also show they were keenly aware there would be scientific and public interest in fresh AHS data.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nOn February 28, 2014, Michael Alavanja, a co-lead author of one of the draft papers, sent an email to another AHS co-researcher, copying the message to Blair. It noted that the research was “important to science, public health, IARC and EPA” - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn the same email, Alavanja referred to the findings on non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. He wrote: “It would be irresponsible if we didn’t seek publication of our NHL manuscript in time to influence IARCs (sic) decision.”\n\nYet the new AHS data on glyphosate and lymphoma did not surface.\n\nInstead, a revised version of one of the 2013 draft papers prepared by Blair and other researchers appeared in a journal called PLoS One in October 2014. It did not include the data on herbicides, of which glyphosate is one.\n\nThis was unusual. Since 2003 AHS researchers had published at least 10 papers using different rounds of updated data to explore possible links between pesticides and specific diseases. And each one included all four pesticide classes: fungicides, fumigants, insecticides and herbicides.\n\nAlavanja was one of the authors of the paper published in PLoS One in 2014. He said he and other authors and senior scientists at the National Cancer Institute decided to remove herbicides from that analysis primarily because of “the issue of statistical power and the need for a comprehensive evaluation of glyphosate and all cancers.”\n\nBlair told Reuters the data on herbicides, including glyphosate, had been removed “to make the paper a more manageable size.” He gave a similar answer to the lawyer acting for Monsanto, who repeatedly asked in the legal deposition why the data was not published. Blair testified that the paper “went through many iterations.” He said he could not recall when the glyphosate data was removed, but “we decided to remove it because ... you couldn’t put it all into one paper.”\n\nMonsanto argues that the data was not published because it showed no link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nTarone said the absence of herbicide data in the published 2014 paper was “inexplicable,” noting that volume of data had not been an issue in any previous published papers. He said updated AHS data and analyses on herbicides “should be published as soon as possible” to allow “a more complete evaluation of the possible association between glyphosate exposure and NHL risk in humans.”\n\nReuters asked nine other scientists listed as authors on the two draft papers of 2013 why these drafts had never been published. Some were unavailable for comment, and others referred questions to Laura Beane Freeman, who was a co-author on the draft papers and on the 2014 PLoS published study, and is the National Cancer Institute’s current principal investigator of the AHS.\n\nIn an email to Reuters, Freeman and a spokesman for the institute said: “After reviewing early drafts of the manuscript, it became clear that it would be impossible to do a thorough evaluation of all major pesticide groupings due to the sheer volume of information that was important to include.”\n\nThey said the decision to separate the results for herbicides, including glyphosate, allowed the scientists “to present more thorough evaluations” of the remaining pesticides. An updated study on glyphosate is under way, Freeman said.\n\nCULTURE CLASH\n\nDespite IARC’s modest size and budget, its monographs - assessments of whether something is a cause of cancer - often catch the eyes and ears of policymakers and the public. Recent IARC monographs have included judgments that red meat is carcinogenic and should be classified alongside arsenic and smoking, and that coffee, which IARC previously said might cause cancer, probably is not carcinogenic.\n\nThe agency takes a different approach to many other regulators in two important ways. First, it says it assesses “hazard” – the strength of evidence about whether a substance or activity can cause cancer in any way, whether in a laboratory experiment or elsewhere. It does not assess the “risk” or likelihood of a person getting cancer from everyday exposure to something. Second, in general it only considers research that has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nIARC considered around 1,000 published studies in its evaluation of glyphosate. But only a handful of those were cohort studies in humans – the kind like the Agricultural Health Study and the most relevant to real-life situations such as people working with glyphosate in agriculture.\n\nThe differing judgments on glyphosate by IARC and other regulators have stoked clashes on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States members of Congress have launched investigations into American taxpayer funding of IARC. They have yet to reach any conclusions.\n\nIn Europe, the battle centers on the looming decision about whether to re-license glyphosate for use in the European Union. The European Commission has said it wants EU member states to come to a decision by the end of 2017. Politicians will need to weigh the opinions of IARC and other scientific bodies when they decide whether or not to accept a Commission proposal to extend glyphosate’s marketing license by 10 years.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the AHS data will see the light of day in time to be considered. Blair said he thought publishing the glyphosate data would be important and that his former colleagues at the NCI were working on it. The NCI’s Freeman said her team is currently “drafting a manuscript on this topic.” She said the new study “will explore the effects of glyphosate exposure in greater depth than a publication that includes multiple pesticides” and would, she hoped, be submitted “to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming months.”\n\nAlavanja said a draft paper “should be available for submission to an appropriate scientific journal sometime later this year,” but that a publication date “is very difficult to predict.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-glyphosate-cancer-data-specialreport-idUSKBN1951VZ","1497446665.0"
"GE shifts strategy, financial targets for digital business after missteps\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co wants its industrial software business to cut costs and lift profits next year under new chief executive John Flannery, and is considering expanded partnerships and the possible sale of some equity in the unit, according to people familiar with the business.\n\nFILE PHOTO - The ticker and logo for General Electric Co. is displayed on a screen at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on June 30, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nFormer chief executive Jeffrey Immelt spent six years and more than $4 billion transforming 125-year-old GE into a “digital industrial” company. But GE has had technical problems and delays with its software platform, known as Predix, which connects equipment like turbines and elevators to computers that can predict failures and reduce operating costs.\n\nThis spring, GE called an unusual, two month “time-out” to tackle the Predix problems, which have not been previously reported. With fixes in place, GE will now emphasize sales to existing customers in its energy, aviation and oil-and-gas businesses, and scale back efforts to sell to new customers in other sectors, three senior GE executives told Reuters.\n\n“Our resources will go to our fastest-selling markets,” GE Digital Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruh said in an interview.\n\nTo help investors better understand Predix, GE also has redefined digital revenue to exclude $3 billion in hardware related to its gas-fueled power plants, providing a clearer picture of the “pure” software business and avoiding double-counting, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said.\n\nThe company now expects $12 billion in digital revenue in 2020, compared with $15 billion under the old definition. GE’s total revenue hit nearly $124 billion last year.\n\nThe changes mark an important course correction for GE Digital, which so far has not delivered the revenue investors wanted and is partly responsible for a 25 percent decline in GE’s share price this year to a near two-year low.\n\nGE estimates the industrial internet market will be worth $225 billion a year by 2020, and Flannery, who became CEO on Aug. 1, appears committed to Immelt’s vision of being a major player, according to two people familiar with his thinking.\n\nBut the 55-year-old leader, known for finance skills and making tough decisions, is likely to press GE Digital to reduce costs and lift profits next year. He also may restructure how GE Digital operates, bring in more partners and possibly sell a minority stake in the unit, they told Reuters.\n\n“There was a lot of money spent on Predix,” said a former senior financial executive at GE who worked with Flannery. “They are going to tighten the grip and ensure there’s a return.”\n\nGE declined to comment on Flannery’s plans.\n\n“ENDLESS CHECKBOOK”\n\nImmelt was among the first executives to spot the industrial internet wave nearly a decade ago, and positioning the company to catch it became one of his signature strategic moves in his 16 year term as chief executive.\n\n“This is an all-encompassing change,” Immelt said last year, as GE increased its digital investment.\n\nFILE PHOTO - General Electric Co's incoming chief executive John Flannery is shown in this undated handout photo provided June 12, 2017. Courtesy General Electric/Handout via REUTERS\n\nAnalysts and investors see potential for Predix to deliver substantial sales and profits. It already has attracted some large customers, including power utility Exelon Corp and elevator maker Schindler Holding AG, and orders rose 24 percent to $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017.\n\nBut some analysts and investors say the business has taken longer than expected to mature, and its current growth rate is too slow to hit GE’s $12 billion target by 2020. Spending also soared under Immelt, which weighed on profits.\n\n“He gave Bill Ruh an endless checkbook,” Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said of Immelt.\n\nCase in point: GE has budgeted $700 million more in digital spending this year - to a total of $2.1 billion - to further develop Predix and its applications, and to boost sales efforts. GE executives noted this is likely to mark the peak for digital investment.\n\nGE Digital Chief Financial Officer Khozema Shipchandler said the 2020 revenue target is within reach since recurring Predix subscriptions “pile on significant revenue as time goes on.”\n\nFIXING PREDIX\n\nImmelt pushed GE to go digital sooner than other companies. But some early missteps cost time and money as GE’s strategy evolved. Engineers initially advised building data centers that would house the “Predix Cloud.” But after Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp spent tens of billions of dollars on data centers for their cloud services, AWS and Azure, GE changed course.\n\n“That is not an investment we can compete with,” Ruh said.\n\nGE abandoned its go-it-alone cloud strategy a year ago. It now relies on AWS and expects to be using Azure by late October, four months behind schedule, the executives said.\n\nAs GE pivoted away from building data centers, its engineers focused on applications, which executives now saw as more useful for winning business and more profitable than the platform alone.\n\n“That is probably the biggest lesson we’ve learned,” Ruh said.\n\nGE also faced legacy challenges in adapting to Predix software. GE has many algorithms for monitoring its machines, but they mostly were written in different coding languages and reside on other systems in GE businesses. This makes transferring them to Predix more time consuming, people familiar with the system told Reuters.\n\nFILE PHOTO - General Electric Co India's chief executive John Flannery reacts during an interview with Reuters in New Delhi on March 31, 2011. REUTERS/B Mathur/File Photo\n\nThe acquisition of Meridium and ServiceMax over the past 10 months gave GE well-known applications and added about $150 million to annual digital revenue, GE said. But the new products also brought more code that had to be converted to run on Predix, people familiar with the systems said.\n\nThe result: software installation sometimes took much longer than GE anticipated, the code had bugs and applications sometimes lacked features that customers wanted, these people said.\n\nGE executives acknowledged Predix had experienced technical problems and was behind schedule in hitting some goals. During the “time out” in May and June, GE Digital’s programmers made Predix more stable, they said.\n\nThe changes in strategy have come with a change in leadership. Predix chief Harel Kodesh and GE Digital Chief Commercial Officer Kate Johnson both left this year. Patrick Franklin, who succeeded Kodesh, called the “time out” to fix Predix.\n\nRuh said the leadership “evolved with the business” and that GE has the right people to keep Predix growing.\n\nRIVALS TAKE AIM\n\nThe competition is not standing still. Large rivals such as Siemens AG and a crop of nimble startups are pressing to gain market share in GE’s main areas of energy, aviation, locomotives, health care and oil and gas.\n\nChicago-based startup Uptake signed a deal in March with subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy to provide analytics on thousands of wind turbines, including those made by GE. C3 IoT, based in Redwood City, California, won a deal last year with French utility Engie SA, a GE customer. Engie later signed a digital partnership agreement with GE.\n\nStewart & Stevenson, a maker of fracking pumps and other equipment, met with GE about Predix in 2015 but quickly decided against it.\n\n“They didn’t seem to be able to customize to meet the needs of our customers,” said Chris Harvell, the firm’s chief technology officer. “And if they did do any development, we’d probably end up paying quite a bit of money.”\n\nThe company chose Flutura, a 100-person, Houston firm started in 2012, for a pilot. Flutura lacked GE’s scale, but could easily produce custom code, he said.\n\nRuh said that while GE faces competitors in every deal, many startups are not true competitors because Predix includes unique applications and is available globally.\n\n“No other competitor has these capabilities on their platforms,” he said.\n\nInside GE, executives remain bullish. Predix will pay off handsomely if GE stays focused on building it and winning customers, said Joshua Bloom, co-founder and chief technology officer of Wise.io, an artificial intelligence firm GE bought last year.\n\nBut, he said, 'doing that right and at scale is a massive challenge.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-digital-outlook-insight/ge-shifts-strategy-financial-targets-for-digital-business-after-missteps-idUSKCN1B80CB","1504085223.0"
"Police falsely told a man he couldn’t film them. ‘I’m an attorney,’ he said. ‘I know what the law is.’\nDuring a Feb. 26 traffic stop in Wilmington, N.C., Uber driver Jesse Bright pulled out his phone and began filming. One of the officers told Bright to turn his phone off, or he would be taken to jail. (Jesse Bright)\n\nOne of the first things Jesse Bright did after being pulled over by police on a recent Sunday afternoon was turn on his phone and begin filming.\n\nBright was driving for Uber to make some extra cash, but he works full-time as criminal defense attorney in North Carolina. As a lawyer, he said, he believes strongly that when people record their interactions with police, it helps reduce confusion if their cases end up in court.\n\nAs he aimed his phone in the direction of officers and recorded, Bright was surprised to hear Wilmington police Sgt. Kenneth Becker tell him that there was a new state law that prohibited him from recording police.\n\nBright told The Washington Post that he knew better — no such law exists in North Carolina.\n\n“Hey, bud, turn that off, okay?” Becker said.\n\n“No, I’ll keep recording, thank you,” Bright responded. “It’s my right.”\n\n[A black woman called 911 because she was afraid of a police officer.

I can record you.”\n\n“Be careful because there is a new law,” Becker said. “Turn it off or I’ll take you to jail.”\n\n“For recording you?” the video shows Bright asking Becker. “What is the law?”\n\nA tense exchange followed, with Becker telling Bright to step out of his car, calling him “a jerk,” then warning him that he “better hope” officers didn’t find something in his vehicle.\n\nBright continued to record, saying, “I know my rights.”\n\n“I hope so,” said Becker, the police sergeant. “I know what the law is.”\n\n“I know the law,” Bright said. “I’m an attorney, so I would hope I know what the law is.”\n\n“And an Uber driver?” Becker asked.\n\n[She started the night drinking at home — and ended it being pepper-sprayed in a restraint chair]\n\nBright told The Post that he is working for Uber to help pay off his law-school loans. He said he had been hired to take his passenger on a round trip from the man’s home to a location several miles away where, the man said, he was picking up a paycheck on the final Sunday in February.\n\nAfter the passenger returned to the car holding a piece of paper, Bright said he was pulled over moments later.\n\nOfficers searched the passenger and told Bright that he’d brought the man to a drug house that was under surveillance.\n\n“They said I should have known it was a drug house, and I tried to tell them I was an Uber driver,” Bright said. “They thought it was some sort of cover.”\n\nWilmington Police Chief Ralph Evangelous said in a statement this week that his department has “launched an internal investigation” into the Feb. 26 incident.\n\n“Taking photographs and videos of people that are in plain sight including the police is your legal right,” the statement said. “As a matter of fact we invite citizens to do so when they believe it is necessary. We believe that public videos help to protect the police as well as our citizens and provide critical information during police and citizen interaction.”\n\nThe chief added that “a copy of this statement will be disseminated to every officer within the Wilmington Police Department.”\n\nPostTV talked to the International Union of Police Associations and the National Press Photographers Association about civilians' rights when it comes to filming law enforcement. Here's what you should know. (The Washington Post)\n\n[A black mother told police a white man assaulted her child. They arrested her instead.]\n\nBright said officers eventually searched him and his car but didn’t find anything. He said both he and his passenger were told they were free to go and neither man was charged.\n\nIn a statement sent to The Washington Post, Uber said: “We encourage all riders and drivers to follow the law.”\n\nBright said he never had any doubt that Becker was lying to him about the do-not-film law.\n\n“If a police officer gives you a lawful command and that command is disobeyed, they’ll arrest you,” Bright said. “The fact that I wasn’t arrested and he didn’t even try to arrest me is proof that he was being dishonest.”\n\nHe said Becker’s command to stop recording and the searches — to which he didn’t consent — were a violation of his constitutional rights. He noted that suppressing video is in an officer’s best interest because it allows police to dictate the narrative later if a case arises.\n\n“I was mainly surprised because one of the officers who was there has had a trial in court with me and so he recognized me,” he said. “I’d think that once they’d recognized that I was a trial lawyer they would’ve changed their tone and stopped violating my rights.”\n\nDuring his interactions with Becker, Bright also asked a New Hanover County sheriff’s deputy at the scene to tell him whether a new law had, in fact, been passed that would prohibit him from recording police.\n\n“I’ve never heard of this law that you’re not allowed to record the police anymore — it must be brand new,” Bright said.\n\n“Well, they just recently passed it,” the deputy responded.\n\n“Like super recently?” Bright asked. “It seems like a strange law.”\n\n[Yes, you have a right to record the police.]\n\nNew Hanover County Sheriff Ed McMahon told ABC affiliate WWAY that after reviewing the video, it was clear that his deputy was incorrect and has been counseled.\n\nThe sheriff’s department said in a statement that “not only does the Sheriff agree that it is legal to record encounters, he invites citizens to do so.”\n\nBright said he didn’t initially want to share his story to the media, but when Becker refused to return his phone calls and the department never apologized, he decided to go public.\n\nHe said he doesn’t want the officers involved to be punished, but he does hope to let people know that the public has the right to film police.\n\nHis story, he said, should serve as a warning.\n\n“I think the video shows that the police are willing to lie in order to coerce people into doing what they want them to do,” he said. “You just have to know your rights.”\n\nMore reading:\n\n‘My son is not breathing’: Harrowing video shows hero cop saving toddler in distress\n\n‘My brother was murdered’: Video proves NYPD cop’s road-rage killing was unjustified, relatives say","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/10/video-shows-police-telling-an-uber-driver-its-against-the-law-to-record-police-its-not/","1489122000.0"
"Women in Saudi Arabia got the right to drive, but they still can't do these things\nThe announcement that Saudi Arabia will finally allow women to drive has been hailed a watershed moment for gender equality, but the kingdom still has many laws in place that restrict the rights of women, activists say.\n\nInterested in Saudi Arabia? Add Saudi Arabia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Saudi Arabia news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the only country in the world that forbids women from getting behind the wheel, announced that women will be allowed to obtain drivers' licenses for the first time in June 2018.\n\nIn the meantime, a newly-formed committee will develop a plan on how to implement the royal decree in accordance with religious and regulatory standards, presenting its recommendations within 30 days.\n\n'This is a historic big day in our kingdom,' Prince Khaled bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, said during a press conference Tuesday at the Saudi embassy in Washington.\n\nAmbassador bin Salman confirmed women will be allowed to apply for a license, take driving lessons and drive any vehicle without needing legal permission from their male guardians. The choice to do so will be solely up to women, bin Salman said, but he acknowledged 'there might be social issues.'\n\nTasneem Alsultan/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nReacting to the news, U.S. Department of State Spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters at a press briefing, 'It's a great step in the right direction for that country.'\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote on his official Twitter, 'I welcome Saudi Arabia's decision to lift the ban on women drivers. An important step in the right direction.'\n\nBut Saudi Arabia's longstanding ban on women drivers is just one of a number of rules that restrict nearly every aspect of daily life for the ultra-conservative nation's female population. While the new decree marks a breakthrough, Saudi women are still not in the driver's seat when it comes to making many key decisions in their own lives, largely because of the country's male guardianship system, a recent report by Human Rights Watch found.\n\nTasneem Alsultan/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nActivists say the kingdom's guardianship policies effectively render adult women legal minors because they must obtain a male guardian's consent for even the most mundane activities. A woman's father, husband, brother or son constitute a guardian.\n\n'We need to pause and congratulate all of the courageous women activists who have been pushing for this outcome for decades,' Ahmed Benchemsi, advocacy and communications director for Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division, told ABC News. 'However, this should be put in perspective with other violations that do persist.'\n\nHere are 13 things -- among others -- women in Saudi Arabia cannot do freely due to the country's strict laws and guardianship policies.\n\nMarry\n\nWomen cannot wed without the consent of their male guardians, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nDivorce\n\nA woman also needs a male guardian's permission to divorce. And until the divorce is finalized, a woman's husband remains her legal guardian throughout the process, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nMoreover, men may petition the courts to forcibly divorce a female relative from her husband if they deem the marriage 'unfit,' the report found.\n\nHave custody of children\n\nWomen cannot retain custody of their children in a divorce after the kids reach the age of 7 for boys and 9 for girls, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nGet a passport\n\nWomen cannot obtain passports or identification cards without permission of a male guardian, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nTravel\n\nWomen are not allowed to travel abroad without male permission, and they are often not permitted to leave home alone, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nLeave jail\n\nWomen who are convicted of a crime and serve a sentence behind bars cannot leave prison without the permission of a male guardian, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nIn some cases, the guardian refuses.\n\n'There is this feeling that she brought shame upon her family and the honor of her family has been damaged and therefore the guardian won't come and free her,' Benchemsi told ABC News.\n\nOpen a bank account\n\nWomen need the permission of a male guardian to open their own bank account, Benchemsi said, and they can’t open bank accounts for their children without written consent from the child’s father, according to the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nGet a job\n\nThere are few careers in Saudi Arabia that women are allowed to pursue without male consent, according to the Human Rights Watch report, and some companies don't even want to hire women.\n\nDress how they want\n\nSaudi Arabia adheres to a strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law , in which all women must cover their bodies and hair when appearing in public. A headscarf and an abaya, a full-length, loose-fitting robe, must be worn, according to a fact sheet from the U.S. State Department\n\nInteract freely with men\n\nWomen must limit conversations and physical closeness with men who are not family members. They are also segregated from the opposite sex in public spaces including banks, offices, restaurants, and universities, which have a separately designated family section and a section reserved for men, according to the U.S. State Department.\n\nReceive equal inheritance\n\nUnder Saudi Arabia's Sharia inheritance laws, daughters only receive half of what their brothers are entitled to, according to the U.S. State Department.\n\nGet a fair trial\n\nThe testimony of a man in Saudi Arabia's courts equals that of two women, according to the U.S. State Department. In other words, a woman's statement is only worth half of a man's.\n\nSeek medical treatment\n\nWhile the State Department notes that Saudi women can make their own determinations regarding hospital care, the Human Rights Watch report found that a guardian's permission is required for certain medical treatments, including elective surgery and even life-saving procedures.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/women-saudi-arabia-drive-things/story?id=50130702","None"
"Florida snake hunt ignites 'python fever'\nHomestead, Florida (CNN) Donna Kalil couldn't hear a python slithering in the grass with the wind blowing. But spotting a tunnel-shaped snake trail, she disappeared into the cattails hunting for one.\n\nThe Kendall, Florida, resident carried a stick. A knife and 9 mm handgun were attached to her belt.\n\nA real estate investor-turned-amateur python hunter, she spotted a ribbon snake clinging to a leaf. She hoped it was a harbinger of success in her quest to find a Burmese python in the Florida Everglades.\n\nKalil, 54, was among a group of python hunters Thursdayworking to rid Everglades National Park and surrounding areas of the non-native species of pythons that prey on wildlife.\n\nThe 25 hunters selected from 1,000 applicants will be paid to euthanize pythons under a $175,000 pilot program by the South Florida Water Management District . The two-month hunt ends June 1.\n\nThe district hopes the hunters kill many pythons. But if Kalil finds a python, it would be the first snake she will have ever killed. 'I'm not really happy about it,' she said. So, what's a python hunter to do?\n\nHunters the best solution\n\nThe pilot program follows python challenges run by another agency that led to the capture and killing of more than 174 Burmese pythons across Florida in monthlong competitions in 2013 and 2016. Hunters from the Irula tribe in India also separately caught many pythons.\n\nThe Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia. It was first discovered in the Everglades in the late 1970s and began appearing on water management district land in 2005, said LeRoy Rodgers, an invasive species biologist with the water management district.\n\nThe python runs wild with no natural predators in the Florida Everglades.\n\nThe snakes, which have no natural predators in the region, were likely introduced into the Everglades after a significant release, he said. That release was either accidental or intentional, University of Florida researchers say.\n\nThe Everglades, known as the river of grass, is a vast area with a climate perfect for the pythons to hide and thrive. There are no precise population figures, but there are believed to be thousands living in the ecosystem in Miami-Dade County, Rodgers said.\n\nA 2012 study by Virginia Tech University, Davidson College and the US Geological Survey found that pythons caused the populations of rabbits and foxes to vanish and the numbers of raccoons, opossums and bobcats to drop by as much as 99% in the Everglades.\n\nThe giant constrictors have also been discovered farther north in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nThe water district has tried to cull the population in a several ways, including dedicating a staff member to hunting the pythons since 2006, Rodgers said.\n\n'We really haven't found any tool that works better than human hunters going out in the field looking for them,' he said of the snakes that can grow to about 17 feet long and weigh up to 150 pounds.\n\nNot in it for the money\n\nThe water district program will pay $8.10 an hour for up to eight hours of hunting a day. A python measuring 4 feet fetches an additional $50. Each additional foot will draw $25 more. Hunters can make an extra $100 if they kill a python guarding a nest.\n\nStickers from previous python hunts adorn the back of Donna Kalil's SUV.\n\nKalil planned to use her earnings for gas money and to buy gadgets for python hunting such as a drone and spotlights for her sport utility vehicle. But she's not in it for the money, she said.\n\n'It's about getting out there and trying to make a difference to the wildlife that we find,' she said.\n\nKalil wore camouflage pants and rain boots. A slender woman, she hoped the Velcro wrapped around a wooden stick from Venezuela used to herd cattle would give her an edge.\n\n'Maybe he'll grab a hold of that and get stuck,' she said. 'And then I could grab him.'\n\nKalil would then hit the snake over the head and stab it in the brain, as if she were spearfishing.\n\nReliving a childhood playing in the woods\n\nShe walked over sunbaked rocks, crouched and crawled through hardwood hammocks. She poked the brush and thrusted the stick in holes in tree trunks.\n\nShe marveled at a black swallowtail butterfly and an endangered American crocodile in brackish water.\n\n'This is reliving my childhood. I used to live in the woods as a kid,' she said. 'After school, I'd just come and climb through the hardwood hammock. This is my favorite ecosystem.'\n\nKalil grew up in northern Miami in a family of Air Force veterans. She admired her brothers -- 'all-out boys, running around trying to catch stuff' -- and wanted to be like them, she said.\n\nShe recalled playing with their venomous tigra mariposa as a child when her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela. Her panicked nanny saw her with the reptile and pummeled the snake.\n\n'The image is, unfortunately, seared in my memory. I felt sorry for the little guys since then,' she said.\n\nHer brothers taught her how to hunt snakes, and she has been hunting them since.\n\nKalil kept pet snakes, too, and once had a boa constrictor.\n\n'Go get a snake'\n\nRecently, Kalil took part in the python challenges, bringing family and friends to hunt with her. She found a dead python each time -- a 9-foot one and then a 10-foot snake with its head chewed off.\n\nShe barbecued one, and had purses, wallets and key chains made from the skin. She had the python bone attached to existing snake-shaped earrings. It was a good luck charm. But more than two hours into Thursday's hunt -- even with the earrings -- she hadn't found any pythons. Neither had most hunters.\n\nThe mild temperatures at night, and the wind and lack of humidity, weren't ideal conditions.\n\nTom Rahill, founder of the Swamp Apes veterans support group, takes a break during the hunt.\n\n'It's always a good day to be out in the Everglades. However, it's a better day to be out there getting pythons,' said Tom Rahill, founder of the Florida-based Swamp Apes, an organization dedicated to taking veterans out on wilderness adventures to help them transition to civilian life.\n\nRahill said he has captured 400 pythons; he struck out on Thursday, too.\n\nBut he serenaded Kalil with a baritone pick-me-up tune.\n\n'Oh, Donna is amazing. Oh, Donna's a friend of mine. Go get a snake,' he sang.\n\n'You can do it. You can do it,' Rahill said.\n\n'Look on the bright side'\n\nTwo days earlier, a Swamp Apes member killed three pythons. One measured nearly 13 feet long.\n\nEncouraged, Kalil set off again after Rahill's song. But after about an hour, she came up empty.\n\nShe didn't want to stop. 'Got the python fever, I guess,' she said before wrapping up.\n\nShe didn't worry about prolonging the inevitable: killing her first snake.\n\n'I live in the moment. When it comes and I have to do it, I'm sure I'll have an issue with it,' she said.\n\nBut she said she'll save the life of another animal with every python kill.\n\nAnd maybe that's how she will get over it, she said.\n\n'Look on the bright side,' she said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that pythons eat vegetation.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/01/us/florida-burmese-python-hunt/index.html","1491019200.0"
"All New Volvo Models Will Be Electric Or Hybrid Starting In 2019\nAll New Volvo Models Will Be Electric Or Hybrid Starting In 2019\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jonas Ekstromer/AFP/Getty Images Jonas Ekstromer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVolvo has announced that starting in 2019, all of the new models it produces will be electric or hybrid.\n\n'This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,' said Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo president and chief executive, in a statement. 'Volvo Cars has stated that it plans to have sold a total of 1 million electrified cars by 2025. When we said it we meant it. This is how we are going to do it.'\n\nThe move makes Volvo the first traditional automaker to set a date to phase out cars powered only by internal combustion engines, Reuters reports.\n\nThe company said it will launch five fully electric cars between 2019 and 2021. Three of these will be Volvos, and two will be sold under the company's Polestar 'electrified performance brand.'\n\n'This is about the customer,' Samuelsson's statement said. 'People increasingly demand electrified cars and we want to respond to our customers' current and future needs.'\n\nWhile all of its new car lines will be 'electrified' starting in 2019, for a few years Volvo will continue production of existing models that don't have electric motors.\n\nIn addition to meeting customer demand, the move to electric will help the company reduce its carbon footprint and improve air quality, Samuelsson said.\n\nVolvo's announcement comes the same week that Tesla rolls out its Model 3 electric car, which at $35,000 costs roughly half the starting price of its other sedan, the Model S.\n\nIn a press conference in Stockholm on Wednesday, Samuelsson called Tesla 'a tough competitor,' and said that with this decision, 'we are really becoming the second premium carmaker in the world which will be ... also electrified.'\n\nLast week BMW announced it would introduce an all-electric version of its 3-Series line of cars, in what could be an attempt to compete with Tesla's Model 3.\n\nFord sold Volvo to the Chinese car company Geely for $1.8 billion in 2010. Volvo, founded in 1927, said that production of its new electric cars would be worldwide, beginning in China and followed by Europe and its new factory in the United States. The company said it had not yet chosen a battery supplier, and urged more development and competition in the battery industry.\n\nElectric cars and hybrids still make up a small portion of new cars bought, but at the high end where Tesla and Volvo operate, such cars have been making inroads, Reuters reports. Many in the industry expect a broader range of buyers to increasingly choose electric cars, the news service reports.\n\nSamuelsson emphasized that Volvo would be selling in the premium market. China leads the world in electric car sales, the Financial Times reports, with 265,000 sold there last year. Samuelsson noted that while China makes up a large part of the market, many of the electric cars sold there are lower-priced models.\n\nVolvo posted record sales last year, the Associated Press reports: 534,332 cars in 100 countries, a more than 6 percent increase over 2015.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/05/535596277/all-new-volvo-models-will-be-electric-or-hybrid-starting-in-2019","1499227200.0"
"I'm the descendant of a founding father and I have two black daughters — and I am racist\n\n\n(Rachel Orr/The Washington Post; iStock)\n\nAbout US is a new initiative by The Washington Post to cover issues of identity in the United States. Look for the About US newsletter launching this winter.\n\nI am the co-owner of a successful business with clients across the U.S. and in 27 countries. We have a racially diverse staff of 22. Over the years I have supported efforts to improve the conditions of “underserved” blacks. And I think it’s fair to say that, while I see the color of a person’s skin, I am able to get beyond it. I am a white man but I attended an integrated junior high school, dated across the race line, and two of my four adopted children are black. There is a good chance my two beautiful daughters will one day bless me with black grandchildren.\n\nAnd I am racist.\n\nRacism, I recently came to understand, isn’t about me having some kind of hate in my heart for black people in general, nor is it about me believing that the failures of individual black people in our society are because they are morally or intellectually inferior. Racism is more than individual beliefs and actions. It is a complex system that has given — and continues to give — my racial group a host of advantages and power by oppressing and disadvantaging others. Understanding and confronting that system begins with a history lesson and some simple math.\n\n[His grandfather was a slave. Now he’s a vocal champion for Confederate monuments.]\n\nI received that history lesson over the course of a two-day workshop in New Orleans that I attended to better understand disparities. My company’s clients, public sector and nonprofit agencies, have increasingly put disparities at the center of any serious efforts to improve outcomes for children and families. And, perhaps because of the recent presidential election, we are seeing both an increasing sense of urgency and greater willingness to discuss racism and white privilege.\n\nWhat I can tell you now is that what most whites learned about American history in school was not the whole story. For example, somehow, I have managed to live for 63 years without knowing that the concept of a white race developed in the 1600s, around the time that wealthy landowners in the American colonies began to transition from relying on the labor of poor indentured servants from Europe and Africa to owning black slaves and employing poor whites.\n\nThe simple math is about wealth accumulation. “Colorblind” policies cannot level today’s playing field because they cannot overcome the 300-year head start given to one group in all the advantages society had to offer for wealth accumulation. Imagine playing a game of monopoly but you only get to start after the other players have been at it for three hours. When you join the game, everyone still plays by the same rules. Does that sound fair?\n\n[From Jimi Hendrix to Colin Kaepernick: Why black Americans’ patriotism often looks like protest]\n\nThese lessons are particularly pointed for me because of my family history. In 1759, my great, great, great, great-grandfather Richard Henry Lee, in his first speech as a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, spoke in favor of a motion to “lay so heavy a duty upon the importation of slaves as effectually to put an end to that iniquitous and disgraceful traffic within the colony of Virginia.” Actually, many landowners in Virginia fretted about the morality and the long-term economic viability of slavery. Like those other landowners, Richard Henry Lee inherited slaves: 43 human souls to be exact. And, when cash was tight, he engaged in “that iniquitous and disgraceful traffic” — selling them to other slaveholders. When criticized by his brother for doing so, he responded, “You should know in general I have always thought the trade bad,” adding, “but since it will be carried on, I do not see how I could in justice to my family refuse any advantage that might arise from the selling of them.”\n\nThat’s all that most whites have done. We have done justice to our families by taking the advantages offered to us by society. The only fly in the ointment is that the same advantages have not been available to people of color because they are based on the continuation of a manufactured and inherently unjust racial system. The mass incarceration of people of color and abject urban poverty and blight are not natural disasters; rather, they are the result of systems doing exactly what they were designed to do.\n\nMany blacks and activists have, of course, been making these points for a long, long time. And I can only imagine how exasperating it must be to watch the rest of the United States slowly and hesitantly come to these realizations — while some continue to resist them completely. Over the course of the last year, I have been engaged in an ongoing conversation about race with a friend I play basketball with. He is black. His father, a doctor, taught him — as he, an engineer, is teaching his sons — that whenever he gets into a car he should put his wallet on the dashboard so that if he is pulled over by the police he will not have to put his hand into his pocket. He explained to me, “Phil, the difference between you and me when it comes to the issue of race in America is that you can pick it up and put it down as you like. I can’t.” Clearly, this isn’t just a history lesson. It’s also current events.\n\nAt the end of Ava DuVernay’s documentary “13th,” lawyer and activist Bryan Stevenson says that we all ask ourselves how people could have gone along with slavery, but we don’t ask ourselves today how we can go along with the mass incarceration of blacks.\n\n[‘I am American right now’: Russian immigrants split over rising hostilities with their native country]\n\nAnother colleague said to me recently, the best way for white men to perpetuate racism is to keep doing exactly what they’re doing, myself included. Reaping the benefits of an inherently racist system without doing anything to change it is itself racist. It’s time for a change. It started with a history lesson and some simple math. But it cannot stop there.\n\nWhat am I going to do? I am going to continue my own education so that I can help to change the pervasive narrative in our country that allows white men in good conscience to keep doing exactly what they’re doing. I am going to make available in my community the history lesson I received in New Orleans by hosting the same two-day workshop every month for at least a year and recruiting leaders — whites and people of color — to attend. I am going to invite everyone in my company to attend the workshop and we will apply what we learn to how we run our company — how we hire, promote, and engage staff — and how we serve our clients as they work to reduce disparities. And, because much of my own work concerns health care and biomedical research, I am going to join in the movement to eliminate health disparities nationally.\n\nFinally, I am going to encourage other white men to share their stories. And I am going to tell my good friend from basketball that I will no longer be picking up and putting down the issue of racism and the cause of equity. From here on out, it’s a full-court press.\n\nPhil Lee was born and raised in Silver Spring, Md., and is the president of Clear Impact.

"Zapad: What can we learn from Russia's latest military exercise?\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption What did the joint Belarus-Russian Zapad exercises reveal about President Putin's military strategy?\n\nFor all the Western concern about Russia's Zapad military exercises, they nonetheless offer a rare insight into developments in the Russian military at a time of significant change.\n\nAs one of the leading Western analysts of Russian military developments, Roger McDermott, says, 'while Russia's armed forces' leadership remain very interested in military theory, they test and rehearse new approaches to warfare in strategic exercises'.\n\nThus, he adds, 'exercises like Zapad offer glimpses into the real level of capability and demand careful and sober assessment for outsiders'.\n\nRussia claims this exercise falls below a treaty threshold of 13,000 soldiers that would require invitations to be issued to observer teams from other European nations. Western analysts place the numbers involved much higher.\n\nBut even without full-scale observer teams, Zapad is being monitored closely by Nato countries using satellites and aircraft with radars that can reach into western Russia to get a clear sense of how Russian and Belarussian forces perform.\n\nThese exercises come at an interesting moment.\n\nThe Russian military is transitioning from the old Cold-War-style Red Army into a more modern and flexible force, capable of conducting combined operations across land, sea and air, tailored to a variety of potential scenarios - just like the more sophisticated of Nato armies.\n\nLessons learned?\n\nIgor Sutyagin, the senior research fellow for Russian studies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) think tank in London, describes this as an attempt to create 'a lean, fully manned, combat-ready force, fully - or to the best possible extent - equipped with the up-to-date equipment [and] supported by agile rear infrastructure'.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Russia insists that the Zapad exercise involves fewer than 13,000 soldiers, the threshold for triggering the need for international observers\n\nDespite Russia's victory in the brief Georgia war of 2008, the conflict showed up many shortcomings. And Western analysts will be watching the Zapad manoeuvres closely to see how the Russian General Staff is applying the lessons learned from more recent operations in Syria and eastern Ukraine.\n\nDr Sutyagin told me: 'Both campaigns showed the general direction in which the Russian military is moving.'\n\nBut how far has Russia's military transition really gone? And, crucially, will the Russian government continue to have sufficient funds to maintain its military modernisation plans?\n\nTechnological gap?\n\nDr Sutyagin says the transition has passed the middle of its long path, with organisational changes nearing their completion.\n\nHowever, there have been some indications of backsliding, with a return to the establishment of large army divisions which, he says, are 'hard to man, thus being to a large extent 'empty shells''.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The Armata is a highly automated tank replacing much of Russia's Soviet-era armour\n\nRearmament with modern weaponry, necessary to close - or at the minimum, narrow - the technological gap between the Russian and the best Western military forces is also gaining momentum.\n\nBut Dr Sutyagin says much of the new equipment budget may now be in question, 'as completion of the rearmament programme depends on both availability of finances and access to Western technologies, which is becoming harder'.\n\nSpectacular fire power\n\nIn terms of the Zapad exercises themselves, there is much to look for.\n\nIn theory these are defensive exercises, organising the defence of Russia and Belarus against an external attack.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Russia used the Zapad exercises to showcase its Iskander-M missile\n\nThis of course has not prevented some spectacular firepower demonstrations, not least the firing of an Iskander-M missile from a range in south-west Russia against a mock target in Kazakhstan - a flight of some 480km (300 miles).\n\nBut in terms of the exercises themselves, what will Nato watchers be looking for?\n\nMr McDermott says 'it will be worth examining the use of strike systems in the exercise' because 'since the last Zapad in 2013, Moscow has magnified the role of conventional precision strike in its set of coercive tools'.\n\nIn a ground-breaking study of Russia's use of what it calls 'high-precision weapons' (precision-guided munitions or PGMs in the West) recently published by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Mr McDermott and his co-author, Tor Bukkvoll, set out the history and development of Russia's interest in this category of weapon.\n\nLong-range cruise missiles, both air- and sea-launched, were first used by the Russians in combat in the conflict in Syria.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Su-24 bombers at Hmeimim airbase: Russia sent dozens of warplanes to help President Assad's forces\n\nIt is interesting that while much of the Western media discussion of PGMs rests upon their use as air-launched weapons in bombing campaigns, intended to increase accuracy and reduce the level of civilian casualties, in Russia the weapons are viewed in a rather different light.\n\nMr McDermott's study concludes that 'for the foreseeable future, precision-guided munitions will mainly provide Russia with what in the Russian literature is called a 'pre-nuclear' deterrence capability'.\n\nElectronic warfare\n\nNote the Iskander-M launch in this exercise. This is basically just another layer of deterrence in addition to the nuclear weapons, but is still seen as being of vital importance by the Russian military.\n\nAnother area Mr McDermott highlights is Russia's growing electronic warfare (EW) capability.\n\nThis has been on display during the fighting in eastern Ukraine and has impressed many Nato commanders.\n\nThey fear that while their forces have had a lengthy gap in serious training for high-intensity conflict to fight counter-insurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia has been steadily improving its forces. EW is a case in point.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Nato countries are keen to deter any Russian move west\n\nIn a recently published study for the International Centre for Defence and Security in Estonia, Mr McDermott said: 'Russia's growing technological advances in EW will allow its forces to jam, disrupt and interfere with Nato communications, radar and other sensor systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and other assets.'\n\nThis capability, he said, risked 'negating advantages conferred on [Nato] by its technological edge'.\n\n'Many of those systems,' he said, 'are being introduced in units across all services stationed in Russia's Western Military District adjacent to Nato's borders.'\n\nRussia sees EW as a seamless whole, ranging from kinetic combat operations on the battlefield to missions in cyber-space and the information domain.\n\nIndeed this may be the area where the Russian military is breaking the 'newest' ground, having as it does, a far less clearly defined sense of the boundary line between war and peace.\n\nIt is in this 'grey area' of warfare that Moscow is leveraging its abilities.\n\nAs such it poses fundamental political and military challenges to Nato countries, in whose strategic outlook war and peace tend to assume a far more black and white character.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41309290","None"
"Saudi Blockade of Yemen Threatens to Starve Millions, U.N. Says\nMr. Lowcock said the Saudis must immediately allow the entry of food and medicine at all seaports, permit the immediate resumption of air services to the cities of Sana and Aden, and provide an “assurance of no further disruption to these services.”\n\nWithout such steps, he said, Yemen will suffer “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.”\n\nPhoto\n\nThe World Food Program, the anti-hunger agency of the United Nations, which has been feeding seven million people a month in Yemen, is now unable to do so, Mr. Lowcock said. “What we need is a winding down of the blockade to save the lives of those people.”\n\nThe Security Council, which has condemned the missile launching into Saudi territory, took no immediate action regarding the blockade. Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi of Italy, the Council’s president for November, said members called on all parties in Yemen to “provide unhindered access for humanitarian supplies,” a reiteration of the Council’s position.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, 15 humanitarian relief groups expressed alarm in a joint statement that the blockade had imperiled lifesaving assistance to millions of people in Yemen.\n\nThe country is struggling with an acute hunger crisis that has affected at least 17 million people, more than a third of them considered close to famine. Yemen also suffering a cholera scourge that has sickened nearly one million.\n\nPhoto\n\n“Given the current acute food-security crisis and cholera epidemic, any delays to the restoration and expansion of humanitarian access will cost the lives of women, men, girls and boys across the whole of Yemen,” the statement by the aid groups said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey warned that “in the absence of clarity and detail from the coalition, worrying questions remain about the extent and duration of these measures and their expected impact on the civilian population.”\n\nWithout a quick end to the blockade, they said, “we fear an already catastrophic humanitarian and economic crisis will get substantially worse.”\n\nThe signers included some of the most prominent international aid groups, including the International Rescue Committee, Oxfam and Save the Children.\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross pleaded with the Saudi-led coalition to allow Yemeni ports to continue receiving medical supplies, including chlorine tablets used to prevent cholera.\n\n“Humanitarian supply lines to Yemen must remain open,” said Robert Mardini, the Red Cross’s regional director for the Near and Middle East. “Food, medicine and other essential supplies are critical for the survival of 27 million Yemenis already weakened by a conflict now in its third year.”\n\nSaudi Arabia has described the blockade as necessary to prevent the Houthis, who are from Yemen’s north, and their allies from smuggling military weaponry into the country.\n\nThe Saudis have accused Iran of delivering the type of missile to the Houthis that was launched at Saudi Arabia on Saturday, which traveled more than 500 miles before Saudi air defenses shot it down it near Riyadh, the capital. Iran, Saudi Arabia’s main rival in the Middle East, has denied the accusation.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-blockade.html","1510117200.0"
"Surfs up! 5 of Africa's best surfing spots\n(CNN) A recent study estimates the global surfing industry pulls in around $50 billion dollars a year, and some African countries are keen to tap into this economic growth.\n\nAlthough the surfing industry on the continent is still relatively young, with a coastline of over 19,000 miles , it has the potential to become the world's next top surfing destination.\n\nAfrica's surf spots have become an attraction to surfers who desire less crowded waves, with South Africa leading the charge.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nWith a variety of waves and a relatively developed surf culture, South Africa is a huge attraction for surf tourists around the world.\n\nOne of its many surf spots, Jeffery's Bay, is ranked as one of the top 10 surfing spots in the world with a swell consistency of 96% and an average swell height of 12ft\n\nJUST WATCHED Catching waves with top-ranked African surfer Replay More Videos ...

The country has a reputation of having the world's third highest shark attack rate with a total of 790 incidents since 1900.\n\nGhana\n\nAlthough the surfing scene in Ghana is still relatively small, its uncrowded 550 kilometres of coastline, is an attraction to tourists around the world.\n\nThere are many surf spots in the country, however, the small fishing village of Busua, west of Takoradi, has slowly becoming the country's surfing capital. Surf camps, schools, shops and the likes are springing up across the village. Only a handful of surfers in Ghana are locals with most being tourists from around the world.\n\nIts swells range from two to six feet reaching its highest at eight feet typically around April to September.\n\nOther surf spots in Ghana like Dixcove, Takoradi, Mutrakni are relatively empty even though they boast of swell sizes of about three to five feet\n\nSenegal\n\nStudents of the Rip Curl Surf Club Ngor surf school walk on the Almadie beach on May 23, 2015 in Dakar.\n\nIn Sengal surf spots are uncrowded despite seeing north and west swells between two to 10 feet . Some of it's popular surf camps like N'gor and Malika surf camp make an average of $125,000 annually.\n\nThe geographic location of Dakar, Senegal exposes it to northern and southern hemisphere swells patterns, which ensures that the city sees decent waves all year round.\n\nPhotos: Surf's up! Catching waves in Dakar Surf's up! Catching waves in Dakar – Welcome to Dakar, the vibrant home of a growing community of surfers taking advantage of the warm weather, year-round waves and cheap flights. This city is fast becoming the go-to place for surf enthusiasts looking for an uncrowded beach to hone their craft. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Surf's up! Catching waves in Dakar Why Dakar? – Why Dakar?\n\n\n\nThe Senegalese capital is located on the Cape Verde Peninsula on the Atlantic coast. The temperate weather and waves from both the north and south make it the ideal spot for surf-loving locals and tourists.\n\nLooking for somewhere to learn the basics? There's a number of surfing schools and places to stay in Dakar, including the Malika Surf Camp and the N'Gor Island Senegal Surf Camp.\n\nMalika Surf Camp is named after the city where its owners met. Aziz Kane and Marta Imarisio met in Malika, a little village outside Dakar, and fell in love. They are now married with two children and between them they have been teaching tourists and locals how to surf on Yoff beach since 2009.\n\nAcross the water, Danish-born Jesper Mouritzen set up N'Gor Island Senegal Surf Camp after a visit to Senegal in 2006. He came to unwind with some friends but once he saw the huge waves and happy surfers he gave up his job managing hotel restaurants, and hasn't looked back since.\n\nHide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Surf's up! Catching waves in Dakar The waves – The waves\n\n\n\nUnlike the more popular surfing destinations on the continent, for example Morocco, in Dakar you can surf all year round.\n\n'In the winter we get all the swell from the north that passes from storms in the U.S. and Europe and in the summer we get swell from South Africa,' says Mouritzen. 'We have a swell window of 370 degrees and the water is very deep which creates perfect waves for us.'\n\n'You have a lot of waves close to each other and it's not crowded compared to Morocco or South Africa,' adds Marta.\n\nThe waves that these experts ride range between 2 and 10 ft., but there are classes for absolute beginners as well.\n\nHide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: Surf's up!

The availability of basic supplies hinders many locals who simply can't afford the equipment, and specialist items such as wax for the surfboards has to be rationed all year round.\n\nAs well as the lack of supplies, Ebola has affected trade this year in Dakar. Despite the fact that there has only been one confirmed case of Ebola, tourists are wary of traveling to Africa because of the seriousness of the disease across other areas.\n\n'We probably have 15% of the people we had last year,' said Mouritzen 'We've had no tourists at all.' Marta of Malika surf camp agrees; 'This year is quite strange because of the Ebola problem in West Africa. A lot of surfers and tourists in general didn't come. So this year it's quite quiet compared to last winter. Usually you see more people travelling in Senegal because the prices are getting cheaper.'\n\nHide Caption 5 of 5\n\nN'gor Island, one of its popular surf spots sees swell sizes of three to 5 feet with its highest at 16 feet and above.\n\nIt also has a swell window of 370 degrees which about 100 local and ex-pat surfers riding its waves every year.\n\nMorocco\n\nOver the years, Morocco has transformed to a surfing scene thanks to the influx of surfing tourists from around the world.\n\nTaghazout, Morocco its most popular surf spot has metamorphosed from the fishing village it used to be to become something of a surfer's mecca.\n\nMany tourists are attracted by its waves which go as high as 15 feet especially between October and March.\n\nThe country has over 300 days of sunshine a year and sees swell sizes of up to 15 feet in its winter months\n\nMozambique\n\nEmiliano Cataldi surfs in Angoche, Nampula Province, Mozambique.\n\nThe southern African nation of Mozambique has a coastline of over 2500km but its waves are relatively unexplored save for Imhambane and Ponto d'Ouro.\n\nThe country gets waves through out the year with peaks from June to August at wintertime and stable sea temperatures of 25-25°C all year round.\n\nSome of the more popular surf spots in the country are Barra beach, Guinjala Bay, Tofinho and Ponta d'Ouro.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/africa/surfing-destinations-africa/index.html","1507003200.0"
"From an Anchor’s Lips to Trump’s Ears to Sweden’s Disbelief\nThe Fox News segment featured an interview with Mr. Horowitz, whose short film, “Stockholm Syndrome,” depicted Sweden as a place where rape and violence have been on the rise since it began accepting more refugees from Muslim countries.\n\nIn the Fox interview, Mr. Horowitz acknowledged that most Swedes do not see the situation as he does. “They’ll make excuses for it,” he said. “The majority of the population in Sweden still wants to have an open-door policy. It’s confounding.”\n\nMr. Trump was clearly struck by the interview, and he cited Sweden at a rally in Melbourne, Fla., on Saturday as he argued for stronger borders. “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” he said. “Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”\n\nAides later said “last night” referred to the Fox program, not to an episode the night before. Mr. Carlson argued on Monday that although “the president ought to be precise in what he says, there should be no confusion about what he means.”\n\nMr. Carlson said that assimilation had failed and that immigration was “in the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much more threatening.”\n\nCritics of Sweden’s migration policies have pointed to a Facebook post on Feb. 3 by a police officer, Peter Springare, who said that migrants were taxing Sweden’s pension, education and health systems and that they were the principal culprits in assaults. “Half of the suspects we cannot even be sure of because they don’t have any valid papers,” he wrote. “Most often this means they are lying about their country of origin and identity.”\n\nBut the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Monday quoted two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom, as saying that the filmmaker had selectively edited and distorted their comments to prove his thesis. They said that Mr. Horowitz had asked them about high-crime neighborhoods and that they did not agree with his argument about links between migration and crime. “We don’t stand behind what he says,” Mr. Goranzon said. “He is a madman.”\n\nMr. Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment, but he went back on Mr. Carlson’s show on Monday night to defend his work, citing crime statistics and asserting that the police officers had recanted because they were under pressure. “My record stands for itself,” he said, “and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/europe/trump-pursues-his-attack-on-sweden-with-scant-evidence.html","1487566800.0"
"​Best intentions: When disaster relief brings anything but relief\nMany of the well-meaning articles we Americans donate in times of disaster turn out to be of no use to those in need. Sometimes, they even get in the way. That's a message relief organizations very much want us to heed. Our Cover Story is reported now by Scott Simon of NPR. (An earlier version of this story was originally broadcast on 'Sunday Morning' on April 24, 2016.)\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Harvey reminds us all over again that when Nature grows savage and angry, Americans can get generous and kind. That's admirable. It might also be a problem.\n\n'Generally after a disaster, people with loving intentions donate things that cannot be used in a disaster response, and in fact may actually be harmful,' said Juanita Rilling, former director of the Center for International Disaster Information in Washington, D.C. 'And they have no idea that they're doing it.'\n\nRilling has spent more than a decade trying to tell well-meaning people to think before they give.\n\nIn 1998 Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras. More than 11,000 people died. More than a million and a half were left homeless.\n\nAnd Rilling got a wake-up call: 'Got a call from one of our logistics experts who said that a plane full of supplies could not land, because there was clothing on the runway. It's in boxes and bales. It takes up yards of space. It can't be moved.' 'Whose clothing is it?' He said, 'Well, I don't know whose it is, but there's a high-heeled shoe, just one, and a bale of winter coats.' And I thought, winter coats? It's summer in Honduras.'\n\nHumanitarian workers call the crush of useless, often incomprehensible contributions 'the second disaster.'\n\nIn 2004, following the Indian Ocean tsunami, a beach in Indonesia was piled with used clothing.\n\nThere was no time for disaster workers to sort and clean old clothes. So the contributions just sat and rotted.\n\n'This very quickly went toxic and had to be destroyed,' said Rilling. 'And local officials poured gasoline on it and set it on fire. And then it was out to sea.'\n\nUSAID/OFDA\n\n'So, rather than clothing somebody, it went up in flames?' asked Simon.\n\n'Correct. The thinking is that these people have lost everything, so they must NEED everything. So people SEND everything. You know, any donation is crazy if it's not needed. People have donated prom gowns and wigs and tiger costumes and pumpkins, and frostbite cream to Rwanda, and used teabags, 'cause you can always get another cup of tea.'\n\nYou may not think that sending bottles of water to devastated people seems crazy. But Rilling points out, 'This water, it's about 100,000 liters, will provide drinking water for 40,000 people for one day. This amount of water to send from the United States, say, to West Africa -- and people did this -- costs about $300,000. But relief organizations with portable water purification units can produce the same amount, a 100,000 liters of water, for about $300.'\n\nAnd then there were warm-hearted American women who wanted to send their breast milk to nursing mothers in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.\n\n'It sounds wonderful, but in the midst of a crisis it's actually one of the most challenging things,' said Rebecca Gustafson, a humanitarian aid expert who has worked on the ground after many disasters.\n\n'Breast milk doesn't stay fresh for very long. And the challenge is, what happens if you do give it to an infant who then gets sick?'\n\nDecember 2012, Newtown, Connecticut: A gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Almost instantaneously, stuff start arriving.\n\nChris Kelsey\n\nChris Kelsey, who worked for Newtown at the time, said they had to get a warehouse to hold all the teddy bears.\n\nSimon asked, 'Was there a need for teddy bears?'\n\n'I think it was a nice gesture,' Kelsey replied. 'There was a need to do something for the kids. There was a need to make people feel better. I think the wave of stuff we got was a little overwhelming.'\n\nAnd how many teddy bear came to Newtown? 'I think it was about 67,000,' Kelsey said. 'Wasn't limited to teddy bears. There was also thousands of boxes of school supplies, and thousands of boxes of toys, bicycles, sleds, clothes.'\n\nNewtown had been struck by mass murder, not a tsunami. As Kelsey said, 'I think a lot of the stuff that came into the warehouse was more for the people that sent it, than it was for the people in Newtown. At least, that's the way it felt at the end.'\n\nEvery child in Newtown got a few bears. The rest had to be sent away, along with the bikes and blankets.\n\nThere are times when giving things works. More than 650,000 homes were destroyed or damaged in Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Thousands of people lost everything.\n\nHelpAfterSandy.org\n\nTammy Shapiro is one of the organizers of Occupy Sandy, which grew out of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\n'We were able to respond in a way that the big, bureaucratic agencies can't,' Shapiro said.\n\nWhen the hurricane struck, they had a network of activists, connected and waiting.\n\n'Very quickly, we just stopped taking clothes,' Shapiro said. Instead, they created a 'relief supply' wedding registry.\n\n'We put the items that we needed donated on that registry,' said Shapiro. 'And then people who wanted to donate could buy the items that were needed. I mean, a lot of what we had on the wedding registry was diapers. They needed flashlights.'\n\nSimon asked, 'How transportable is your experience here, following Hurricane Sandy?'\n\n'For me, the network is key. Who has the knowledge? Where are spaces that goods can live if there's a disaster? Who's really well-connected on their blocks?'\n\nJuanita Rilling's album of disaster images shows shot after shot of good intentions just spoiling in warehouses, or rotting on the landscape.\n\n'It is heartbreaking,' Rilling said. 'It's heartbreaking for the donor, it's heartbreaking for the relief organizations, and it's heartbreaking for survivors. This is why cash donations are so much more effective. They buy exactly what people need, when they need it.\n\n'And cash donations enable relief organizations to purchase supplies locally, which ensures that they're fresh and familiar to survivors, purchased in just the right quantities, and delivered quickly. And those local purchases support the local merchants, which strengthens the local economy for the long run.'\n\nDisaster response worker Rebecca Gustafson says that most people want to donate something that is theirs: 'Money sometimes doesn't feel personal enough for people. They don't feel enough of their heart and soul is in that donation, that check that they would send.\n\n'The reality is, it's one of the most compassionate things that people can do.'\n\nBelow: A PSA on disaster relief giving:\n\nFor more info:","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-intentions-when-disaster-relief-brings-anything-but-relief/","None"
"Myanmar treatment of Rohingya looks like 'textbook ethnic cleansing', says UN\nMyanmar’s treatment of its Muslim Rohingya minority appears to be a “textbook example” of ethnic cleansing, the top United Nations human rights official has said.\n\nIn an address to the UN human rights council in Geneva, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein denounced the “brutal security operation” against the Rohingya in Rakhine state, which he said was “clearly disproportionate” to insurgent attacks carried out last month.\n\nWho are the Rohingya and what is happening in Myanmar? Read more\n\nMore than 310,000 people have fled to Bangladesh in recent weeks, with more trapped on the border, amid reports of the burning of villages and extrajudicial killings.\n\n“I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred, and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,” Hussein said. “The situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”\n\nWith international pressure mounting on Monday, the country’s foreign affairs ministry – which is headed by the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi – said it shared global concerns at the displacement and suffering of “all communities” in the latest violence.\n\nThe statement failed to mention the Rohingya, who are not a recognised ethnic group in Myanmar, but listed other affected communities in Rakhine state, including other Muslim groups, whose fate it said was “sadly overlooked by the world”.\n\n\n\nIt added that the security forces had been instructed “to exercise all due restraint and to take full measures to avoid collateral damage and the harming of innocent civilians”.\n\nHuman rights violations and other crimes would be addressed “in accordance with the strict norms of justice”, it said.\n\nQ&A Why hasn't Aung San Suu Kyi condemned anti-Rohingya violence? Show Hide When Aung San Suu Kyi was elected to parliament in 2012 there were high hopes that the Nobel peace prize winner would help heal Myanmar's entrenched ethnic divides. Some defenders at the time tried to argue that she was gagged by temporary political concerns because she had to hold on to the votes of nationalist Buddhists. However, her NLD party won a landslide victory in elections in 2015 and yet she remained conspicuously silent.\n\nShe has defended the government that she is part of in response to the recent wave of violence, sparking further widespread condemnation.\n\nHer exact motivations remain opaque but the only thing she obviously stands to lose by speaking out is the support of the military power brokers who still ultimately control Myanmar. The only thing she could obviously hope to gain by her silence is more power and influence.\n\nRead more\n\nThe latest crackdown against the Muslim minority was triggered on 25 August when a Rohingya insurgent group attacked more than two dozen security sites and killed 12 people.\n\nMilitia groups, local security forces and the Burmese army responded with “clearance operations” that have forced refugees into Bangladesh and left tens of thousands more displaced inside the state.\n\n\n\nThe foreign ministry said the attacks were deliberately timed to sabotage the release of a report by the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan advising on ways to overcome the decades-old tension between the Rohingya and Myanmar’s leaders.\n\nAnnan’s report, which also did not name the Rohingya at Aung San Suu Kyi’s request, recommended that the government begin lifting longstanding restrictions on the community’s ability to participate in politics, move freely and gain citizenship.\n\nOn Sunday, Bangladesh’s foreign minister accused the Myanmar government of committing genocide against the Rohingya. Analysts said that AH Mahmood Ali’s language was the strongest yet from Myanmar’s neighbour, and reflected intense frustration in Dhaka at the continuing influx of Rohingya refugees.\n\nOver the weekend, the Dalai Lama became the latest Nobel peace prize laureate to speak out about the crisis, telling the Burmese forces involved in attacks on the ethnic Muslim minority to “remember Buddha”.\n\nAli told diplomats on Sunday that unofficial sources had put the Rohingya death toll from the latest unrest in Rakhine at about 3,000.\n\nMassacre at Tula Toli: Rohingya recall horror of Myanmar army attack Read more\n\n“The international community is saying it is a genocide. We also say it is a genocide,” Ali told reporters in Dhaka. He said the influx of refugees in the past month took the total number of Rohingya in Bangladesh to more than 700,000. “It is now a national problem.”\n\nAli said about 10,000 homes had been burned in Rakhine state, a figure that cannot be verified as Myanmar has restricted independent access to the state.\n\nIn Washington, Donald Trump’s administration broke its silence on the crisis on Monday, but White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not mention the Rohingya by name and appeared to blame the violence on both sides.\n\nSanders said: “The United States is deeply troubled by the ongoing crisis in Burma where at least 300,000 people have fled their homes in the wake of attacks on Burmese security posts on 25 August. We reiterate our condemnation of those attacks and the ensuing violence.”\n\nScores of refugees in Bangladesh have given accounts of arson by Burmese security forces. Human Rights Watch said on Sunday that satellite analysis had shown evidence of fire damage in urban areas populated by Rohingya as well as in isolated villages.\n\n\n\nMyanmar says it is targeting armed insurgents, including fighters from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa), the group which claimed responsibility for the August attacks and reportedly controls small areas of Rakhine.\n\nArsa, which has been accused of carrying out attacks against Buddhist and Hindu civilians, called for a month-long “humanitarian pause” on Sunday to deal with the refugee crisis. The truce was dismissed by Myanmar authorities, which said they did not negotiate with “terrorists”.\n\nThe International Organisation for Migration estimated about 313,000 Rohingya had crossed into Bangladesh by Monday, noting that the influx appeared to be slowing.

"NYC hospital shooter was looking for ex-colleague, sources say\nNew York (CNN) The gunman who killed a doctor and wounded six other people at a New York hospital was looking for a physician he blamed for his resignation from the facility, but that person wasn't there, law enforcement sources said on condition of anonymity Saturday.\n\nAnd the slain doctor, Tracy Sin Yee Tam, 32, was on Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center's 17th floor Friday afternoon only because she was covering for a colleague who needed time off, a hospital official said.\n\n'Yesterday she was asked to cover one of the physicians who was out, and so she was on that floor at that time,' Dr. Sridhar Chilimuri, the hospital's physician in chief, told reporters Saturday.\n\nThe gunman, who police say killed himself after the shooting spree, was Dr. Henry Bello, a former Bronx-Lebanon physician, two law enforcement officials said.\n\nThe shooter was a 'disgruntled' ex-employee who worked there from August 2014 to February 2015 and resigned before he was to be fired, hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said.\n\nMotive in shooting is unclear\n\nSo far authorities have not offered a motive.\n\nBut a three-paragraph letter emailed to a newspaper might yield some clues, though it gave no indication the writer might be violent.\n\nJUST WATCHED Man hides in hospital room during shooting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Man hides in hospital room during shooting 00:38\n\nA man identifying himself as Henry Bello sent an email to the New York Daily News two hours before the shooting.\n\nIn the email the man writes about being terminated from Bronx-Lebanon and complains that several doctors worked to get him fired.\n\nThe email mentions two doctors, a man and a woman, whom he blames for his dismissal.\n\nThe man says he wrote a letter to the female doctor 'congratulating her for my termination' and saying he told her 'it remains to be seen if my life is meaningless or disposable.'\n\nThe newspaper said the man's email was read after the shooting.\n\n'Once we verified that it was the same man responsible for the shooting, the decision was made to publish the letter in full with the redaction of the names,' said Zach Haberman, the newspaper's head of content.\n\n'At no point was there any indication of violence against anyone which can be clearly seen in the letter that we published.'\n\nPolice said the letter will be part of the investigation.\n\n'Why didn't you help me?'\n\nInvestigators are trying to determine how the gunman got past security and onto the 16th and 17th floors of the 972-bed facility, but he was wearing a white lab coat and carrying identification, New York police Commissioner James O'Neill said.\n\nPolice vehicles converge on Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center after Friday's shooting.\n\nBello, carrying an assault rifle, saw a doctor on the 16th floor and yelled, 'Why didn't you help me when I was getting in trouble?' a law enforcement source said.\n\nHe fired, missing the doctor but hitting others standing at a nurses' station, the source said.\n\nThe shooter took out a container of flammable liquid, poured it on the floor and then ignited it, law enforcement sources said.\n\nHe then climbed stairs to the 17th floor and shot two physicians, including the woman who died, before fatally shooting himself in the chest, the sources said.\n\nBello fired eight times, and had 10 bullets in his pocket, according to the sources.\n\nThe slain physician was well-liked and had been there for about a year, said Schneer, the hospital spokesman.\n\nThe doctor who had taken Friday off is 'totally grief-stricken' and spending time with the slain victim's family, Schneer said.\n\nGunman reportedly belligerent as colleague\n\nHospital officials have said little publicly about the gunman.\n\nA post shared by Angela Bonilla (@hollywood_kitty) on Jun 30, 2017 at 12:35pm PDT\n\nBut the doctor whom Bello is believed to have sought Friday told investigators that Bello, when he worked at Bronx-Lebanon, was belligerent and difficult to work with, and got into disputes with nurses and other staffers, law enforcement sources said.\n\nFriday's shooter resigned 'in lieu of termination' in February 2015, said Schneer, who didn't explain say why he faced termination.\n\nHospital officials were unhappy with the shooter's performance, and he left under 'unfortunate circumstances,' said Chilimuri, the chief physician.\n\nThe gunman used to work on the 16th floor, said Chilimuri, who said the floor typically tended to stable admitted patients with active medical problems.\n\nOne in critical condition\n\nOf the wounded, one is a Bronx-Lebanon patient; three are doctors; and two are medical students, Chilimuri said. Their names weren't released.\n\nOne of them, a doctor, remains in critical condition Saturday, with brain and knee injuries, Chilimuri said.\n\nThe other victims were stable Saturday morning, according to Chilimuri:\n\n• A doctor shot in the hand was undergoing extensive surgery; he's expected to recover most of the hand's function.\n\n• A doctor shot in the neck is expected to recover fully.\n\n• A doctor shot in the abdomen has been taken off a ventilator.\n\n• A wounded man is expected to be transferred to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital for further surgery.\n\n• The hospital patient had a minor injury and soon will be released.\n\nHelping the wounded: 'We carried him nine floors'\n\nVideo from the scene showed employees and others coming out of the hospital's main entrance, their hands in the air, and crossing the street toward waiting police officers.\n\nHospital employee Gonzalo Corazo said he was at work when the shooting started just before 3 p.m. ET Friday.\n\n'That's when I panicked and then all of sudden my first instinct was the patients, taking care of the patients,' Corazo told CNN affiliate WABC-TV.\n\nAmbulance EMT Robert Maldonado told the TV station that he and others locked themselves in a room and waited. When they heard someone yell for an EMT, they jumped into action to help a doctor with a gunshot wound in his stomach.\n\n'He was in a lot of pain, obviously,' Maldonado told WABC.\n\n'We carried him nine floors. The police department helped carry, I helped put pressure on the wound, the entrance and exit wound, and the police department, they all just grabbed his legs, grabbed his arms.'\n\nBecause the gunman started a fire, the hospital's fire suppression system activated, dousing the floor with water. The hospital's 15th, 16th and 17th floors were closed Saturday for cleanup and the investigation.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/01/us/new-york-hospital-shooting/index.html","1498881600.0"
"Ex-officer acquitted in St. Louis slaying: 'I did nothing wrong'\nJason Stockley, the former St. Louis police officer who was acquitted of murder Friday in the 2011 fatal shooting of a black man, broke his months-long silence and doubled down on his innocence after the ruling.\n\n“I did not murder Anthony Lamar Smith. I did not plant a gun,” Stockley said, shaking his head, in an exclusive interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch after his acquittal. “… I can feel for and I understand what the family is going through, and I know everyone wants someone to blame, but I’m just not the guy.”\n\nThe interview, which appeared to be videotaped in a private indoor space, came hours after a judge released a 30-page order concluding as much: that the state had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Stockley “did not act in self-defense” when he shot and killed Smith, 24, during a car chase in December 2011.\n\nIt was the first time Stockley, who had been under a gag order, publicly addressed the case, which has exacerbated tensions in a region already grappling with unrest surrounding police use of force and race.\n\n[Police and protesters clash in St. Louis after former officer acquitted on murder charges]\n\n“It feels like a burden has been lifted, but the burden of having to kill someone never really lifts,” Stockley told the Post-Dispatch. “The taking of a life is the most significant thing that one can do, and it’s not something that is done lightly and it’s not something that should ever be celebrated. And it’s just a horrible experience altogether. But, sometimes, it’s necessary.”\n\nAs in trial, Stockley insisted that he did not recall saying during the car chase that he was “going to kill this motherf—er, don’t you know it,” as outlined in court documents. Prosecutors also noted that a gun found in Smith’s car was later found to contain only Stockley’s DNA and accused the officer of planting the firearm.\n\nStockley said that his memory was imperfect and that the first time he heard himself saying what he did in the car was when he met with the FBI; he could only speculate as to why he had said it, “whether it was in the heat of the moment or whether it was part of a larger conversation,” he said.\n\n“I can tell you with absolute certainty that there was no plan to murder Anthony Smith during a high-speed vehicle pursuit,” Stockley told the newspaper. “It’s just not the case.”\n\nStockley acknowledged in his interview that the “optics” of the case looked bad but said he had made the best decisions possible “based on limited information and a limited amount of time.”\n\n“Every resisting looks bad. They never look good,” Stockley told the Post-Dispatch. “So what you have to separate are the optics from the facts, and if a person is unwilling to do that, then they’ve already made up their mind and the facts just don’t matter. To those people, there’s nothing that I can do to change their minds.”\n\n[The Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings this year]\n\nStockley declined an interview request Saturday through his attorney, Neil J. Bruntrager, who told The Washington Post that his client’s conversation with the Post-Dispatch was likely a “one and done” situation. The trial, he said, had left Stockley emotionally exhausted.\n\n“All you’re doing is reading these articles and statements from people who are ill-informed and demonizing you, and you have no ability to respond,” Bruntrager said. “Think what that must be like. … I don’t know how the top of his head didn’t blow off.”\n\nAs general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, Bruntrager also represented Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager, in Ferguson, Mo., a St. Louis suburb. He emphasized, however, that Stockley’s case preceded the Brown shooting by several years and needed to be considered individually.\n\n“It’s important to look at the video, but that’s not all of the evidence … I would encourage people to read Judge [Timothy] Wilson’s opinion because here’s a detailed examination of the facts of the case, and it leaves no stone unturned,” Bruntrager said. “This wasn’t a routine traffic stop. This was a drug-related stop. Those by their very nature — they’re deadly.”\n\n[U2 cancels St. Louis concert amid protests]\n\nThe judge’s ruling Friday prompted protests in St. Louis, which began peacefully but, after nightfall, turned violent, according to a joint video statement by St. Louis Police Chief Lawrence O’Toole and Mayor Lyda Krewson. The clashes resulted in at least 23 arrests and 10 injured police officers, O’Toole said. Even before the acquittal, the city was bracing for protests, as The Post reported:\n\nOn Friday night, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R), who had put the state’s National Guard on standby ahead of the verdict and potential protests, chastised those who engaged in violence, saying it “is not going to be tolerated here in the state of Missouri.” Before the verdict was announced, Greitens stood with Christina Wilson, Smith’s fiancee, to deliver a joint message asking people to protest peacefully. “If you feel like you want to speak out, speak how you feel,” Wilson said at the news briefing. “And whatever comes to you, just do it in a peaceful way.” Greitens, speaking after Wilson, urged people who felt pain after the verdict not to “turn that pain into violence.” “One life has been lost in this case, and we don’t need more bloodshed,” he said.\n\nIn his interview with the Post-Dispatch, Stockley said he was concerned the ensuing protests would escalate to violence.\n\n“My main concern now is for the first responders, the people just trying to go to work and the protesters,” Stockley told the newspaper. “I don’t want anyone to be hurt in any way over this.”\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Stockley left the St. Louis police force in 2013 and moved to Houston, where he worked as a regional project manager at TH Hill Associates, an oil and gas drilling consulting firm. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 2002 with degrees in philosophy and nuclear engineering; afterward, Stockley served in the Army in Iraq, where he received a bronze star, and was honorably discharged after an injury, Bruntrager said.\n\nStockley told the Post-Dispatch on Friday that he had been apart from his family and had no plan besides “not to let this dictate my life.” When asked what he might have done differently on that day in December 2011, he responded: “Take the day off.”\n\n“I don’t know how changing any number of my actions that day would have changed the outcome,” he told the newspaper. There was one main reason he had agreed to speak about the case.\n\n“Because I didn’t do anything wrong,” he said. “If you’re telling the truth, and you’ve been wrongfully accused, you should be shouting it from a mountaintop.”\n\nRead more:\n\nA cop stopped a car for speeding — then pointed a gun at a passenger for more than 9 minutes\n\nTeen girl files claim against police who mistook her for a black male suspect and punched her\n\nA Utah nurse’s violent arrest puts patient-consent law — and police conduct — in the spotlight","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/16/ex-officer-acquitted-in-st-louis-slaying-i-did-nothing-wrong/","1505534400.0"
"Britain to Ban New Diesel and Gas Cars by 2040\nLONDON — Scrambling to combat a growing air pollution crisis, Britain announced on Wednesday that sales of new diesel and gas cars would reach the end of the road by 2040, the latest step in Europe’s battle against the damaging environmental impact of the internal combustion engine.\n\nBritain’s plans match a similar pledge made this month by France, and are part of a growing global push to curb emissions and fight climate change by promoting electric cars. Carmakers are also adjusting, with Volvo notably saying recently that it would phase out the internal combustion engine in the coming years and BMW deciding to build an electric version of its popular Mini car in Britain.\n\nBut the shift to electric vehicles will be a gradual one, and the target set by Britain is less ambitious than some of the efforts elsewhere. President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord has also dented optimism.\n\nBritain’s new clean air strategy, published on Wednesday, calls for sales of new gas and diesel cars and vans to end by 2040. The government will also make 255 million pounds, or $332 million, available for local governments to take short-term action, such as retrofitting buses, to reduce air pollution.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/world/europe/uk-diesel-petrol-emissions.html","1501041600.0"
"5 'terrorists' dead in Spain police shootout after attacks that killed 14, injured 100\nFive alleged terrorists were killed in a shootout with police in Spain's Catalonia region early Friday following deadly attacks there that killed at least 14 people and injured more than 100 others, according to Spanish authorities.\n\nInterested in Spain? Add Spain as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Spain news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAmong the victims who died is an American citizen, the U.S. Department of State said Friday. Jared Tucker died in the attack in Barcelona, his family confirmed.\n\nSpanish officials announced Friday evening that they have identified the nationalities of seven more victims from the attacks. In the Barcelona attack, one Italian victim, one Portuguese victim, and four Spaniards -- one with dual Argentinian citizenship -- were killed, officials in Spain said. In Cambrils, one Spaniard was killed, Catalan Emergency Services said.\n\nThe Italian Foreign Ministry has also named three Italians among the victims of the Barcelona attack. The Prime Minister tweeted on Friday about the two who lived in Italy, and the Foreign Minister has called their families. The victims were: Bruno Gulotta, 35 years old from Legnano; Luca Russo, 25 years old from Bassano del Grappa; and Carmen Lopardo, an Italian-Argentinian. It is unclear where Loprado resided.\n\nAll five of the people who were killed in Cambrils overnight have been identified, police said, but they would not confirmed if the alleged driver of the van used in the Barcelona attack was among those killed in Cambrils.\n\nCatalan police said the alleged terrorists, who wore fake suicide vests and were armed with knives, were killed in the coastal town of Cambrils early Friday after striking pedestrians and police there with an Audi A3. Four people, including a police officer, were injured in the vehicle-ramming attack and one civilian, a woman, was killed, according to Catalonia's emergency services.\n\nAnother 13 people were killed in Barcelona on Thursday when a white van mowed down a crowd of pedestrians along the city's famous La Rambla boulevard, a popular tourist destination that was packed with people at the time. At least 100 others were injured, according to police.\n\nAs of Saturday, a total of 53 victims from the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils remain hospitalized, including 13 in critical condition and 22 in serious condition, according to Catalonia's Civil Protection Office.\n\nAt a press conference Saturday, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said that the terrorism level threat will remain at 4 in Spain. He added that the main terror cell has been dismantled, and that he is confident about the rest of the investigation.\n\nCatalan police official Josep Lluis Trapero said at a press conference Friday that investigators still have not conclusively identified the driver, who was at large after fleeing on foot. But one of the five alleged terrorists killed in Cambrils could potentially be the driver in Barcelona, Trapero added.\n\nCatalan police released a notice on Friday saying they are searching for four individuals in connection to the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils. The wanted individuals were identified as 24-year-old Moroccan citizen Mohamed Hychami; 22-year-old Moroccan Younes Abouyaaqoub; 18-year-old Moroccan Said Aalla; and 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir, who was born in Spain but is a Moroccan citizen.\n\nAbouyacoub’s identification was found inside Barcelona attack van, according to Spanish National Police, who said it could have been left by mistake, or a tactical signature.\n\nSpanish Police via EPA\n\nCatalan police believe the incident in Cambrils is related to Thursday's vehicle attack in Barcelona as well as Wednesday's huge explosion at a house in Alcanar, where a terror cell allegedly planned their attacks.\n\nThe blast, which killed one person, injured others and caused part of the house to collapse, was initially dismissed by authorities as a gas explosion. Now, after the deadly incidents in Barcelona and Cambrils, police are looking again at the Alcanar explosion.\n\n'We work on the hypothesis that the terrorists killed in Cambrils would be related to the events in Barcelona and Alcanar,' Catalan police said.\n\nThe terror cell appears to be composed of about a dozen young men, a number of whom are of Spanish and Moroccan descent, according to law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation. The cell members would include the five men killed in Cambrils, the four others who were detained and potentially those killed in the house explosion, the officials said.\n\nThe FBI is sending a team of agents to Spain following the confirmed death of an American citizen.\n\nManuel Garcia\n\nCatalonia Interior Minister Joaquin Forn said at a press conference Thursday night that authorities are still working to identify those who died in the Barcelona attack, and the number of dead and injured could rise.\n\nForn declared three days of national mourning and said a moment of silence will be held on Friday at Barcelona's Catalonia Square where the deadly attack unfolded.\n\nThose injured and killed in the Barcelona and Cambrils attacks represented at least 34 different nationalities, according to a preliminary assessment by Catalan police.\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said at a press conference Friday that four Australians were injured. Meanwhile, Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Didier Reynders said one Belgian national was killed.\n\nVil_Music/Twitter\n\nA spokesperson for Tucker's family said in a statement Friday, 'At present Jared's wife Heidi is not issuing a statement and will issue a formal statement tomorrow. For now, she asks that the community and media hold their family up in prayer and asks for the privacy during this difficult time.'\n\nEarlier Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed that the Department of State had 'received word and confirmed the death of one American citizen in the terrorist attack in Spain.' U.S. officials are 'still confirming the injuries and deaths of others,' he added.\n\n'Hate is not an American value,' Tillerson told reporters.\n\ncarlos_tg_32/Instagram\n\nTillerson didn't specify which attack the U.S. citizen was killed. However, a State Department official told ABC News the American was killed in Barcelona. The official also confirmed that that another American citizen was injured.\n\n'The U.S. Consulate General in Barcelona continues to work with local authorities to identify and provide assistance to U.S. citizens affected by the terrorist attacks in Las Ramblas and Cambril. At this time, we can confirm that one U.S. citizen was killed,' the official said in a statement Friday. 'We also can confirm that another U.S. citizen sustained a minor injury. Spanish authorities report that there are still several casualties who are not yet identified. Out of respect for the families’ privacy in their time of grief, we have no further comment.'\n\nJosep Lago/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCatalan police have said there is no proof that the van driver in Barcelona was armed, but they described the incident as a terror attack that attempted to kill as many people as possible.\n\nIn a separate incident Thursday, police said a driver attempting to get past a Barcelona checkpoint struck an officer and another individual. One person died and the officer suffered a broken leg.\n\nThe man driving the car died of a knife wound. There is still no evidence that this incident is connected to the attack on La Rambla boulevard, police said.\n\nJosep Lago/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSpanish authorities told ABC News the white van used in the Barcelona attack was rented in the name of 28-year-old Driss Oukabir, who was taken into custody within hours of the incident. However, Oukabir claimed his license was stolen.\n\nMultiple Spanish law enforcement sources told ABC News that Driss has since been released, and the investigation is now focused on his younger brother as the possible driver.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the vehicle-ramming attack in Barcelona through its Amaq News Agency, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.\n\nJosep Lago/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Thursday expressed solidarity with the victims and their families, describing the attack in Barcelona as 'jihadist terrorism.'\n\nThose responsible for the rampage will be brought to justice, he said, stressing that the response to the terrorism must be global.\n\nRajoy said Barcelona residents are suffering 'the same pain and the same uncertainty' as their neighbors in Madrid, Paris, Nice, Brussels and London, referencing other European cities that have also been subject to deadly terror attacks.\n\nManu Fernandez/AP\n\nABC News' Lucien Bruggeman, Erin Dooley, Carolyn Durand, Rachel Katz, Kirit Radia and Darren Reynolds contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/truck-hits-pedestrians-busy-barcelona-street/story?id=49272618","None"
"Troubled By Flint Water Crisis, 11-Year-Old Girl Invents Lead-Detecting Device\nTroubled By Flint Water Crisis, 11-Year-Old Girl Invents Lead-Detecting Device\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andy King/Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge Andy King/Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge\n\nWhen the drinking water in Flint, Mich., became contaminated with lead, causing a major public health crisis, 11-year-old Gitanjali Rao took notice.\n\n'I had been following the Flint, Michigan, issue for about two years,' the seventh-grader told ABC News. 'I was appalled by the number of people affected by lead contamination in water.'\n\nShe saw her parents testing the water in their own home in Lone Tree, Colo., and was unimpressed by the options, which can be slow, unreliable or both.\n\n'I went, 'Well, this is not a reliable process and I've got to do something to change this,' ' Rao told Business Insider.\n\nRao tells ABC that while she was doing her weekly perusal of MIT's Materials Science and Engineering website to see 'if there's anything's new,' she read about new technologies that could detect hazardous substances and decided to see whether they could be adapted to test for lead.\n\nThe Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge YouTube\n\nShe pressed local high schools and universities to give her lab time and then hunkered down in the 'science room' — outfitted with a big white table — that she persuaded her engineer parents to create in their home.\n\nAnd she set about devising a more efficient solution: a device that could identify lead compounds in water and was portable and relatively inexpensive.\n\nAs she explains at lightning speed in her video submission for the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge, her device consists of three parts. There is a disposable cartridge containing chemically treated carbon nanotube arrays, an Arduino-based signal processor with a Bluetooth attachment, and a smartphone app that can display the results.\n\nHere is how it works.\n\nThe carbon nanotubes in the cartridge are sensitive to changes in the flow of electrons. Those tubes are lined with atoms that have an affinity to lead, which adds a measurable resistance to the electron flow.\n\nWhen the cartridge is dipped in water that is clean, the electron flow doesn't change and the smartphone app shows that water is safe to drink. But when the cartridge is dipped in contaminated water, the lead in the water reacts to the atoms, causing resistance in the electron flow that is measured by the Arduino processor. The app then shows that the water isn't safe to drink.\n\nRao dubbed the device Tethys, for the Greek goddess of fresh water.\n\n'Clean water always makes you feel good,' she says at the end of her video. 'The tool allows easy testing at home or by agencies for quick detection and remedial actions. It can be expanded in the future to test for other chemical contaminants in potable water. I hope this helps in a small way to detect and prevent long-term health effects of lead contamination for many of us.'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bharathi Rao Bharathi Rao\n\nHer solution was so ingenious that this week, Rao was named 'America's Top Young Scientist' in the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge — a distinction that comes with a check for $25,000.\n\nFor the past three months, Rao and nine other finalists in the competition had been paired with scientists at 3M who helped them work from a theoretical concept to a physical prototype. Rao was matched with Kathleen Shafer, a research specialist who develops new plastics technologies.\n\nRao plans to save some of the prize money for college but use the rest to invest in her device to make it commercially viable.\n\n'It's not hyperbole to say she really blew us out of the water,' Brian Barnhart, a school superintendent in Illinois and one of the judges, told ABC. 'The other nine kids, they were also such amazing kids, so for her to stand out the way she did with a peer group like this is like an exclamation point on top of it.'\n\nRao says that when she grows up, she would like to be a geneticist or epidemiologist. Her lead detection device allowed her to combine both interests, as contaminated water can cause both rashes and birth defects.\n\n'I studied a little bit of both of these topics since I was really interested in these fields,' she told Business Insider, 'and then I came up with this device to help save lives.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/20/559071028/troubled-by-flint-water-crisis-11-year-old-girl-invents-lead-detecting-device","1508472000.0"

So far, a motive has been elusive to investigators.\n\nThe frequent gambler, described as a loner, spent months amassing his arsenal, staying under the radar with no one suspecting he would turn to extreme violence.\n\nHis finances did not appear to be a problem and Paddock had settled any debts he had with casinos shortly before the attack, a source said.\n\nOther mass shooters in the United States have left behind writings, manifestos or even videos explaining their actions — however deranged those explanations may have been.\n\nPaddock, however, left behind no such writings or evidence.\n\nHe is not the first mass shooter to destroy or hide digital clues.\n\nIn 2007, Virginia Tech shooter Cho Seung Hui left a video explaining his grievances, but took the step of removing the hard drive of his computer and disposing of his cell phone shortly before the massacre. Authorities even searched a pond for the missing digital media, but the devices were never recovered.\n\nThe 2008 Northern Illinois shooter, Steven Kazmierczak, removed the SIM card from his phone and the hard drive from his laptop, and neither was recovered.\n\nIn 2012, Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza had removed the hard drive from his computer and smashed it with a hammer or screwdriver.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/las-vegas-shooters-laptop-missing-hard-drive/story?id=50709285","None"

And the whole thing is costing him just $20,000, according to the AP. (It goes without saying, but we'll say this anyway: Do not try this at home — or anywhere.)\n\n'I don't believe in science,' Hughes added. 'I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that's not science, that's just a formula. There's no difference between science and science fiction.'\n\nThe plan, as stated, is to send himself 1,800 feet high in the air at a speed of 500 mph before finally pulling out his parachutes — which, one hopes, will not be the same ones he used for another launch in 2014. Hughes, 61, told a flat-Earth community Web show that the flight, which the AP said took him a quarter-mile across Arizona desert, ended when he pulled his parachutes — two of which he said were at least 20 years old at the time and one of which didn't open.\n\n'Yeah, it was a scary moment,' he said in the interview, adding that he had to use a walker for several weeks after his landing. 'I had never parachuted before.'\n\nYouTube\n\nIt was not his first time tinkering with a big hunk of metal, however. Though Hughes may drive limousines for a living, he says he has worked in NASCAR pit crews, and The Washington Post reports he 'has been building rockets for years.'\n\nJust don't liken the man's entrepreneurial spirit to that of Elon Musk, who 'is a giant fraud,' according to Hughes. In fact, many notable space explorers came in for Hughes' criticism during the interview, including the 'Freemason' NASA astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong. Hughes maintained that all of them have been involved in 'the roots of the deception' that the Earth is round.\n\nNow, it must be noted that humans knew the world was round long, long before NASA launched astronauts into space and we saw pictures of our spherical planet from afar. As the BBC points out, Aristotle — a Greek man with no known connections to NASA or Freemasonry — explained how we know back around 350 B.C.:\n\n'Again, our observations of the stars make it evident, not only that the Earth is circular, but also that it is a circle of no great size. For quite a small change of position to south or north causes a manifest alteration of the horizon.'\n\nOther famed explorers who have circumnavigated the globe, such as Ferdinand Magellan and Sir Francis Drake, also failed to report observing the sea ice that many flat-Earthers believe marks the ends of our earthly disc.\n\nStill, Hughes converted to the flat-Earth belief recently, shortly after his first fundraising campaign for the rocket earned just $310 of its $150,000 goal. His second campaign, this time posted after his conversion and with the support of the flat-Earth community, succeeded in hitting its $7,875 goal.\n\n'I've been a believer for maybe almost a year. I researched it for several months in between doing everything else — you know, I've still got to make a living and all that kind of stuff, and building this rocket actually eats up a lot of my time,' he told the flat-Earth Web show. 'But when I'm not doing that, I research things.'\n\nAnd Hughes intends that research to continue well beyond Saturday's launch, which he says he will be streaming online. He envisions the launch as just one step toward eventually getting himself into space, at which point he plans to take a photograph 'to prove once and for all this Earth is flat,' he told his interviewer.\n\n'This is the king of the deceptions,' Hughes said. 'Once this domino falls, this is it.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/22/565926690/i-dont-believe-in-science-says-flat-earther-set-to-launch-himself-in-own-rocket","1511326800.0"

The ancient wall -- first constructed in the 8th century by the Abbasid dynasty and stretching around the Old City on three sides -- has provided important fortification for ISIS.\n\nThe operation was 'a key milestone' in the campaign to 'liberate the city,' Brett McGurk, the US envoy for the anti-ISIS coalition, said on his official Twitter account.\n\nIn a CENTCOM statement, the US added: 'Coalition forces supported the SDF advance into the most heavily fortified portion of Raqqa by opening two small gaps in the Rafiqah Wall that surrounds the Old City.'\n\nThe battle for Raqqa is not dissimilar to that of Mosul, where US-backed Iraqi forces are fighting to expel the last of ISIS fighters from Iraq's second-largest city.

"Trump admin. to reverse ban on elephant trophies from Africa\nThe Trump administration plans to allow hunters to bring trophies of elephants they killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia back to the United States, reversing a ban put in place by the Obama administration in 2014, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official confirmed for ABC News today.\n\nInterested in Trump Administration? Add Trump Administration as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Trump Administration news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nEven though elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, a provision in the act allows the government to give permits to import such trophies if there is evidence that the hunting benefits conservation for that species. The official said the administration has new information from officials in Zimbabwe and Zambia to support reversing the ban.\n\nDe Agostini/Getty Images\n\n'Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,' a Fish and Wildlife spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThis change applies only to elephants in those two countries. It prompted questions about using game hunting to generate money for conservation efforts, and similar questions arose after the controversial killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe in 2015.\n\nThe government has not officially announced this policy change yet, but it was reportedly raised at a wildlife forum in South Africa this week, according to Safari Club International, which filed a lawsuit to block the 2014 ban.\n\nIt's unclear how the current political situation in Zimbabwe could affect this decision, but a blog post from the president of the Humane Society of the United States points out that poaching has been a problem in Zimbabwe over the years and that the hunting industry there faces corruption issues.\n\nA notice regarding this reversal will be posted in the Federal Register on Friday with specifics on the new information justifying the change.\n\nThe permits will apply to elephants hunted in Zimbabwe from Jan. 21, 2016, to Dec. 31, 2018, and elephants hunted in Zambia during 2016, 2017 and 2018 for applications that meet all other applicable requirements, according to the Fish and Wildlife spokesperson.\n\nSavanna elephant populations declined by 30 percent across 18 countries in Africa from 2007 to 2014, according to the Great Elephant Census published last year, which put their remaining numbers at just over 350,000.\n\nThe elephant population declined 6 percent overall in Zimbabwe but dropped by 74 percent within one specific region. Elephants saw 'substantial declines along the Zambezi River,' in Zambia while other areas of that country were stable, according to the census.\n\nTsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP Photo\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service has been talking with wildlife officials in Zimbabwe since the ban was announced in 2014. Since then, Zimbabwe officials have stepped up efforts to combat poaching, established a system to report financial benefit from American hunters and provided more information on how officials establish hunting quotas, according to the text of the federal register notice that will be posted Friday.\n\nThe census reported about 82,000 elephants in Zimbabwe. Wildlife officials set annual quotas limiting hunting there to 500 elephants in different areas.\n\nElephant hunting has been banned in Zambia several times over the years because of declining population but was re-established in 2015 after surveys found a larger population in some areas. Zambia is home to some 22,000 elephants, according to the census.\n\nTourists may hunt elephants on private game ranches or specified areas in Zambia, many of which are on the outskirts of national parks. Zambian officials carry out anti-poaching efforts and manage elephant hunting through permits and quotas, according to the Federal Register notice. In 2016, 30 elephants were allowed to be killed there as trophies, but the government reported that only 12 males were killed, according to the notice.\n\nFees paid by hunters are used to fund the country's conservation efforts.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-admin-reverse-ban-elephant-trophies-africa/story?id=51178663","None"

"‘I told him I can’t breathe’: Police punch teen girl after mistaking her for black male suspect\nThe Bakersfield chapter of the NAACP shared a video of Tatyana Hargrove discussing her encounter with police in Bakersfield, Calif., who mistook her for a male suspect. (NAACP Bakersfield)\n\nOn the day Tatyana Hargrove rode her bike to try to buy her dad a Father’s Day gift, temperatures in Bakersfield, Calif., had reached triple digits, so she stopped on the way home to take a drink of water in the shade.\n\nThe 19-year-old girl turned around at the intersection where she had paused and noticed three police cars. One of the officers, she said, had already drawn his gun.\n\nWhat followed, according to both Hargrove and police, was a case of mistaken identity and an altercation in which police punched Hargrove in the mouth, unleashed a police K-9 dog on her and arrested her. Though the incident took place June 18, it gained wider attention this week after the Bakersfield chapter of the NAACP shared a video of Hargrove’s account on its Facebook page that garnered millions of views.\n\nOn the day police stopped Hargrove, officers had been looking for a suspect — described as a 25- to 30-year-old, bald black man standing 5-foot-10 and weighing about 170 pounds — who had threatened several people with a machete at a nearby grocery store, according to a police report.\n\n“She appeared to be a male and matched the description of the suspect that had brandished the machete and was also within the same complex the suspect had fled to,” Christopher Moore, the arresting officer, wrote in his report.\n\nBut Hargrove is none of those things.\n\nFor starters, she is female. She stands 5-foot-2 and weighs 115 pounds “soaking wet,” according to her father in a widely shared video of Hargrove’s account of the incident posted on the Facebook page for the Bakersfield chapter of the NAACP.\n\nIn the video, Hargrove stands with a pair of crutches near the intersection where she was stopped by police and described how one of the officers demanded she give him her backpack, she said.\n\nWhen she asked if they had a warrant, one of the officers gestured toward a police K-9 behind him, she said.\n\n“I then got scared and then I was like, here, take the backpack, just take the backpack,” Hargrove added.\n\nAfter that, she said in the video, the officer grabbed her by her wrist, then punched her and threw her onto the ground; shortly afterward, the police K-9 “came and started eating at my leg.”\n\n[Minn. officer acquitted in shooting of Philando Castile during traffic stop, dismissed from police force]\n\nThe same officer then put his knee on her back and other knee against her head, despite her protests, she said.\n\n“I told him ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe’ and then I started yelling out, ‘Somebody help me, somebody help me! They’re gonna kill me!’” she said. “And then finally, he let me up, he tied my hands behind my back and then he tied my feet together and he threw me in the back of the car.”\n\nAccording to the police report, Hargrove was arrested for resisting or delaying an officer and aggravated assault on an officer. Hargrove was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of her injuries, including abrasions on her face and scrapes and punctures from the police K-9’s “engagement on her right thigh,” Moore, the arresting officer, wrote in his report.\n\nMoore noted that “several nurses” at the hospital referred to Hargrove as a male and that “when I corrected them and advised she was a female they were surprised and apologized for the mistake.”\n\nAfter she was treated for her injuries, Hargrove was booked into jail, the report said. She was detained for nearly 16 hours there before being bailed out by her parents, according to the NAACP.\n\nIn the police report, Moore wrote that Hargrove had “spun into” one of the officers with her left shoulder, causing him to fall backward, and then “quickly maneuvered her body to get back on top of him” after the officer punched her.\n\n“At this time I was forced to quickly consider the following; [Hargrove] matched the description of the suspect that had brandished a machete, her backpack was within her arm’s reach and the main compartment was unzipped allowing her immediate access to the machete,” Moore wrote. After weighing whether he could use his Taser or baton on Hargrove, Moore wrote that he decided to unleash the police K-9, Hamer.\n\nIn the police report, Moore wrote that after officers placed Hargrove in a police car, she continued to scream out of the window at them for about five minutes.\n\n“While Hargrove was in the backseat I asked what her name was and when she provided it as ‘Tatyana’ I said, ‘Don’t lie to me, that’s a girl’s name. What is your name?’ ” the police report stated. “Hargrove said, ‘I’m a girl, I just don’t dress like one.’ This was when I first discovered she was a female.”\n\nA search of her backpack revealed no weapons, the report stated.\n\n[Seattle police fatally shoot pregnant woman who they say confronted officers with a knife]\n\nA Bakersfield police spokesman told The Washington Post he would not comment further on the case but confirmed that the department had determined that the officers had exercised appropriate use of force on Hargrove.\n\nIn the video on the Bakersfield NAACP’s Facebook page, Hargrove does not say anything about fighting back at the officers.\n\n“I read the paper, my paperwork, though, and it said that I shoved an officer and flipped him on his back,” she said in the video, adding a look of disbelief. “There were dogs and guns drawn on me. Like, I would never do anything like that.”\n\nA call to the Bakersfield chapter of the NAACP was not immediately returned early Wednesday afternoon. The group is organizing a “Justice for Tatyana” rally Thursday, started a Change.org petition to have Hargrove’s charges dismissed and launched a crowdfunding page to raise money for her medical bills and legal fees.\n\nHargrove’s parents, who were interviewed for the video but not named, said it was extremely difficult for them to believe what happened to their daughter could be justified.\n\n“Every day I have to change her bandages and I see her, the injuries that she has. It’s really hard for me,” Hargrove’s mother said in the video, fighting back tears.\n\n“Why should my daughter be charged with a crime? All she did was stop to drink some water because it was 100-something degrees. That’s ridiculous,” Hargrove’s father said in the video. “She was coming home to celebrate Father’s Day with me.

"The end of the Anglo-American order?\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThere has always been a shared conceit at the heart of the special relationship between the United States and United Kingdom that global leadership is best expressed and exerted in English.\n\nMore boastful than the Brits, successive US presidents have trumpeted the notion of American exceptionalism.\n\nPrime ministers, in a more understated manner, have also come to believe in British exceptionalism, the idea that Westminster is the mother parliament, and that the UK has a governing model and liberal values that set the global standard for others to follow, not least its former colonies.\n\nIn the post-war Anglo-American order those ideas came together. In many ways, it was the product of Anglo-American exceptionalist thinking: the 'city upon a hill' meets 'this sceptred isle'.\n\nNato, the IMF, the World Bank and the Five Eyes intelligence community all stemmed from the Atlantic Charter signed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in August 1941.\n\nThe liberalised free trade system that flourished after the war is often called the Anglo-Saxon model. The post-world global architecture, diplomatic, mercantile and financial, was largely an English-speaking construct.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn recent weeks, however, the Anglo-American order has looked increasingly weak and wobbly. The unexpectedly messy result of the British election makes it look still more fragile, like a historic edifice left tottering in the wake of a major quake.\n\nThere is uncertainty in Westminster, and something nearing chaos in Washington because of Russian probe at the White House and on Capitol Hill.\n\nNeither Britain nor America can boast strong and stable governments. Neither have the look of global exemplars.\n\nIn the six weeks since Theresa May called her snap election, the global tectonic plates have shifted fast, leaving Britain and America increasingly adrift.\n\nDonald Trump, during his first international trip, refused to publicly endorse Article V of the Nato treaty and publicly scolded his allies over financial burden sharing.\n\nHe found himself isolated at the G7 summit in Sicily. Then, on his return to Washington, came the announcement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, a decision of massive planetary and geopolitical import.\n\nHung Parliament: What happens now?\n\nA simple guide to the UK election result\n\nHow the world reacted\n\nHere, America First meant America alone, and Trump seemed to revel in his neo-isolationism - as he did when he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership early in his presidency.\n\nFor Britain, the diplomatic impact of Brexit has also become clearer in recent weeks. EU leaders have bluntly outlined how they will set the terms of the divorce settlement, in what looks more and more like a diktat than an amicable separation.\n\nThe 27 remaining members of the EU have also made it clear they intend to penalise the UK.\n\nWhen Jean-Claude Juncker met Theresa May at Downing Street shortly after she called the election, he was evidently dismayed by her approach.\n\n'I'm leaving Downing Street 10 times more sceptical than I was before,' the EU Commission president reportedly informed his host.\n\nAs one senior EU diplomat put it to me: 'Britain has shot itself in one foot. We intend to shoot you in the other.'\n\nThe British prime minister, by failing to win an election she didn't have to call, has weakened her bargaining position still further. Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt has already called the UK election: 'Yet another own goal.'\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nIn recent weeks it is not only the UK's relations with the EU that have become more strained. Its cherished trans-Atlantic alliance has also been subject to some unforeseen stress tests.\n\nI never expected to report that Britain would stop sharing sensitive intelligence with the United States, but that was the story we broke in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing.\n\nThen, following the London attack, came Donald Trump's Twitter assault on the London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Again, in the pre-Trump world it would have been unthinkable for a US President to mount such a vicious attack on a British mayor in the wake of a UK terror attack.\n\nSir Christopher Meyer, Britain's former ambassador in Washington, seemed to capture the public mood when he noted: 'Trump makes me puke.'\n\nThe prime minister steered clear of delivering a stiff public rebuke to the President over his attack on Mayor Khan, presumably out of fear of angering Donald Trump and jeopardising a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.\n\nPerhaps this also explained why she didn't join with Germany, France and Italy in signing a joint declaration slamming Trump's Paris decision.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test\n\nBut again that emphasises Britain's weakness. The special relationship has always been an asymmetrical relationship but now it seems even more lop-sided. It speaks of the UK's post-Brexit diplomacy of desperation.\n\nThe trans-Atlantic alliance will eventually have to deal with a longer-term problem that will outlast the Trump administration. One of Britain's great uses to Washington in recent decades has been as a bridge to the European Union.\n\nIt's why Barack Obama lobbied so hard for a 'remain' vote ahead of last year's referendum. Under future US presidents, it is easy to imagine a German-American alliance supplanting the special relationship.\n\nVoids in global leadership are immediately filled, and we've seen that happen at warp speed over the past few weeks. Brexit has galvanised the European Union. The election of Emmanuel Macron has revitalised the Franco-German alliance, giving it a more youthful and dynamic look.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nPost-Paris, a green alliance has emerged between Beijing and Brussels. More broadly, China sees the chance to extend its sphere of influence, positioning itself on environmental issues as the international pace-setter. Even before Mr Trump took the oath of office, this looked more likely to be the Asian Century rather than a repeat of the American Century.\n\nEurope eyes an enhanced role for itself, too. 'We Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands,' declared Angela Merkel during a speech in a Bavarian beer hall after the disastrous G7 summit.\n\nIn a pointed dig at America and Britain, she also warned that the days when Germany could completely rely on others are 'over to a certain extent'.\n\nMore and more, the German chancellor looks like the leader of the free world, something that would have required a massive leap of imagination in the years immediately after World War II, when the English-speaking liberal global order was taking shape.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWinston Churchill, during the 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri, in which he coined the phrase 'special relationship' (and also the 'iron curtain'), noted: 'It is necessary that constancy of mind, persistency of purpose, and the grand simplicity of decision shall guide and rule the conduct of the English-speaking peoples in peace as they did in war. We must, and I believe we shall, prove ourselves equal to this severe requirement.'\n\nRight now, both the United States and the United Kingdom seem to be failing that Churchillian test.\n\nThese English-speaking nations no longer speak with such a clarion voice, and the rest of the world no longer takes such heed.\n\nA new world order seems to be emerging that is being articulated in other tongues.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40227270","None"
"In a nutshell, human error (and peanut butter) caused jailbreak\n(CNN) Authorities in Alabama have finally put the lid on an unusual jailbreak.\n\nA dozen inmates at the Walker County Jail in Jasper made a run for it on Sunday night. Most were quickly caught.\n\nThey are all back behind bars now, with the final fugitive recaptured Tuesday night.\n\nTheir escape plan: Trick a new employee into opening an outside door.\n\nThe weapon of choice: peanut butter.\n\n'It may sound crazy, but these people are crazy like a fox,' Walker County Sheriff Jim Underwood said at a news conference in Jasper on Monday.\n\nThe great escape\n\nThe inmates basically took advantage of a new, unidentified guard who was working in the control room, keeping track of 140 inmates.\n\n'The young man, he was a weak link and they knew it,' Underwood said. '... That's it in a nutshell.'\n\nWhat the guard believed to be an inmate's cell door was actually a door leading outside, Underwood said.\n\n'They changed the number over the (cell) door with peanut butter' to match the door to the outside, he said. '(Then) they hollered, 'Hey, open door' so-and-so, but (the number the inmates gave the worker) was the outside door. And unknowingly to him, he hit that lock and out the door they went,' Underwood said.\n\nThe sheriff blames the whole situation on a mistake.\n\n'We got some evil people down here,' Underwood said.\n\n'And they scheme all the time to con us and our employees here at the jail. You have to stay on your toes. This is one time we slipped up. I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a human error that caused this to happen.'\n\nThe recapture\n\nThe inmates threw a blanket over the barbed wire fence, which is about 15-feet high, Underwood said.\n\nThe sheriff estimates it took the inmates about 10 minutes to make their escape.\n\nNo one was injured in the hunt, the sheriff said.\n\n'One (inmate) in the hospital had to have his thumb sown back on where the razor wire cut it,' Underwood said.\n\nUnderwood said the first 11 escapes were captured with eight hours.\n\nMost of them were found in the Jasper area, Underwood said. Some of them took off on foot, while others are suspected of getting in a car.\n\nJasper Mayor David O'Mary told CNN sister network HLN that the escapees apparently stayed together after they were outside the jail facility, and that played a big role in allowing the police to catch the suspects in a short period.\n\nTwo had been jailed on attempted murder allegations.\n\nManhunt over\n\nBrady Andrew Kilpatrick, was caught Tuesday evening, the sheriff's office said. Authorities announced the end of the manhunt by adding '***KILPATRICK CAPTURED AS OF 08/01/2017 6:38pm' to a Facebook post on the sheriff's The 12th escapee,Brady Andrew Kilpatrick,was caught Tuesday evening, the sheriff's office said. Authorities announced the end of the manhunt by adding '***KILPATRICK CAPTURED AS OF 08/01/2017 6:38pm' to a Facebook post on the sheriff's department's page\n\nKilpatrick, 24, was tracked down 600 miles from Jasper in Martin County, on the east coast of South Florida, the sheriff's office there said.\n\nHe had been jailed for alleged drug offenses.\n\nKilpatrick's attorney, Belinda Ann Weldon, told CNN affiliate WBMA-TV in Alabama that she believes drugs played a role in the Sunday night escape.\n\nJasper is about 35 miles northwest of Birmingham. The Walker County Jail was opened in 1998 and houses 250 inmates, according to its website.\n\nCNN Map\n\nJail breaks make use of infrastructure\n\nOther recent jailbreaks have seen inmates take advantage of building infrastructure.\n\nIn June, four inmates climbed out of an air conditioning vent at Oklahoma's Lincoln County Jail. It was the second time escaping using the same method for three of them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Walker County sheriff said officials would look again at placing a young person in an control area to make decisions for 140 inmates. The camera system also needs to be equipped with more monitors, he added.\n\nDespite the current sticky situation, the sheriff said he doesn't have plans to put any dietary restrictions in place in the future.\n\n'They love peanut butter sandwiches,' said Underwood.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/01/us/alabama-inmate-escape/index.html","1501560000.0"

"John McCain fights back\nOn Friday, John McCain announced that he will once again vote against repeal of the Affordable Care Act -- once again disappointing his fellow Republicans and President Trump.\n\nIn a statement he said: 'I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing...How many people will be helped or hurt by it.'\n\nCBS News\n\nAnd so the senator from Arizona has lived up to his reputation as a maverick and a fighter.\n\nMcCain, who survived torture and solitary confinement during his five-and-a-half years as a POW in Vietnam, is now, at 81, in a second fight for his life -- this time against glioblastoma, a deadly and unforgiving brain cancer.\n\nHe invited us to his ranch just outside of Sedona, Arizona, 24 acres of old-growth trees, a family of hawks and a rippling creek that his dog Burma likes to swim in.\n\n'I am more energetic and more engaged as a result of this because I know that I've got to do everything I can to serve this country while I can.'\n\nLesley Stahl: I'm wondering if when you're up here if it's like medicine for you.\n\nJohn McCain: Oh yeah, oh yeah. It puts everything in perspective.\n\nCBS News\n\nHe and his wife Cindy have raised four children. They have survived two grueling presidential campaigns, a battle against melanoma – and now this.\n\nLesley Stahl: You're taking both radiation and chemotherapy?\n\nJohn McCain: Yep.\n\nLesley Stahl: You look terrific. How is this possible?\n\nJohn McCain: I feel fine and I'm eating everything that she makes me eat, all of which-- none of which is--\n\nLesley Stahl: Is any good?\n\nCBS News\n\nJohn McCain: Yeah, exactly. One criteria to feeding people that are under my situation, it has to taste lousy.\n\nLesley Stahl: He has been through so much?\n\nCindy McCain: Uh-huh (affirm).\n\nLesley Stahl: I mean, the torture and the-- you were put in solitary confinement?\n\nCindy McCain: Uh-huh (affirm).\n\nLesley Stahl: He's always been the indestructible man?\n\nCindy McCain: Uh-huh (affirm).\n\nJohn McCain: Crashed two airplanes.\n\nLesley Stahl: Crashing two airplanes and walked away?\n\nJohn McCain: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: Is he still the indestructible man to you?\n\nCindy McCain: I'm still in disbelief that this actually has happened. And then I think, you know, cancer chose the wrong guy. 'Cause there-- it's not gonna happen here.\n\nDetermined to stay in the arena, Senator McCain has resumed his duties in Washington. You'd never know it, but he starts his days with chemo and radiation. And then heads to a full day of work including chairing hearings of the Armed Services Committee.\n\nJohn McCain: I am more energetic and more engaged as a result of this because I know that I've got to do everything I can to serve this country while I can.\n\nLesley Stahl: Now you have the same cancer that Ted Kennedy had. Does what he experienced go through your mind? Is it--\n\nJohn McCain: Oh, yeah. I think about Ted a lot. Ted stayed at his job, kept working. Kept going even when he was in a wheelchair. And he never gave up because he loved the engagement.\n\nThe senator first learned he had a problem in Arizona back in July when doctors found a blood clot over his left eye after a routine check up at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. He was driving back to the ranch when he got word.\n\nJohn McCain: I was driving up here, and I got about two-thirds of the way up. And my doctor called and said, 'You've got to come back.' And I said, 'Hey, today's Friday. I'll just come in on Monday.' And she said, 'No, you have to come now. It's very serious.'\n\nLesley Stahl: You turned the car around?\n\nJohn McCain: Uh-huh (affirm).\n\nLesley Stahl: And went immediately into surgery?\n\nJohn McCain: Yes. They thought it was serious enough that they had to act immediately.\n\nLesley Stahl: And before the blood clot operation, did they mention glioblastoma to you?\n\nJohn McCain: Yes. But, as you know, doctors are interesting.\n\nLesley Stahl: They cover themselves.\n\nJohn McCain: I kept saying to them, 'Tell it to me straight.' 'Well, there's always this. There's always that.' You know, and-- and I said, 'I can take it. Just tell me.' And then they were more forthcoming.\n\nFive days after the surgery, lab results confirmed he had glioblastoma.\n\nLesley Stahl: What did they tell you about the prognosis?\n\nJohn McCain: They said that it's very serious. That the prognosis is very, very serious. Some say three percent, some say 14 percent. You know, it's a very poor prognosis. So I just said, 'I understand. Now we're gonna do what we can, get the best doctors we can find and do the best we can.' And, at the same time, celebrate with gratitude a life well lived.\n\nLesley Stahl: Was he that tough?\n\nCindy McCain: Yes. He is that tough.\n\nJust 11 days after his surgery, he returned to Washington – against doctors' advice – for the vote to repeal Obamacare.\n\nLesley Stahl: You walk out onto the Senate floor. You thought it was gonna be normal, empty, mostly empty. And the entire Senate is there. They stand up. They give you an incredible ovation. What went on inside--\n\nJohn McCain: Oh, I got very choked up. And then, of course, you know, all of 'em coming over and giving me a hug. It was deeply moving. I had never seen anything like that.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you get all this affection. And then you give them this speech kinda scolding to the people who just stood up and loved you. This was a speech condemning the way the Senate has been operating.\n\nMcCain's Senate speech: We're getting nothing done my friends. We're getting nothing done because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.\n\nTwo days later, as the repeal Obamacare vote was underway, McCain was subjected to urgent lobbying by Vice President Pence and the president himself, over the phone. And yet, at 1:29 a.m., McCain delivered the dramatic and decisive 'thumbs down.' As a dejected Majority Leader Mitch McConnell bowed his head.\n\nIt was a huge defeat for President Trump -- who has mocked McCain's Vietnam War record.\n\nPresident Trump: He's not a war hero. He's a war hero – he's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, OK.\n\nLesley Stahl: There are some people who think that part of your 'no' was to get back at the president and that the thumbs down was kind of more like a middle finger to him.\n\nJohn McCain: If I took offense at everybody who has said something about me, or disparaged me or something like that-- life is too short. You've gotta move on. And on an issue of this importance to the nation, for me to worry about a personal relationship, then I'm not doing my job.\n\nBut the fact is his personal relationship with the president has been fraught. Just last month, he wrote an op-ed saying the president is, quote 'often poorly informed' and 'can be impulsive.'\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you worry that he's not fit for the office?\n\nJohn McCain: First of all I believe in our system. The American people selected Donald Trump to be president of the United States. We have to respect that. Second of all, he has a very strong national security team around him who I know has significant influence over him.\n\nLesley Stahl: Let's talk for a minute about DACA. The Dreamers Act. Donald Trump, the president, a Republican, has embraced Nancy Pelosi. You go out and watch Republican campaign ads around the country. She's the target.\n\nJohn McCain: Sure.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think he has initiated divorce proceedings with Republicans?\n\nJohn McCain: I don't know what he's gonna do tomorrow. So-- or say tomorrow. Lesley, he changes his statements almost on a daily basis. So for me to spend my time trying to analyze what he says, I don't know.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did he ever apologize for saying you're not a hero?\n\nJohn McCain: No.\n\nLesley Stahl: If the president wanted to have a rapprochement with you, would you be receptive?\n\nJohn McCain: Of course. Of course. I've supported him on national security. I've supported his team--\n\nLesley Stahl: But personal. I'm talking about man to man--\n\nJohn McCain: Personal? Sure. I'd be glad to converse with him. But I also understand that we're very different people. Different upbringing. Different life experiences.\n\nLesley Stahl: What do you mean by that and what does it make you think about?\n\nJohn McCain: He is in the business of making money and he has been successful both in television as well as Miss America and others. I was raised in a military family. I was raised in the concept and belief that duty, honor, country is the-- is the lodestar for the behavior that we have to exhibit every single day.\n\nThe son and grandson of 4-star admirals, he's the first to admit he's an imperfect man -- though he has made real sacrifices for his country.\n\nLesley Stahl: When you think about your horrible time as a POW, the torture and everything-- do you relive it? Or has it now faded so much that you can almost see it as if it happened to someone else?\n\nJohn McCain: Listen, the joy of my life was the bonds that were forged between me and my fellow POWs. They were wonderful. We fought together. We loved each other. We would tap on the walls to each other. I look back on that experience with a great deal of pride.\n\n'I want-- when I leave, that the ceremony is at the Naval Academy. And we just have a couple of people that stand up and say, 'This guy, he served his country.''\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think that this diagnosis has changed you?\n\nJohn McCain: No.\n\nLesley Stahl: Not at all. Same person?\n\nJohn McCain: No, I think you gotta-- you know, you just have to understand that it's not that you're leaving. It's that you-- that you stayed. I celebrate what a guy who stood fifth from the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy has been able to do. I am so grateful. I-- every night when I go to sleep, I am just filled with gratitude.\n\nLesley Stahl: Since the diagnosis, you've never once had that-- I guess, that feeling in your stomach of--\n\nJohn McCain: Oh, yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: --panic?\n\nJohn McCain: Oh, no. No. I have feelings sometimes of fear of what happens. But as soon as I get that, I say, 'Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You've been around a long time, old man. You've had a great life. You've had a great experience.' I want-- I want-- when I leave, that the ceremony is at the Naval Academy.

"The NRA recruitment video that is even upsetting gun owners\n“They use their media to assassinate real news,” the woman’s voice says scornfully. “They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.”\n\nIt may sound like an excerpt from North Korean state television railing against the evil Americans and their corrupt democracy on the far side of the Pacific.\n\nA National Rifle Association of America ad, narrated by conservative television host Dana Loesch, stirred controversy online. (National Rifle Association of America)\n\nBut these are the opening lines of a new recruitment video by the National Rifle Association of America that is headlined by conservative television host Dana Loesch. The Blaze personality and NRA spokeswoman doesn’t hold back, painting a stark picture of the U.S. political climate that some have interpreted as an ad designed to provoke fear, if not incite violence.\n\nThis new NRA ad is barely a whisper shy of a call for full civil war. https://t.co/N33s2KyvVz — Jeff Sharlet (@JeffSharlet) June 28, 2017\n\nThe video is just over one minute long, but it has generated more than 3.3 million views, thousands of comments and shares, and lots of controversy.\n\n[On the Trump Internet, an incident like the baseball practice shooting has long been a foregone conclusion]\n\n“I’m an old white guy and a life member, but this BS is disgusting,” Facebook user Eric Eugene Rush commented under the post. “When you spew crap like this, you don’t speak for me anymore. I try to avoid doing things on the spur of the moment, but I’ll be thinking about canceling my membership.”\n\n“Jeeeeesus … it almost looks like you’re encouraging violence against demonstrators,” Steve van der Lacy wrote. “Just let the police do their jobs when or if protests get out of hand.”\n\nThe video elicited a strong reaction from Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, who called the video “an open call to violence to protect white supremacy.”\n\nThis NRA ad is an open call to violence to protect white supremacy.

No one called for guns. You owe an apology for trying to purposefully incite with such impugnation. https://t.co/Z7xSiBl6Qe — Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) June 29, 2017\n\nCritics released a petition calling for Facebook to remove the video, which the petition refers to as “inflammatory.”\n\n“All we have to do is look at the increase in violence since the election to see how unchecked violent rhetoric has real life consequences,” the petition states. “Letting this disturbing video stay on Facebook would be extremely irresponsible and could very well lead to disastrous repercussions.”\n\n“The video tries to create an ‘us-vs-them’ narrative and pit Americans against one another,” the petition, which has garnered about 10,500 signatures, adds. “It paints liberals as liars and as violent, unruly protesters who law-abiding gun owners need protection from.”\n\nIn the ad, Loesch accuses “their” ex-president of endorsing “the resistance,” a movement of demonstrators who “smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports — bully and terrorize the law-abiding.”\n\n“The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country, and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth,” Loesch concludes. “I’m the National Rifle Association of America and I’m freedom’s safest place.”\n\nIf Loesch’s rhetoric is an attempt to draw battles lines and stoke outrage, she’s feeding into a clearly-defined narrative that exists among right-wing websites on the Internet, one that views a clash between conservatives and liberals in almost prophetic terms.\n\nAfter James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on Congress members at a baseball practice in Alexandria, Va., wounding five — including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) — some far-right websites used the shooting as an opportunity to advance the sense of impending doom, according to Washington Post reporter Abby Ohlheiser.\n\n“Within an hour, Infowars.com had published a story headlined, ‘LEFTIST GUNMAN SHOOTS REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN IN MEDIA-INSPIRED TERROR ATTACK,'” Ohlheiser wrote. “The gunman had not yet been publicly identified when the story was published, nor had his motivation or political views.”\n\n“We have been warning for months that the mainstream media’s hysterical anti-Trump narrative and the left’s insistence that Trump is illegitimate will radicalize demented social justice warriors and prompt them to lash out with violence,” Infowars’s Paul Joseph Watson wrote in the article. “It looks like that’s exactly what happened today. The blood is on their hands.”\n\nMore recently, conservatives including Newt Gingrich and Eric Trump have criticized what they have called “an increasing hostility on the left,” in clashes at Berkeley, Calif., and Portland, Ore., and from celebrities such as Kathy Griffin.\n\nOn the NRA’s Facebook page, one user said the “biggest problem” fueling the impending violence narrative is “the idea of ‘Team’ politics — Red vs Blue.”\n\n“We need to stop believing that our chosen ‘Team’ will always do what is right,” Albert Stroh wrote. “Start researching your elected politicians.

"Loss of Fertile Land Fuels ‘Looming Crisis’ Across Africa\nBut as the population rises, with more siblings competing for their share of the family farm, the slices are getting thinner. In many parts of Africa, average farm size is just an acre or two, and after repeated divisions of the same property, some people are left trying to subsist on a sliver of a farm that is not much bigger than a tennis court.\n\nA changing climate makes things even harder. Scientists say large stretches of Africa are drying up, and they predict more desertification, more drought and more hunger. In a bad year, maybe one country in Africa will be hit by famine. This year, famine is stalking three, pushing more than 10 million people in Somalia, Nigeria and South Sudan to the brink of starvation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut much of Africa’s farmland is in danger for another, perhaps simpler, reason: overuse. Fast-growing populations mean that many African families can’t afford to let land sit fallow and replenish. They have to take every inch of their land and farm or graze it constantly. This steadily lowers the levels of organic matter in the soil, making it difficult to grow crops.\n\nIn many areas, the soil is so dried out and exhausted that there is little solace even when the prayed-for rains finally come. The ground is as hard as concrete and the rain just splashes off, like a hose spraying a driveway.\n\n“There are going to be some serious food-security issues,” said Zachary Donnenfeld, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. “More and more countries will be reliant on food imports. You’ll increasingly see the international community come into more rescue-type situations.”\n\nThe fact that several of Africa’s biggest economies have grown impressively in the past 10 years may seem like an answer, but analysts say the newfound affluence may actually compound these pressures.\n\nAs people gain wealth, they consume more — more energy, more water and usually more meat, all of which intensify the pressures on the environment. In Kenya, a piece of meat is one of the first things people treat themselves to when they get a little extra cash, and as the nation’s economy grows, so does the taste for beef. Cows have always been a traditional form of wealth; now they’re big business. In the past 15 years, the number of cows in Kenya has shot up by more than 60 percent to around 20 million, driving a scramble for grazing lands.\n\nSome parts of Kenya are now so overgrazed by cows and goats that all the grass roots have been eaten, leaving large stretches of bare earth, as measured by NASA satellite imagery that tracks net levels of carbon dioxide absorption. Herders from bare-earth zones in Kenya are often the ones invading ranches.\n\nPrivate investors are tramping in as well. Since the 1990-2005 period, global food prices have increased by 50 to 75 percent. Many foreign companies and local businesspeople have speculated that despite soil degradation, African farmland is destined to become more valuable. Small landholders across the continent are increasingly getting priced out or even evicted to make way for big commercial farms. This has led to conflict even in usually peaceful places, like Malawi, where a land-defense movement recently started to fight back against foreign-owned tea plantations.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/world/africa/africa-climate-change-kenya-land-disputes.html","1501300800.0"
"Metal recyclers prepare for electric car revolution\nLONDON (Reuters) - Recycling companies are honing processes to extract metals from old batteries more cheaply and efficiently so they can capitalize on an expected shortfall in materials such as cobalt and lithium when sales of electric cars take off.\n\nAn employee sorts used primary non-rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries before being recycled by the German recycling firm Accurec in Krefeld, Germany, November 16, 2017. Picture taken November 16, 2017. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe main obstacle recyclers face now is a shortage of spent batteries to recycle to make their technology cost-effective, but those at the forefront of the industry are confident the supply, and profits, will come.\n\n“The value of lithium carbonate and natural or synthetic graphite has doubled or tripled in the last three or four years, becoming the most valuable materials besides cobalt in the automotive battery,” Albrecht Melber, co-managing director of German recycling firm Accurec, said.\n\n“There are big values that can be recycled in the future.”\n\nElectric vehicle sales are expected to pass 14 million a year by 2025 from less than a million now, fuelling a surge in the consumption of battery materials.(Graphic - Electric vehicles on the rise: tmsnrt.rs/2eNwQoZ)\n\nData specialist Benchmark Mineral Intelligence predicts the industry will need an extra 30,000 tonnes of cobalt and 81,000 tonnes of lithium a year to meet demand by 2021.\n\nCommodity research group CRU expects 11,600 tonnes of cobalt to come from recycling in 2021, up from 7,110 a year now, and 24,900 tonnes by 2026, accounting for 9.7 percent and 17.9 percent of the total market supply respectively.\n\nIn China, where electric vehicle sales topped half a million last year, recyclers are getting ready to deal with a mountain of battery waste and others also see opportunities.\n\n“A 1,000-pound lithium cobalt battery contains about $6,000 worth of cathode material at the top end of the value chain and about $1,700 for a nickel-cobalt-aluminum battery at the low end,” said Larry Reaugh, chief executive of Canadian metals recycler American Manganese (AMY.V).\n\n“If this equated to mining you would have a very high grade feedstock,” he said. “We’re mining batteries, you might say.”\n\nCOBALT PRESSURE\n\nMost electric cars are powered by lithium NMC batteries which use a cathode composed of nickel, manganese and cobalt and a graphite anode.\n\nMining enough cobalt to meet demand is a particular concern as most of the world’s supplies come from Democratic Republic of Congo, where mining areas are prone to conflict. The price of cobalt COB-CATH-LON has more than doubled so far this year.\n\n(Graphic - Demand for battery materials: reut.rs/2zzGHaG)\n\nSupplies of lithium, mainly mined in Chile, are under far less pressure at the moment and new production is due to come on stream in Argentina and Australia.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nBut concern the supply of lithium in battery-ready form will struggle to keep pace with electric car sales has pushed prices up more than 30 percent to a record $12,000 a tonne this year.\n\nBesides a shortage of old batteries to recycle, companies also face challenges extracting lithium in a reusable form.\n\nMost recyclers heat old batteries to high temperatures to retrieve metals, a process known as pyrometallurgy. But this generally only yields cobalt, and sometimes nickel, while lithium is more difficult and expensive to extract.\n\nThe cost of recycling varies widely, but to be economical, CRU estimates it would need to be transformed back into lithium carbonate at a maximum cost of $7,000 a tonne.\n\nFor now, lithium usually ends up in waste slag, which can be used as a building material, or is thrown away. But with the price of all these metals rising, that picture may change.\n\nMATERIAL MATRIX\n\nTechnological advances are key to retrieving more waste metal from batteries and some companies say they have developed ways to get lithium that will come into their own once there’s a steady supply of spent batteries to recycle.\n\nUmicore (UMI.BR) uses a combination of pyrometallurgy and a chemical process known as hydrometallurgy to retrieve lithium and rare earths from slag, as well as extracting cobalt, nickel, and copper.\n\n“A battery is a complex material matrix,” Umicore says. “However, our process allows (us) to separate and concentrate the lithium in one process step, and yields alloys with cobalt, nickel and copper.”\n\nUmicore operates a pilot plant with a 7,000-tonne capacity that can process some 35,000 electric vehicle batteries a year.\n\nAnalysts say the Belgian company, a well-established materials recycler, is by far the most developed lithium ion battery processor in Europe.\n\n“For investors to play the recycling theme, for now the best way is Umicore,” said Tobias Bischoff, a portfolio manager at de Pury Pictet Turrettini & Cie who advises NSF Wealth Management’s Global New Mobility fund.\n\nU.S. company Retriev Technologies has been recycling lithium ion batteries at its plant in Trail, British Columbia, since 2002, recovering cobalt, nickel and copper. It expanded a facility in Ohio to process lithium ion batteries two years ago.\n\nBetween 2012 and the end of last year production at its Trail facility doubled, with the plant processing about 1,200 tonnes of batteries. The company expects growth at a similar rate over the next five years, vice president Todd Coy said.\n\nOther companies are also pushing into lithium ion battery recycling. Accurec now has a 1,000-tonne capacity demonstration plant for recycling car batteries at its Krefeld facility in western Germany, though it says volumes remain small.\n\nAustralia’s Neometals (NMT.AX) is building a pilot plant in Montreal, aiming to develop processes tested in laboratories and small-scale plants for extracting cobalt, lithium and nickel.\n\nAlso in Canada, American Manganese says it can retrieve 100 percent of the lithium - as well as cobalt, nickel, manganese and aluminum - from batteries, using technology originally developed to process low-grade manganese ores.\n\nIt has completed a proof of concept for its process and has a patent pending. A pilot plant is the next step.\n\nSECOND LIFE\n\nBut commercial development for recyclers is tough without the economies of scale that will come with a greater supply of spent batteries. Retriev, for example, says large volumes will be key to developing lithium recycling using hydrometallurgy.\n\n“At current commodity prices we need approximately 4,000 tonnes per year of batteries to justify the estimated capital costs,” Retriev’s Coy said, more than three times its current processing volumes.\n\n“We are confident this volume will be coming in the future - beyond 2023 - but the market is not there yet.”\n\nWhile electronic car sales are growing fast, lithium ion car batteries last eight to 10 years on average, meaning it will be the best part of a decade before significant numbers are spent.\n\nAmerican Manganese’s Reaugh says it is planning to focus initially on recycling material from faulty batteries to get around the wait for working batteries to expire.\n\nEven when they do, battery makers say many will have a second life as grid storage, potentially for the best part of another decade. German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE), for example, says its batteries are specifically designed for that purpose.\n\nGrid storage systems use batteries no longer performing at levels to power cars to store electricity which can be used to even out fluctuations in supply and demand.\n\nStill, not everyone is convinced grid storage will put the brakes on recycling.\n\n“At the end of the day it’s going to come down to whether the raw materials in the battery are worth more than the battery as grid storage,” CRU analyst George Heppel said. “I think there will be a better incentive to recycle the materials, and from there build a more efficient battery with new technology.”\n\nUmicore says it expects volumes of spent batteries to rise above 100,000 tonnes a year in the next decade, with “massive volumes” coming onto the market around 2025. Once that happens, the opportunities for recyclers to capitalize will take off.\n\n“It definitely is a market that could become materially important,” said portfolio manager Bischoff. “We’ve looked at it, and we’ll look at it again.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-batteries-recycling-analysis/metal-recyclers-prepare-for-electric-car-revolution-idUSKBN1DH1DS","1510934136.0"
"Gun owners are outraged by the Philando Castile case. The NRA is silent.\nProtesters marched in St. Paul and Minneapolis on June 16 after the acquittal of the Minn. officer who fatally shot Philando Castile. Activists ultimately shut down one of the main interstate highways in Minnesota. (The Washington Post)\n\nAmid the national fury over the death of Philando Castile at a traffic stop in July — a shooting made more horrific by his girlfriend’s Facebook Live broadcast of his final moments — some condemned the National Rifle Association’s near silence on the matter.\n\nThe organization had been quick to defend other gun owners who made national news. Castile had a valid permit for his firearm, reportedly told the officer about the gun to avoid a confrontation, and was fatally shot anyway after being told to hand over his license.\n\nSo some NRA members were furious when the organization released a tepid statement more than a day after the shooting that merely called it “troublesome” and promised that “the NRA will have more to say once all the facts are known.”\n\nA year later, the investigation is over, and many more facts are known. Police recordings and court records confirmed initial reports that Castile had tried to defuse the situation, assuring the officer that he wasn’t reaching for his weapon.\n\nOn Friday, a jury acquitted the officer, Jeronimo Yanez, of manslaughter.\n\nOn Tuesday, video of the traffic stop was made public, showing Castile calmly telling the officer about his firearms — followed within seconds by the officer shooting him and cursing in what sounds like a panic.\n\nSo outrage is boiling again.\n\nAnd still the NRA has nothing to say.\n\n[The NRA’s internal split over Philando Castile]\n\n“We don’t want the NRA to be just for old white guys,” a member of the gun group wrote this week on Hot Air — one of several right-leaning outlets upset with the organization’s failure to speak out on Castile. “It needs to represent everyone who supports and defends the Second Amendment and stays on the right side of the law.”\n\nThe Washington Post couldn’t find any statement from the NRA about the verdict or video in Castile’s case, and the organization has not responded to requests for comment since Sunday.\n\nPhillip Smith, who leads the National African American Gun Association, said he hasn’t seen any NRA statements since July.\n\n“And I’ve been reading pretty diligently,” he said. “It troubles me tremendously when I see a young man following the rules, doing what he’s supposed to be doing, and there’s still no accountability from a legal perspective.”\n\nAs an @NRA member, I agree that the NRA should speak out on the Philandro Castile shooting. This is a travesty. — Jazz Shaw (@JazzShaw) June 20, 2017\n\nThe Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop was acquitted on all charges by a jury on June 16, nearly a year after his death. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nThe chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus told the Associated Press that the jury had effectively told African Americans that “the Second Amendment does not apply to them.”\n\nA writer for Slate also received no response from the NRA when he wrote about the officer’s acquittal, prompting him to write: “If Castile had been white instead of black, the NRA would have been rallying behind him and his family since the moment of his death, and fundraising off his memory for the rest of time.”\n\nThe group also ignored requests for comment from the Guardian, the outlet wrote — though it tracked down a prominent black gun rights activist, a traditional defender of the NRA, who wrote after the verdict: “Covert racism is a real thing and is very dangerous.”\n\nColion Noir told the Guardian he was speaking only for himself, not the NRA.\n\n[Minn. officer acquitted in shooting of Philando Castile during traffic stop, dismissed from police force]\n\nA year ago, the NRA’s own members were calling out the organization, as Brian Fung wrote for The Post. “What do I pay fees for if you do not represent gun owners and our rights?” one wrote on the group’s Facebook page.\n\nAs described in a criminal complaint from Yanez’s trial, the first moments of Castile’s traffic stop ring true to Smith’s experience as a black gun owner.\n\n“Black men are feared in this country,” he said. “They put their hands on their gun and say, ‘Don’t make any sudden movements.’ ”\n\nSmith said he knows the unspoken rules of any police encounter — rules that go beyond laws and constitutional rights.\n\n“Definitely don’t move at all,” he said, keep your hands on the steering wheel, “take baby steps with the officer until they’re comfortable.”\n\nIn Castile’s case, according to the complaint, he told Yanez, “I’m not pulling it out” — a few seconds before the officer drew his own gun and killed Castile.\n\n“We should all carry a gun now,” Smith said. “We all have that right. We’re not going to let a rogue officer or a rogue legal decision sway us.”\n\nRamsey County Attorney John Choi calls for calm after a jury found police officer Jeronimo Yanez, who fatally shot black motorist Philando Castile during a traffic stop last year, not guilty of second-degree manslaughter. (Reuters)\n\nAnger about the officer’s acquittal has managed to unite critics from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum.\n\nThe National Review’s David French, for instance, once wrote that “it’s hard to recall a political movement built on more verifiable lies and misinformation than Black Lives Matter.”\n\nBut after the Yanez verdict, French’s opinion matched that of Black Lives Matter protesters. He wrote of the officer: “Whether he panicked because of race, simply because of the gun, or because of both, he still panicked, and he should have been held accountable.”\n\nHe added: “The jury’s verdict was a miscarriage of justice.”\n\nAnd still, nothing from the normally vocal NRA, which once released a statement two days after a mass shooting in Orlando: “Destroy radical Islam, not the right of law-abiding Americans to protect themselves.”\n\nThe 2nd Amendment was GROSSLY violated in this #PhilandoCastile. Where are you NRA? These ppl could care less about the constitution — Tariq Nasheed (@tariqnasheed) June 16, 2017\n\nBut nothing is clear cut when it comes to guns and race in the United States, said Nicholas Johnson, who lectures on both at Fordham Law School, wrote a book called “Negroes and the Gun,” and is a black gun owner.\n\nThe NRA has championed black gun rights heroes before, Johnson notes — such as Otis McDonald, who fought Chicago’s handgun ban.\n\nIn return, he said, the group was accused of exploiting civil rights issues.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, gun owners were still “perceived to be kind of an odd minority” within the black community — not exactly a constituency worth angering police over.\n\n“Your political calculation, I think, at the NRA is: Okay, so we can come to the rhetorical aid of a moderately despised contingent of a minority that already doesn’t like us,” Johnson said. “What’s the upside?”\n\nKatie Zezima contributed to this report, which was originally published on June 18 and has been updated.\n\nMore reading:\n\nThe Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings in 2017\n\nPhilando Castile was an adored school cafeteria manager\n\nMinn. police officer who shot Philando Castile was model student, educator says","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/18/some-gun-owners-are-disturbed-by-the-philando-castile-verdict-the-nra-is-silent/","1497758400.0"

"Thousands of ICE detainees claim they were forced into labor, a violation of anti-slavery laws\n\n\nAn arrest is made during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforcement operation in Los Angeles on Feb. 7. (Charles Reed/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Associated Press)\n\nTens of thousands of immigrants detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were forced to work for $1 day, or for nothing at all — a violation of federal anti-slavery laws — a lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2014 against one of the largest private prison companies in the country, reached class-action status this week after a federal judge’s ruling. That means the case could involve as many as 60,000 immigrants who have been detained.\n\nIt’s the first time a class-action lawsuit accusing a private U.S. prison company of forced labor has been allowed to move forward.\n\n“That’s obviously a big deal; it’s recognizing the possibility that a government contractor could be engaging in forced labor,” said Nina DiSalvo, executive director of Towards Justice, a Colorado-based nonprofit group that represents low-wage workers, including undocumented immigrants. “Certification of the class is perhaps the only mechanism by which these vulnerable individuals who were dispersed across the country and across the world would ever be able to vindicate their rights.”\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is the Denver Contract Detention Facility, a 1,500-bed center in Aurora, Colo., owned and operated by GEO Group under a contract with ICE. The Florida-based corporation runs facilities to house immigrants who are awaiting their turn in court.\n\n[This company is making millions from America’s broken immigration system]\n\nThe lawsuit, filed against GEO Group on behalf of nine immigrants, initially sought more than $5 million in damages. Attorneys expect the damages to grow substantially given the case’s new class-action status.\n\nThe class-action ruling by U.S. District Judge John Kane means that as many as 60,000 current and former detainees at the detention facility in Aurora are now part of the lawsuit without having to actively join as plaintiffs, said Andrew Free, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the case is a permanent resident of the U.S., and attorneys expect “a significant portion of the class will fit that bill,” Free said.\n\n[In policy review, Homeland Security panel sends mixed message about future of private immigrant detention]\n\nThe original nine plaintiffs claim that detainees at the ICE facility are forced to work without pay — and that those who refuse to do so are threatened with solitary confinement.\n\nSpecifically, the lawsuit claims, six detainees are selected at random every day and are forced to clean the facility’s housing units. The lawsuit claims that the practice violates the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which prohibits modern-day slavery.\n\n“Forced labor is a particular violation of the statute that we’ve alleged,” Free said. “Whether you’re calling it forced labor or slavery, the practical reality for the plaintiffs is much the same. You’re being compelled to work against your will under the threat of force or use of force.”\n\nGEO Group also is accused of violating Colorado’s minimum wage laws by paying detainees $1 day instead of the state’s minimum wage of about $9 an hour. The company “unjustly enriched” itself through the cheap labor of detainees, the lawsuit says.\n\nNone of the original nine plaintiffs are still detained at the facility, DiSalvo said.\n\nICE’s Denver Contract Detention Facility. (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\n\nThe class-action ruling by Kane, a senior judge in the U.S. District Court in Colorado, came at a critical time, DiSalvo said, noting President Trump’s pledge to deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants. Advocates say private prison companies that have government contracts stand to benefit significantly from the president’s hard-line policy of detaining and deporting a massive number of immigrants\n\n“That means you need to round up and detain more people in order to determine whether they have the rights to stay in this country before you deport them,” DiSalvo said. “More people could be moving through, not just in the Aurora facility. More people could be subjected to GEO’s forced labor policy.”\n\nThe Trump administration on Feb. 21 issued guidelines strengthening enforcement against illegal immigration but insisted that it isn't seeking 'mass deportations.' (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nNotably, the stocks of the two biggest private prison operators, Geo Group and CoreCivic (formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America), have surged since Trump’s election. The companies donated a total of $500,000 to Trump’s inaugural festivities, USA Today reported. Since Trump took office, his administration has reversed the Obama administration’s policy to end the country’s reliance on private prisons.\n\nGEO Group has strongly denied the lawsuit’s allegations and argued in court records that pay of $1 a day does not violate any laws.\n\n“We intend to continue to vigorously defend our company against these claims,” GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez said in a statement. “The volunteer work program at immigration facilities as well as the wage rates and standards associated with the program are set by the Federal government. Our facilities, including the Aurora, Colo. Facility, are highly rated and provide high-quality services in safe, secure, and humane residential environments pursuant to the Federal Government’s national standards.”\n\nJennifer D. Elzea, acting press sectrary for ICE, said she couldn’t comment on the litigation because “ICE is not specifically a party in this suit.”\n\nUnder ICE’s Voluntary Work Program, detainees sign up to work and are paid $1 a day. The nationwide program, ICE says, “provides detainees opportunities to work and earn money while confined, subject to the number of work opportunities available and within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”\n\n[Trump touts recent immigration raids, calls them a ‘military operation’]\n\nDetainees work for up to eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, cleaning bathrooms, showers, toilets, windows, patient rooms and staff offices, waxing floors, and preparing and serving meals. ICE says detainees “shall be able to volunteer for work assignments but otherwise shall not be required to work, except to do personal housekeeping.”\n\nJacqueline Stevens, who runs Northwestern University’s Deportation Research Clinic, said the program does not meet the criteria for what qualifies as volunteer work under labor laws.\n\n“Just slapping the word ‘volunteer’ in front of ‘work program’ doesn’t exempt the prison firm from paying legally mandated wages any more than McDonald’s can use ‘volunteer’ senior citizens and pay them Big Macs,” said Stevens, whose research about the volunteer work program prompted the lawsuit.\n\nPrison labor, Stevens added, has two purposes: to punish prisoners after they’ve been convicted of a crime and to rehabilitate them.\n\nThose don’t apply to immigrant detainees, she said.\n\n“There’s no ostensible purpose to rehabilitate them,” Stevens said. “They’re just waiting for a court date in order to clarify their immigration status. Some don’t end up being deported.”\n\nFree, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, said there are alternatives to detaining immigrants while they wait for their day in court. That includes supervision programs and community monitoring.\n\n“That’s much cheaper than spending double the current cost of detention,” Free said, adding that not incarcerating them would ensure they’re able to find attorneys and attend their immigration hearings. “The for-profit prisons are a policy choice against due process in immigration courts and against access to counsel and against positive outcomes to immigrants who have valid claims.”\n\nIn 2014, GEO Group filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing in court records that Colorado’s minimum wage law does not apply to immigrant detainees.\n\n“Detainees are not whom the minimum wage laws were intended to protect. The minimum wage law was enacted in Colorado to ensure wages are adequate to ‘supply the necessary cost of living and to maintain the health of workers so employed,'” the attorneys argued, quoting the state statute.\n\n[Justice Department will again use private prisons]\n\nThe company further argued that the Trafficking Victims Protection Act is inapplicable because the law is meant to prevent human trafficking of people for labor and/or sex. GEO Group, the attorneys wrote, “did not traffic Plaintiffs in the Aurora facility with the purpose of putting them to work.” They added that the detainees are in the custody of immigration officials.\n\nIn 2015, Kane, the federal judge, partially denied the motion to dismiss. Although he agreed with GEO Group that Colorado’s minimum wage law is inapplicable, he ruled that the other claims can stand.\n\n“GEO’s argument was, ‘Even if we are forcing people to work under threat of solitary confinement, that would be allowed,'” DiSalvo said. “And the judge said, ‘No it wouldn’t be.'”\n\nKane granted class-action status a few days after the Justice Department directed the Bureau of Prisons to, again, use private prisons, a significant shift from the Obama-era policy of significantly reducing — and ultimately ending — their use.\n\nIn a one-paragraph memo last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the previous directive to the Bureau of Prisons to either reduce or decline to renew private-prison contracts as they came due, The Washington Post’s Matt Zapotosky reported.\n\n“The memorandum changed long-standing policy and practice, and impaired the Bureau’s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system,” Sessions wrote. “Therefore, I direct the Bureau to return to its previous approach.”\n\nThe original directive from the Obama administration did not apply to immigration detainees.\n\n1 of 83 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × A look at President Trump’s first 100 days View Photos The beginning of the president’s term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nAfter years of spending cutbacks in Europe and a heavy reliance on the United States through the NATO alliance, France and Germany hope the accord, to be signed on Nov. 13 in Brussels, will tie nations into tighter defense collaboration covering troops and weapons.\n\nThe Permanent Structured Cooperation, or PESCO, could be the biggest leap in EU defense policy in decades and may go some way to matching the bloc’s economic and trade prowess with a more powerful military.\n\nBut differences remain between Paris and Berlin over what countries legally bound by the pact should do, EU diplomats said.\n\nFrance wanted a core group of governments to bring money and military assets to PESCO as well as a willingness to intervene abroad. Germany has sought to broaden the pact to make it inclusive, which some experts say could make it less effective.\n\n“This has to bring about a higher level of commitment if it is going to work,” said a EU official, describing PESCO as a ‘defense marriage’. “The EU already has plenty of forums for discussion,” the official said.\n\nSo far France, Germany, Italy, Spain and around 16 other EU countries have pledged to join the pact, which could formally be launched when EU leaders meet in December. Some other members, including Denmark, Portugal, Malta and Ireland, have yet to commit themselves publicly.\n\nBut it was clear that Britain, which intends to leave the bloc following the Brexit referendum of June 2016, would not participate, officials said. Britain has long sought to block EU defense cooperation, fearing it could result in an EU army.\n\nFrench diplomats said the pact would have several areas where EU governments would agree to work together and pledge funds, including EU military operations, investment and acquiring defense capabilities together as a group.\n\nA German official said the initiative won momentum from French President Emmanuel Macron’s call for a European intervention force in September and U.S. President Donald Trump’s insistence that Europe do more for its security.\n\nProposals for PESCO include work on a European medical command and a network of logistic hubs in Europe, creation of a crisis response center, and joint training of military officers.\n\nA key goal is to reduce the numbers of weapons systems and prevent duplication to save money and improve joint operations.\n\nIt could also serve as an umbrella for projects such as a Franco-German initiative to design a new fighter jet, and existing bilateral military cooperation agreements, such as the close ties between Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nMILITARY “SCHENGEN”\n\nEfforts under the pact will be closely coordinated with the U.S.-led NATO alliance to ensure transparency and avoid any redundancies, the German official said.\n\nOne area where NATO and EU officials see common ground is in the need for a military zone for free movement of troops and equipment, loosely based on the EU’s passport-free travel “Schengen” zone.\n\n“I welcome integration to the maximum extent practical. We obviously want to avoid duplication and maximize transparency,” U.S. Air Force General Tod Wolters, NATO Allied Air Commander, told Reuters.\n\nUnder the plans, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would focus on collective defense, while PESCO would ensure a quicker and more efficient EU response to events like the 2014 Ebola crisis in Africa, the official said.\n\n“This will not happen in competition with NATO,” the German official said.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-defence/eu-to-sign-joint-defense-pact-in-show-of-post-brexit-unity-idUSKBN1D81CT","1510161485.0"
"Turd Reich: San Francisco dog owners lay minefield of poo for rightwing rally\n‘I just had this image of alt-right people stomping around in the poop,’ says the organizer of an unusual protest ahead of Saturday’s Patriot Prayer rally\n\nWhen a group of far-right activists come to San Francisco to hold a rally this Saturday, they will be met by peace activists offering them flowers to wear in their hair.\n\nAlso, dog shit. Lots and lots of dog shit.\n\nHundreds of San Franciscans plan to prepare Crissy Field, the picturesque beach in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge where rightwing protest group Patriot Prayer will gather, with a generous carpeting of excrement.\n\nCharlottesville: United Nations warns US over 'alarming' racism Read more\n\n“I just had this image of alt-right people stomping around in the poop,” Tuffy Tuffington said of the epiphany he had while walking Bob and Chuck, his two Patterdale terriers, and trying to think of the best way to respond to rightwing extremists in the wake of Charlottesville. “It seemed like a little bit of civil disobedience where we didn’t have to engage with them face to face.”\n\nTuffington, a 45-year-old artist and designer, created a Facebook event page based on the concept, and the dog owners of San Francisco responded in droves. Many have declared their intention to stockpile their shitpiles for days in advance, then deliver them in bags for the site. (The group is also planning to reconvene on Sunday to “clean up the mess and hug each other”.)\n\nQuick guide What happened at the Charlottesville protests? Show Hide What happened in Charlottesville on 12 August? White nationalists gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest against a plan to remove a statue of Robert E Lee, the Confederacy’s top general in the American civil war. Demonstrators chanted racist statements, carried antisemitic placards and held torches during the “Unite the Right” rally, which was organised by white nationalist Jason Kessler. The march was met by anti-fascist demonstrators, and some skirmishes broke out before James Fields, 20, allegedly ploughed a car into a group of counter-demonstrators. Civil rights activist Heather Heyer, 32, died and others were injured. Fields has been charged with murder.\n\nThe presence of Patriot Prayer, whose “free speech” events in the Pacific north-west have frequently sparked violent street battles, in notoriously liberal San Francisco has city authorities on edge. Elected officials unsuccessfully pressured the National Park Service to deny the group a permit, and the police department is planning to deploy every available officer.\n\nBut for many San Franciscans, an unwelcome visit from members of the “alt-right” is an opportunity to fight back in the spirit of the city by the bay – with flower power, drag queens, a little creativity, and an assist from the animal kingdom.\n\nShannon Bolt, a behavior scientist who works at Crissy Field, intends to confront Patriot Prayer in the spirit of the Summer of Love. “As white supremacists and neo-Nazis gather in our midst, we’ll tune into the love frequency again and meet their hatred with flowers for their hair,” she wrote in a Facebook event description.\n\nIf security forces keep the protest and counter-protest separate, Bolt told the Guardian, “We will have to offer our Flowers Against Fascism to them symbolically.”\n\nThere will also be contingents of clowns, kayakers, cars, and kids – all hoping to use their particular strengths (humor, seaworthiness, the ability to monopolize parking spaces, and cuteness, respectively) to thumb their noses at hate.\n\n“You have a significant number of people who would like to go and punch Nazis, and then you have people who think they should be entirely ignored,” said veteran labor and LGBTQ rights activist Cleve Jones. “In between you have all sorts of creative and crazy ideas. I kind of like that.”\n\nQuick guide What is the 'alt-right'? Show Hide Who coined the term 'alt-right'? The white supremacist Richard Spencer devised the term in 2010. He has described the movement as 'identity politics for white Americans and for Europeans around the world'. What does it stand for? The movement supports extreme rightwing ideologies, including white nationalism – used interchangeably with white supremacism – and antisemitism. It positions itself broadly against egalitarianism, democracy, universalism and multiculturalism. Some 'alt-right' supporters have argued that their hardline, extremist positions are not truly meant, but are a way to disrupt conventional and accepted thinking. Memes, irony and ambiguity are sometimes used in an attempt to wrongfoot critics. How does the 'alt-right' relate to the Trump administration? The Trump administration includes figures who are associated with the 'alt-right', including the former Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, now the White House chief strategist. Many of Trump's policy positions have won favour with the movement.\n\nJones is working with local drag queen Juanita More to host a rally and march for equality beginning at Harvey Milk Plaza in the city’s Castro district. “There’s this desire to create fear,” he said of media coverage showing torch-wielding racists spewing hateful chants. “With these kinds of creative actions, we dispel fear. We say we’re going to fight you and we’re going to have a ball doing it and we’re going to laugh and love each other.”\n\nThe United States was never immune to fascism. Not then, not now | David Motadel Read more\n\nJones is also taking inspiration from the German town of Wunsiedel, where residents have responded to an annual neo-Nazi march by sponsoring an “involuntary walkathon” that raises funds for anti-extremist causes.\n\nHe is raising money for ten local organizations that reflect the diversity of San Francisco, including the Transgender Law Center, Disability Rights and Education Defense Fund, and Muslim Advocates. A similar Wunsiedel-inspired effort has been launched by Jewish Bar Association of San Francisco, which has raised more than $100,000 for the the Southern Poverty Law Center under the banner “Adopt-a-Nazi”.\n\n“When the dust has settled and the smoke has cleared,” Jones said, “I hope that the appearance of rightwing extremists in San Francisco will raise a significant amount of money for the people they seek to harm.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/san-francisco-dog-poo-protest-patriot-prayer-rally","1503547200.0"
"Syrian War Drags On, but Assad’s Future Looks as Secure as Ever\nThese developments do not suggest that Mr. Assad has an easy road ahead. He remains a pariah in much of the world, presiding over a blasted, divided land. If he emerges victorious, he is likely to be left with a weak state that is beholden to foreign powers and lacks the resources to rebuild.\n\nBut his endurance has serious ramifications for the country and for the Middle East, affecting the prospects of Syria’s future stability, of refugees to return home and of the Syrian government to tap international funds to rebuild its destroyed cities.\n\nIt is also a grim, late act in the Arab Spring uprisings that broke out in 2011. While protests and armed insurrections removed from power the leaders of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, Mr. Assad has remained, despite wielding tremendous violence against his people.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Assad himself has acknowledged the toll of the war, but argued that it has purified the state by eliminating threats to the nation and uniting Syrians around a shared project.\n\n“We lost the best of our youth and our infrastructure,” he told a conference in Damascus, Syria’s capital, last month. “It cost us a lot of money and a lot of sweat, for generations. But in exchange, we won a healthier and more homogeneous society in the true sense.”\n\nSyria’s conflict began in 2011 with a popular uprising against Mr. Assad, which his security forces sought to suppress with overwhelming force. The opposition took up arms, and the United States, Saudi Arabia and others endorsed the rebels’ cause, backing them politically and giving them arms and cash.\n\nNow, Mr. Assad has succeeded in dispelling the rebel threat, largely because of the steadfast financial and military support of his foreign backers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis government controls Syria’s largest cities and most of its remaining people, who generally live in better conditions than those elsewhere in the country. His allies — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah — have stood by him, bolstering his depleted military and helping it advance.\n\nThe rebels, a disparate collection of factions with varying ideologies, never managed to form a unified front, or to convince all Syrians that they would create a better future. Extremists linked to Al Qaeda joined their ranks, and their territory has shrunk as their backers have abandoned them to focus on fighting the Islamic State.\n\n“The Syrian regime is now the furthest from being toppled,” said Bassam Alahmad, executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice, a human-rights monitoring group based in Turkey. “Fewer powers are interested in making that happen than was the case near the beginning of the Syrian war.”\n\nBut Mr. Assad is in many ways a limited head of state.\n\nMuch of Syria’s territory remains out of his hands, and foreign powers have carved out spheres of influence, undermining his claim to rule all of Syria.\n\nPhoto\n\nTurkish forces allied with local rebels hold territory in the north, and the United States is working with Kurdish and Arab fighters against the Islamic State in the east.\n\nEven in areas nominally under Mr. Assad’s control, Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and local militias empowered by the war often exercise greater control than the Syrian state. And Russia has taken the lead in Syria’s international diplomacy, negotiating safe zones with foreign powers around the country to try to stop the violence.\n\nThe war’s toll has been tremendous and could be a burden on Mr. Assad and his allies for decades to come.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And while images of Syria’s destroyed cities have become common symbols of the war’s toll, the cost of unseen factors like broken social trust and shattered social networks could outstrip that of the physical damage many times over, Harun Onder, the report’s lead author, said in an interview.\n\n“As the conflict continues, it is not only the physical destruction, but also that the degradation in the social fabric intensifies,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMerely by staying in power, Mr. Assad could hinder reconstruction.\n\nOfficials in the United States and Europe still hope that Mr. Assad will leave office in an eventual political agreement, but they have vowed not to reward him for his brutality and rampant human rights violations if he stays by helping rebuild the country.\n\nOther countries that support Mr. Assad could help, but their resources are limited. Iran and Russia are under international sanctions, their economies hurting from low oil prices.\n\nLast month, the government held an international trade fair in Damascus for the first time since 2011, welcoming companies from Iran, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela and elsewhere. Among the new deals signed were ones for the importation of 200 buses from Belarus and contracts to export 50,000 tons of produce.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Assad’s hold on power could also affect the return of refugees, a critical issue for neighboring states.\n\nAbout half of Syria’s people have been displaced by the war, with more than five million of them seeking refuge abroad. Many fled attacks by Mr. Assad’s forces and have no homes to return to. Others say the situation is not safe or fear arrest or conscription by Mr. Assad’s security forces.\n\nAfter years of living in exile, Bassam al-Malik, a businessman and former member of the main exile opposition group, tried to return to Syria this year to sell off some of his property. Through an intermediary, the government warned him not to return or he would be detained.\n\nNow he was stuck, he said, between “the regime and the opposition.”\n\nSome Syrians have dropped their opposition and made their peace with a government that seems to be winning.\n\nIn 2012, Firas al-Khatib, a star soccer player, told a crowd of screaming fans that he would not play for the Syrian national team “as long as any artillery is shelling any place in Syria.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast month, he returned to Damascus and received a hero’s welcome at the airport. “Today, we are on the land of our homeland and in the service of our homeland,” he said.\n\nThe team, which is closely related to Mr. Assad, is still in the running to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nOther citizens, like the teacher from Madaya, are happy to support anyone who can provide basic security and services.\n\n“We are people who walk where the winds take us,” she said. “During the siege, we were with the revolution.

"A police officer fatally shot a man while responding to an emergency call now called a ‘swatting’ prank\nA police officer in Wichita fatally shot a man while responding to an emergency call that authorities now say was a tragic and senseless prank.\n\nThe 28-year-old man, whom officials did not immediately identify, was killed around 6:20 p.m. Thursday after police responded to a report that there had been a shooting and hostages taken at the house, Deputy Wichita Police Chief Troy Livingston said at a Friday news conference.\n\n“Due to the actions of a prankster, we have an innocent victim,” Livingston said, calling it a case of “swatting.”\n\nTyler Barriss, 25, was arrested on Friday in connection with the case, Los Angeles police told The Washington Post.\n\n[Why a Twitter user claims to have made the ‘swatting’ call that led police to kill a man]\n\nSwatting, which has a long history in the online gaming world, refers to the practice of making an emergency call about a fake situation often involving a killing or hostages, in the hopes of sending police to the address of an adversary or random person.\n\nIn an interview with the Wichita Eagle, the slain man’s family identified him as Andrew Finch, a father of two, and said he was not armed.\n\n“I heard my son scream, I got up and then I heard a shot,” his mother, Lisa Finch, told reporters Friday.\n\n“What gives the cops the right to open fire?” Finch said. “Why didn’t they give him the same warning they gave us? That cop murdered my son over a false report.”\n\n\n\nLisa Finch reacts to the killing of her son Andrew Finch after he was shot Thursday by police in Wichita (Bo Rader/Wichita Eagle, via AP)\n\nThe officer who fired the fatal shot, a seven-year veteran of the force, has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is department policy. Police are investigating the circumstances of the call.\n\nA person who first called the security desk at Wichita City Hall told a 911 operator that he had accidentally shot his father and was pointing a gun at his mother and brother.\n\n“They were arguing and I shot him in the head and he’s not breathing anymore,” the caller said.\n\nThe individual later threatened to set the house on fire, then asked the operator, “Do you have my address correct?”\n\nA man emerged from the house after police arrived. Livingston said police officers repeatedly told him to put his hands up, and one shot when he believed the man was reaching for a weapon. Police said the man was not armed.\n\n[‘Not even funny’: Editor’s markup of Milo Yiannopoulos’s manuscript draws ridicule, ire]\n\nThe officers did not find anyone who had been taken hostage at the location, nor any deceased victims.\n\nThe family members were handcuffed and taken in police cruisers to be interviewed by officers at a station, the Eagle reported.\n\n“The police said, ‘Come out with your hands up,’ ” Lisa Finch told the Eagle. “[The officer] took me, my roommate and my granddaughter, who witnessed the shooting and had to step over her dying uncle’s body.”\n\nThe man was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead at 7 p.m., Livingston said, adding that the caller continued to call 911 after officers had arrived at the scene.\n\nThe incident has drawn speculation, fueled by statements made by individuals on social media, that the emergency call was part of a prank made by a video-gamer in an argument. Swatting has been used as a tactic to harass and intimidate people across the country and is typically done with digital tools that disguise the caller’s location.\n\nIn other cases of apparent swatting, three families in Florida in January had to evacuate their homes after a detective received an anonymous email claiming bombs had been placed at the address.\n\nA 20-year-old Maryland man was shot in the face with rubber bullets by police in 2015 after a fake hostage situation was reported at his home.\n\nRep. Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced an anti-swatting bill in 2015 — then was herself the victim of swatting. Armed officers in 2016 responded to an anonymous call claiming an active shooter was at Clark’s home.\n\nUMG Gaming, which operates online gaming tournaments, said in an email to the Associated Press that the company is “doing everything we can to assist the authorities.”\n\nLivingston said Wichita police have some promising leads.\n\nLisa Finch told the Eagle that her son did not play video games.\n\nAndrew Finch’s aunt Lorrie Hernandez-Caballero told the Eagle she was shocked that a person would make such a prank call.\n\n“How does it feel to be a murderer?” she said. “I can’t believe people do this on purpose.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\n‘The Shed at Dulwich’ was London’s top-rated restaurant.

"'The Stories Are True,' Louis C.K. Says, After Women Described His Sexual Misconduct\n'The Stories Are True,' Louis C.K. Says, After Women Described His Sexual Misconduct\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Gabbe/Getty Images for Tribeca TV Festival Ben Gabbe/Getty Images for Tribeca TV Festival\n\nUpdated at 5:15 p.m. ET\n\nAfter five female comics accused Louis C.K. of inappropriate behavior involving masturbation, the comedian has admitted that the 'stories are true.'\n\nC.K. expressed remorse and said he used his power 'irresponsibly.' His statement, and other elements of this post, contain language some may find offensive.\n\nIn the statement released by his publicist, C.K. said in part: 'At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question. It's a predicament for them.'\n\nRumors have long swirled in the comedy community that C.K. had a pattern of masturbating in front of women who were spending time with him in a professional context, including on sets or otherwise in the workplace.\n\nOn Thursday, The New York Times ran a story that took the allegations out of the world of blind items and gossip blogs and transformed it into a major story with multiple named sources.\n\nTwo comics said C.K. asked to masturbate in front of them after a comedy festival, which they thought was a joke — but then he did it. Another comedian said C.K. asked to masturbate in front of her and, after she rebuffed him, said he had 'issues.' One woman said she heard him masturbating on the phone after she called to invite him to a show of hers; another woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she agreed to watch him masturbate in his office while he was a producer on a TV show where she worked.\n\nC.K.'s statement, released by his publicist, reads in full:\n\n'I want to address the stories told to the New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, Julia who felt able to name themselves and one who did not. 'These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question. It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. 'I have been remorseful of my actions. And I've tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I'm aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. 'I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn't want to hear it. I didn't think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. 'There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with. 'I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work. 'The hardest regret to live with is what you've done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I'd be remiss to exclude the hurt that I've brought on people who I work with and have worked with who's professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I've brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years. 'I've brought pain to my family, my friends, my children and their mother. 'I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen. 'Thank you for reading.'\n\nHBO cut ties with C.K. Thursday night, after the story broke. The distributor of his upcoming film, I Love You, Daddy, has canceled its release, as Deadline reported Friday morning. The movie was slated to come out next week — and, as reviewers noted, contained scenes in which a character mimed masturbation in front of other people. The film's future is unclear, Deadline writes.\n\nAlso separating itself from C.K. is the FX networks: 'We are cancelling the overall deal between FX Productions and his production company, Pig Newton. He will no longer serve as executive producer or receive compensation on any of the four shows we were producing with him — Better Things, Baskets, One Mississippi and The Cops.'\n\nFX adds that it knows of no unprofessional behavior by C.K. on the series he has produced for the company. 'However,' the statement adds, 'now is not the time for him to make television shows. Now is the time for him to honestly address the women who have come forth to speak about their painful experiences, a process which he began today with his public statement.'\n\nReaction to C.K.'s statement was swift.\n\nSeveral women named in the story responded on Twitter, at least obliquely, to C.K.'s stated (and self-admittedly inadequate) defense that he 'asked' before masturbating.\n\n'You asked but we never said yes,' tweeted the account of comedy duo Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov.\n\nAnd Rebecca Corry, who said no when C.K. asked if she would watch him masturbate, retweeted comedy writer Katie Rich's response, 'If a woman wants to see your penis she will tell you.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/10/563316860/louis-c-k-admits-to-sexual-harassment-of-multiple-female-comedians","1510290000.0"
"Trump clashes with German leaders as transatlantic tensions boil over\nUS president uses Twitter to point finger at Berlin amid rebukes from German officials, including Angela Merkel, preparing for election\n\nDonald Trump has escalated a row between the US and Germany in an early morning tweet accusing Berlin of unfair trade relations and not paying its way in the Nato alliance.\n\nTrump’s tweet, declaring German policies “very bad” for the US and vowing to change the situation, came a few hours after the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, declared that the administration’s “short-sighted policies” were weakening the west.\n\nThe discord between the Trump administration and Berlin is just the sorest point in increasingly troubled transatlantic relations, aggravated by the president’s European trip last week. Since then, simmering tensions have boiled over in a public spat.\n\nPlay Video 1:13 Trump urges NATO members to 'pay fair share' – video\n\nTrump’s omission of a clear commitment to collective defence and his harangue of European leaders for their military spending at a Nato summit on Thursday exposed the extent of the rift. A dramatically bad week for western cohesion was capped by his refusal to join six partner states at the G7 summit in Sicily in a commitment to the Paris agreement to combat climate change.\n\n“I thought it was the least effective visit of any American president to Europe since the 1940s,” Nicholas Burns, a former undersecretary of state for political affairs, said. “I couldn’t think of another visit that was so fraught with difficulties, deep substantial division, disregard and disrespect.”\n\nAngela Merkel: EU cannot completely rely on US and Britain any more Read more\n\nIn the summit’s wake, Angela Merkel declared that Europe would have to “take our fate into our own hands” and could not longer depend on leadership from the US.\n\nTrump had been restrained in his use of Twitter during the European tour, but he released a salvo of inflammatory tweets coming out of the Memorial Day long weekend.\n\nHis tweet aimed at Berlin said: “We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change.”\n\nThe president was referring to a commitment made by US allies in 2014 to spend 2% of their GDP on defence. German currently spends 1.2% on its military. That figure is gradually increasing but German leaders acknowledge it is unlikely to reach 2% by the target date in 2024. Merkel argues that spending on development aid and crisis prevention should be included in the figure.\n\nGermany does maintain a substantial trade surplus with the US, driven by its export-led growth. But German officials have repeatedly pointed out to the Trump administration that when it comes to the car industry – which seems to be the focus of the president’s ire – the German firms BMW and Mercedes make most of their cars for the US market in the US, employing thousands of workers and leading US auto exports to the rest of the Americas.\n\nContrary to Trump administration complaints, German authorities have argued against European Central Bank monetary policies that have weakened the euro and made German exports cheaper.\n\nJim Townsend, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for European and Nato policy, said that Trump had needlessly exacerbated a rift between old allies.\n\n“We continue to haemorrhage and we have to staunch that because it’s a self-inflicted wound,” Townsend said.\n\nCriticism of the US by Merkel, of the Christian Democratic Union, and Gabriel, of the Social Democratic party, is likely to have been sharpened by the fact that distance from Washington will play well in the run-up to German elections among voters who are overwhelmingly anti-Trump across the political spectrum.\n\nThe German chancellor’s main rival, the Social Democrats’ leader Martin Schulz, voiced outrage at what he described as Trump’s “humiliating treatment” of Merkel in Brussels. Even in the midst of an election campaign, Schulz said, “the chancellor represents all of us at summits like these, and I reject with outrage the way this man takes it upon himself to treat the head of our country’s government”.\n\nAt a press briefing on Tuesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer attempted to downplay the rift between Trump and Merkel. “They get along very well. He has a lot of respect for her,” said Spicer. “And he views not just Germany but the rest of Europe as an important American ally.”\n\nGerman observers said the spat with Trump had undoubtedly helped Merkel’s campaign, helping present her as a force for stability and rationality in uncertain times.\n\n\n\nTrump's big trip began well – but in Europe his flaws were painfully exposed Read more\n\nMerkel has been able to burnish her credentials as the emerging leader of the democratic world, with a visit by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Tuesday. In remarks cleared aimed towards Washington, where Trump has yet to declare his position on the Paris agreement, Modi said it would be “morally criminal” not to act on climate change, and praised Merkel’s “vision”.\n\nThe Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, is also due to make the trip to Berlin later in the week ahead of Friday’s EU-China summit. Beijing was disappointed by the Trump administration’s failure to send a senior representative to its mid-May summit on its “Belt and Road” global investment initiative.\n\nAdam Thomson, a former British ambassador to Nato and now the director of the European Leadership Network, said transatlantic relations had not quite reached their nadir of 2003, during the George W Bush administration, when France and Germany voted against the US and UK on the UN security council on the Iraq war, but the pervasive sense of drift was getting worse.\n\n“What is different is the leadership,” Thomson said. “Bush’s leadership of the north atlantic alliance was divisive. Obama’s was selective. But it is debatable whether there is any leadership at all under Trump.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/donald-trump-germany-angela-merkel-election","1496116800.0"
"Experts working with Homeland Security hacked into Boeing 757\nThere's some unsettling news about one of America's most widely-used jetliners.\n\nIn a test, experts working with Homeland Security hacked into a Boeing 757. The team of researchers needed only two days in September 2016 to remotely hack into a 757 parked at the airport in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nSpeaking at a conference this week, Robert Hickey of the Department of Homeland Security said his team used 'typical stuff that could get through security' and hacked into the aircraft systems using 'radio frequency communications.'\n\n'The 757 hasn't been in production since 2004, but the aging workhorse is still flown by major airlines like United, Delta and American,' said Mark Rosenker, the former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nPresident Trump's personal jet is a 757. So is the plane Vice President Pence often uses -- including on his recent trip to Texas.\n\nThe classified DHS testing followed a 2015 incident where a passenger told the FBI he had gained control of a plane's engine by hacking into the airline's in-flight entertainment system.\n\nThat same year, the Government Accountability Office warned about 'potential malicious actors' accessing an airliner's Wi-Fi network.\n\nHomeland Security says the recent testing was in an 'artificial environment and risk reduction measures were already in place.'\n\nBoeing observed the testing and was briefed on its results. In a statement, the company says, 'We firmly believe that the test did not identify any cyber vulnerabilities in the 757, or any other boeing aircraft.'\n\nAn official briefed on the testing does not believe it revealed an 'extreme vulnerability' to airliners, since it required a very specific approach in a very specific way on an older aircraft with an older system. The official adds, it was good information to have, 'but I'm not afraid to fly.'","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-hacked-boeing-757-jetliner/","None"
"‘We only kill black people,’ a cop told a woman — on camera. Now he’ll lose his job.\nDash cam video shows a Cobb County officer, who has been identified as police Lt. Greg Abbott, making racist statements to a passenger during a DUI traffic stop in July 2016. (Cobb County Police)\n\nThe Georgia police officer who was captured on camera telling a woman during a traffic stop that law enforcement personnel “only kill black people” says he’ll retire amid the backlash.\n\nLt. Greg Abbott announced his intent to leave the Cobb County Police Department on Thursday, after his superiors told him he would be fired, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\nIt is unclear whether officials would accept Abbott’s resignation or follow through with their plan to terminate him. With nearly 30 years of government service, the distinction could have a profound affect on his retirement benefits. Spokespersons for the police department did not immediately respond to a message from The Washington Post.\n\nDash-cam video shows Abbott standing outside a vehicle during a DUI traffic stop in July 2016. A female passenger can be heard telling the officer that she did not want to put her hands down to reach for her phone because, “I’ve just seen way too many videos of cops —.”\n\n“But you’re not black,” the officer interrupted. “Remember, we only kill black people. Yeah, we only kill black people, right?”\n\n[Police officers in two states accused of mocking Charlottesville violence]\n\nSpeaking at a news conference Thursday, Cobb County Police Chief Mike Register described Abbott as “honorable,” but said the officer had made a mistake, the newspaper reported.\n\n“I don’t know what is in his heart,” the chief added, indicating Abbot would be fired, “but I know what came out of his mouth.”\n\nThe department said Wednesday that Register received information late last week about an officer making “inappropriate racial comments,” which were captured on video obtained by ABC affiliate WSB.\n\nThe Cobb County Police chief says a Georgia police officer who was heard on a dashcam recording during a traffic stop telling a woman that police 'only kill black people' will be fired.

In context, his comments were clearly aimed at attempting to gain compliance by using the passenger’s own statements and reasoning to avoid making an arrest.”\n\nBut the police chief said there was no excuse.\n\n“No matter what the context, statements like these are unacceptable and are not indicative of the type of culture we are trying to facilitate here in the police department, as well as within the county,” Register said in a statement.\n\nSuri Chadha Jimenez, an attorney who represented the driver in the DUI case, said that he had seen the video while preparing for court last summer and was “shocked” by what he had heard.\n\n“I heard that, and I cringed.

"Popular Remington 700 rifle linked to potentially deadly defect\nThe following script is from “The Remington 700,” which aired on Feb. 19, 2017. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Shachar Bar-On, producer. Alexandra Poolos, associate producer.\n\nA federal judge in Missouri heard arguments this past week in a case involving one of the most popular bolt-action rifles in American history: the Remington 700 series. Here’s the problem: thousands of owners have complained these rifles have fired without anyone squeezing the trigger.\n\nThe company has downplayed the danger for decades and the complaints represent only a fraction of the rifles out there. But 10 attorneys general wrote the court saying, “There are potentially as many as 7.5 million defective rifles at issue.” And that, “Remington knows or should know…they are unreasonably dangerous.” One avid hunter and gun-lover is on a mission to raise awareness about what he calls the rifle’s defect. And he has good reason.\n\nCBS News\n\nRoger Stringer: I have become so accustomed to unpleasant thoughts and hardship till that has become my new normal.\n\nOne of Roger Stringer’s sons is dead; the other went to prison.\n\nRoger Stringer: Pain is my constant companion.\n\nFamily photos of better days show dad and sons hunting. Roger, a powerline construction foreman from Enon, Mississippi, owned a Remington Model 700 rifle. And he bought another one for his older, then 12-year-old son, Zac.\n\n“I have become so accustomed to unpleasant thoughts and hardship...that has become my new normal.” Roger Stringer, father\n\nRoger Stringer: We loved the one that I had and he was old enough and mature enough.\n\nLesley Stahl: And how much was the safety stressed?\n\nRoger Stringer: Paramount.\n\nBut one night in 2011, the two boys, Zac and Justin, home alone, got into a fight. Zac, then 15, got his Remington 700.\n\nZac Stringer: And I loaded it. I loaded it with the purpose of scaring him.\n\nLesley Stahl: You knew you weren’t supposed to load the gun in the house.\n\nZac Stringer: Yes, ma’am, I had been-- I had been taught better.\n\nHe says eventually emotions calmed down.\n\nPersonal photo\n\nZac Stringer: And I started to stand up off of the couch and when I-- when I bent at the waist and started up, I heard a click. And it went off. And I remember the fire leaping from the barrel. I remember seeing it hit. It was -- half his head was gone.\n\nPanicking, he says, he went and got Justin’s gun and placed it between his brother’s legs to make it appear as though he had shot himself. Then Zac called his parents.\n\nRoger Stringer: And Zac met me outside and he said, “Daddy, don’t go in there.” And I just pushed him aside and I came on in. And it was really obvious that…\n\nLesley Stahl: It was right here, too.\n\nRoger Stringer: He was right there.\n\nDetectives suspected right away that this wasn’t self inflicted. Zac was arrested the day of Justin’s funeral, and later confessed that it was his gun, but he insisted it went off by itself.\n\nCBS News\n\nZac Stringer: Well, I didn’t know how it had went off.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you deliberately kill your baby brother?\n\nZac Stringer: No, ma’am.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you pull the trigger?\n\nZac Stringer: No, ma’am.\n\nBut Zac was convicted and sent off to prison for 10 years.\n\nLesley Stahl: Is it true that you actually testified against him at trial.\n\nRoger Stringer: I did. I did. Because I’d never heard of a gun going off without a trigger being pulled. It made no sense.\n\nWhat Roger didn’t know was that by then Remington had gotten some 200 complaints claiming just that about rifles like Zac’s, with a trigger mechanism called the X-Mark Pro. Six months after Justin was killed, another tragedy with the same trigger, this time in Chadbourn, North Carolina. 16-year-old Jasmine Thar and her cousin Jahmesha were about to go Christmas shopping.\n\nRobert Chaffin: They were standing out in the front yard, with the grandmother sitting on the porch.\n\nRobert Chaffin, an attorney for Jasmine’s family, made this animation: a neighbor across the street in his bedroom picked up a loaded model 700. The safety was off.\n\nRobert Chaffin: And it fired through a closed window. And in what could be the most random act you ever heard of, the bullet traveled across the street and went through Jahmesha’s chest, barely missing her heart, and basically hit Jasmine almost directly in the heart, and she died in her grandmother’s front yard. That’s an incredibly tragic case.\n\nIn a deposition under oath, James Anthony Blackwell, a former Marine and experienced hunter, couldn’t explain how his rifle went off:\n\nQ: Do you, Anthony Blackwell, believe that you pulled the trigger?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nQ: Do you think you touched it in any way?\n\nA: No, sir.\n\nLesley Stahl: So, was he prosecuted?\n\nRobert Chaffin: No.\n\nChaffin had already won $17 million from Remington in 1994 for a client who shot himself in the foot when he said his 700 fired on its own. Back then rifles were made with another trigger called the Walker. The company has faced 150 lawsuits alleging injury or death related to that trigger, but argues it’s always human error and never the gun’s fault.\n\nLesley Stahl: Has Remington ever admitted wrongdoing?\n\nRobert Chaffin: Never. You cannot admit wrongdoing when you have seven million of these things on the market.\n\nBut according to a Remington internal document the company had evidence of the problem as early as 1975 when its own tests showed some of the model 700s firing without the trigger being pulled. And this 1979 document indicates the company considered a recall. That never happened, but a decade ago it did switch from the original Walker trigger to the X-Mark Pro.\n\nRobert Chaffin: They admit under oath in recent testimony that the new model was brought about to the market because they had so many complaints with the older model, not that there was anything wrong with it. And it turns out the new model was actually worse than the old model for the first eight years they manufactured it.\n\nLesley Stahl: That’s stunning. The X-Mark Pro came out in 2006.\n\nRobert Chaffin: Yes ma’am.\n\nLesley Stahl: How soon after that did Remington start getting complaints?\n\nRobert Chaffin: Soon.\n\nAnd they kept coming: “gun fired when safety was taken off (twice)”… “trigger was not touched.”… Three police departments complained. By early 2010, Remington was getting videos from customers claiming they captured the trigger going off on its own after the safety was released.\n\nVideo: “So you see the rifle did fire.”\n\nVideo: “Never touched the trigger.”\n\nFor years, despite the videos, and testing hundreds of rifles sent to the company, Remington typically marked complaints “could not duplicate” and filed them in a database. And regulators couldn’t do anything because their hands are tied: the government is allowed to recall toy guns, but not real ones.\n\nRobert Chaffin: In the world of firearms there is no such thing as a consumer product agency that can force any firearms makers to recall the gun. Does not exist.\n\nLesley Stahl: ‘Cause of the Second Amendment, correct?\n\nRobert Chaffin: Well, the right to bear arms, yes. Any recall has to be voluntary.\n\nSo the government can recall a toy gun, but not a real one. Then, in February 2014, Remington received this video.\n\nVideo: You’ll notice I’m in my coat –\n\nA Remington owner videotaped an experiment in his garage showing that the spontaneous firing is more likely in cold weather.\n\nVideo: As you can see – it fired.\n\nWith the video all over YouTube, Remington did its own tests in bitter cold: four out of 10 rifles went off. In April 2014, the company fixed the problem, and announced a recall of over 1,300,000 rifles. Yet, and here’s where the critics weigh in, Remington continues to insist no one had been harmed by the X-Mark Pro defect. It says that even after settling the case over Jasmine Thar’s death.\n\nLesley Stahl: Jasmine’s family sued Remington.\n\nRobert Chaffin: Yes, they did.\n\nLesley Stahl: And how much did they sue for?\n\nRobert Chaffin: They sued for over $100 million. I cannot tell you the terms of the settlement.\n\nLesley Stahl: And in that settlement as all the others Remington admits no wrongdoing—\n\nRobert Chaffin: True.\n\nLesley Stahl: -and gets the silence of everybody.\n\nRobert Chaffin: True. It’s a critical part of it.\n\nChaffin says that even when Remington offers to fix the triggers, they do too little to notify gun owners. The company declined our request for an on camera interview but in a statement told us they “broadly promoted and advertised” the recall. Yet almost three years in, only about 1 in 4 of the rifles has been fixed; nearly a million remain out there.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think there are people with this gun, with this trigger mechanism, watching us right now saying, “Whoa! I have that gun.”\n\nRobert Chaffin: This’ll be the first time they ever heard of it.\n\nAnd there’s still the issue of the original, Walker trigger that remains in millions of rifles. Remington keeps getting complaints: nearly 2,000 in the past four years alone. It’s also facing a class-action lawsuit in which owners of guns with the Walker claim the company knowingly sold them a defective product.\n\nRemington agreed to settle, offering to replace the triggers for free, even though it “vehemently denies… there is any design defect in the Walker.” A judge has yet to approve the settlement. Todd Hilsee, an expert on class-action notices, says the company is confusing its customers by burying the danger.\n\nTodd Hilsee: No highlighting of “Stop using your gun; it might kill someone.”\n\nLesley Stahl: What do they say?\n\nTodd Hilsee: They say, “We deny there’s a problem. We deny any wrongdoing.”\n\nLesley Stahl: There’s nothing wrong with this gun, but let’s—\n\nTodd Hilsee: But we’re willing to fix it.\n\nAmplifying his point, 10 attorneys general wrote the judge, chastising Remington for refusing to “acknowledge responsibility for the harm caused by its defective triggers.”\n\nLesley Stahl: If everyone turns their guns in, how much would this cost Remington to fix the problem?\n\nTodd Hilsee: The value would be $487 million.\n\nLesley Stahl: Half a billion dollars.\n\nTodd Hilsee: Half a billion dollars.\n\nIn Mississippi, Roger Stringer knew nothing about the class action lawsuit or the recall. He was visiting Zac in prison as often as he could and Zac kept telling him that he never pulled the trigger so one day in 2015, Roger picked up his iPhone:\n\nRoger Stringer: I googled “Remington Model 700, spontaneous firing.”\n\nLesley Stahl: And?\n\nRoger Stringer: I just about dropped the phone when all that stuff showed up. I mean, there was just mountains and mountains of information about those guns; story after story of it happening to other people.\n\nHe called Remington and found out Zac’s rifle with the X-Mark Pro was under recall. That rifle is still being held at the local courthouse. A state forensic expert did test it before the trial, but Hal Kittrell, the prosecutor in the case, says he didn’t know there had been other instances of the gun going off by itself.\n\nLesley Stahl: If you had known about this issue with the gun, the trigger problem, would you have gone ahead with the trial, things may have gone differently?\n\nHal Kittrell: I say this, Lesley, I mean, had we known that there was a problem with the trigger before we were getting ready for trial, I can assure you we would’ve looked into that. We would’ve assessed this case based on that evidence, there’s no question about that.\n\nShortly after we approached the prison to interview Zac, Roger unexpectedly got word that after five years behind bars, his son would be released for good behavior. Roger now believes his son is innocent and says he will soon ask the Mississippi Supreme Court to reconsider Zac’s conviction. He’s also written to the judge in the class-action case asking him to hold Remington’s feet to the fire.\n\nCBS News\n\nRoger Stringer: What I’m pushing for is for nobody else to have to walk in my shoes. I don’t want anybody else to have to see their baby in the shape Justin was in that night.\n\nLesley Stahl: What would you like to see Remington do now?\n\nRoger Stringer: Eliminate the danger that is lurking in so many households.\n\nLesley Stahl: Some people are gonna say that it’s convenient to blame Remington. In other words, what if you’re wrong about Zac?\n\nRoger Stringer: There are going to be naysayers. I accept that. I welcome another day in court. But let’s do it with all the facts. I’m ready for it. Bring it on.\n\nRemington provided 60 Minutes with the following statement:","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/popular-remington-700-rifle-linked-to-potentially-deadly-defects/","None"
"China to plow $361 billion into renewable fuel by 2020\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China will plow 2.5 trillion yuan ($361 billion) into renewable power generation by 2020, the country’s energy agency said on Thursday, as the world’s largest energy market continues to shift away from dirty coal power towards cleaner fuels.\n\nThe investment will create over 13 million jobs in the sector, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said in a blueprint document that lays out its plan to develop the nation’s energy sector during the five-year 2016 to 2020 period.\n\nThe NEA said installed renewable power capacity including wind, hydro, solar and nuclear power will contribute to about half of new electricity generation by 2020.\n\nThe agency did not disclose more details on where the funds, which equate to about $72 billion each year, would be spent.\n\nStill, the investment reflects Beijing’s continued focus on curbing the use of fossil fuels, which have fostered the country’s economic growth over the past decade, as it ramps up its war on pollution.\n\nLast month, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country’s economic planner, said in its own five-year plan, that solar power will receive 1 trillion yuan of spending, as the country seeks to boost capacity by five times. That’s equivalent to about 1,000 major solar power plants, according to experts’ estimates.\n\nThe spending comes as the cost of building large-scale solar plants has dropped by as much as 40 percent since 2010. China became the world’s top solar generator last year.\n\n“The government may exceed these targets because there are more investment opportunities in the sector as costs go down,” said Steven Han, renewable analyst with securities firm Shenyin Wanguo.\n\nSome 700 billion yuan will go towards wind farms, 500 billion to hydro power with tidal and geothermal getting the rest, the NDRC said.\n\nThe NEA’s job creation forecast differs from the NDRC’s in December that said it expected an additional 3 million jobs, bringing the total in the sector to 13 million by 2020.\n\nConcerns about the social and economic costs of China’s air pollution have increased as the northern parts of the country, including the capital Beijing, have battled a weeks-long bout of hazardous smog.\n\nIllustrating the enormity of the challenge, the NEA repeated on Thursday that renewables will still only account for just 15 percent of overall energy consumption by 2020, equivalent to 580 million tonnes of coal.\n\nMore than half of the nation’s installed power capacity will still be fueled by coal over the same period.\n\nA security guard stands in front of windmills used to generate energy in Shanghai November 28, 2011.

According to the International Organization for Migration, 94,802 migrants have reached Italian shores so far this year, while 2,221 migrants have died attempting the treacherous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy\n\nThe Italian Parliament passed a bill on Wednesday that green-lighted Libya's original request for help, sent in a letter from the Prime Minister of Libya's UN-recognized Government of National Accord on July 27.\n\nAccording to an Italian Navy spokesperson, the two ships -- a patrol vessel and a technical and logistical support unit -- could be deployed to Libyan waters as early as next week.\n\nLibya is a popular jumping-off point for migrants hoping to reach European shores.

"Egyptian warplanes strike 'terrorist' targets after mosque attack kills 305\nScores more wounded when al-Rawdah mosque in north Sinai bombed and fleeing worshippers gunned down\n\nEgypt’s military has responded with airstrikes directed at “terrorist” locations and vehicles after hundreds of people were killed in a bomb and gun assault on a mosque in the north of the country.\n\nEgypt’s chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, said the 305 people killed included 27 children, while a further 128 people were wounded in the attack on the Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, north Sinai.\n\nIn the deadliest attack in the country in recent memory, a bomb ripped through the mosque as Friday prayers were finishing, before militants in four off-road vehicles approached.\n\nSadeq said the attack was carried out by 25 to 30 militants, who stationed themselves at the mosque’s main door and 12 windows before opening fire on worshippers inside.\n\nMore than 50 ambulances ferried casualties from the mosque, about 25 miles (40km) west of the city of Arish, to nearby hospitals. Pictures from the scene showed rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it marks a major escalation in a region where for the past three years Egyptian security forces have battled an Islamic State insurgency that has killed hundreds of police and soldiers.\n\nThe Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, delivered a defiant television address on Friday evening, vowing to respond with “brute force” and offering condolences to the families of victims.\n\n“This act will only increase our will and unity,” he said. “The police and military will avenge our martyrs and restore peace and security.”\n\nHe added: “We will respond with brute force to combat these terrorists and deviants ... This is an attempt to deter us from fighting terrorism and to destroy our will, but we are steadfast, and I say to all Egyptians, the battle you are fighting is the most honourable.”\n\nHours after the attack, Egypt’s military launched airstrikes on targets in mountainous areas around Bir al-Abed, security sources and witnesses said. The targets were described as vehicles used in the attack and “terrorist” locations where weapons and ammunition were stocked.\n\nSisi, a former armed forces commander who presents himself as a bulwark against Islamist militants in the region, convened an emergency security meeting with his defence and interior ministers and intelligence chief after the attack and declared three days of mourning.\n\nOne witness, a shop owner from Bir al-Abed, said local people heard a massive blast followed by gunfire. When he arrived at the site of the attack he saw people rushing to pick up the bodies and to offer help to the injured. He said he saw at least 20 bodies wrapped in cloths and blankets.\n\nOne resident whose relatives were at the scene told Reuters that the attackers shot at people as they left the mosque, and also at the ambulances. The attackers had also set alight nearby vehicles to try to block routes away from the mosque.\n\nThe mosque belongs to a Sufi order – a mystical branch of Islam whose followers are regarded by hardline Islamists as apostates because they revere saints and shrines.\n\nAn Isis propaganda outlet had previously published an interview with the commander of its “morality police” in Sinai who said their “first priority was to combat the manifestations of polytheism including Sufism”.\n\nThe attack came days before the annual celebrations of the prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Festivals are being held by Sufi-affiliated mosques around the country.\n\nAnother witness, a student who gave his name only as Mohamed, told the Guardian he had heard calls for help emanating from other nearby mosques after Friday’s attack.\n\n“I went with my family and friends to the scene of the mosque and found ambulances loading bodies and injured,” he said. “What happened in al-Rawdah is a massacre against peaceful civilians.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Egyptians walk past bodies following a gun and bombing attack at the Rawdah mosque. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe said residents went to every pharmacy and clinic they could to gather medicine and instruments for local hospitals treating the wounded.\n\n“In the Ber al-Abd hospitals, there was chaos,” he said. “Blood and screaming were everywhere. We heard that [all] male members of one family were killed, the elders, the youth and the children.”\n\nStriking at a mosque would be a change in tactics for the Sinai militants, who have usually targeted security forces since bloodshed in the Sinai worsened after Sisi led the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013.\n\nBut jihadis have also targeted Sinai tribes working with the armed forces, branding them traitors for their cooperation.\n\nIn July at least 23 soldiers were killed when suicide car bombs hit two military checkpoints in the Sinai, an attack for which Isis claimed responsibility.\n\nThe local Isis affiliate, Wilayat Sinai (the governorate of Sinai), also carried out the previous deadliest attack in the region when it downed a Russian passenger jet carrying tourists back from the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in 2015, killing 224 people.\n\nMilitants have tried to expand beyond the largely barren, desert Sinai peninsula into Egypt’s heavily populated mainland, attacking Coptic Christian churches and pilgrims.\n\nIn May gunmen attacked a Coptic group travelling to a monastery in southern Egypt, killing 29.\n\nThe grand imam of al-Azhar mosque in Cairo, the centre of Sunni learning, condemned the attack as an “attempt to spread chaos”.\n\n“After targeting Christians, the turn for mosques have come,” he said in a statement. “As if terrorism wants to unite Egyptians in deaths and chaos, nevertheless it will be defeated, and the will of Egyptians will prevail.”\n\n\n\nThere was also international condemnation for the attack. The UN security council and the secretary-general, António Guterres, issued a statement calling the assault a “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack” and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.\n\n“The world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence,” US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter, calling the assault “horrible and cowardly”.\n\n\n\nHe later tweeted:\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will. Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt.\n\nThe UK foreign minister, Boris Johnson, condemned the “barbaric” assault, while his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, expressed his condolences to the families of victims of the “despicable attack”.\n\nAhmed Aboul Gheit, head of the Arab League, which is based in Cairo, condemned the “terrifying crime which again shows that Islam is innocent of those who follow extremist terrorist ideology”, his spokesman said in a statement.\n\nAgence France-Press contributed to this report","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/24/egypt-mosque-attack-kills-dozens-reports","1511499600.0"
"Zimbabwe latest: Embattled Mugabe in first public appearance\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Mugabe wore blue and yellow robes and a mortarboard hat\n\nZimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has made his first public appearance since the army took over on Wednesday.\n\nHe attended a graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare, handing out degrees.\n\nMr Mugabe had been under house arrest for days. The army made its move after a power struggle over his successor.\n\nThe military said on Friday it was 'engaging' with Mr Mugabe and would advise the public on the outcome of talks 'as soon as possible'.\n\nMeanwhile Christopher Mutsvangwa - the leader of the influential war veterans' association, once loyal to Mr Mugabe - said he should step down at once.\n\nHe called for a huge turnout in street protests on Saturday.\n\n'We want to restore our pride and tomorrow is the day... we can finish the job which the army started,' Mr Mutsvangwa said.\n\n'There's no going back about Mugabe. He must leave.'\n\nLiberal groups opposed to the president have also backed the rally.\n\nThe leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Mr Mugabe is chancellor at the Open University\n\nMr Mugabe's attendance at the graduation is an annual tradition but he was not expected this year.\n\nBBC Online Africa editor Joseph Winter says he was allowed to be there partly to keep up the pretence that the military have not staged a coup and partly because of a genuine, deeply felt respect for him going back more than 40 years.\n\nMr Mugabe walked slowly up a red carpet and joined the crowd in singing the national anthem, then opened the graduation ceremony at Zimbabwe's Open University, where he is chancellor.\n\nOne of the people he conferred a degree upon was Marry Chiwenga, the wife of the general who detained him on Wednesday, the state broadcaster reports.\n\nNeither the 93-year-old president's wife, Grace Mugabe, nor Education Minister Jonathan Moyo - an ally of hers whose house was reportedly raided by the military - were present.\n\nThe army acted after Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week.\n\nMr Mnangagwa was seen as a potential successor and his sacking was supposed to have paved the way for Grace Mugabe - who is four decades younger than him - to take over the presidency instead.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who is Grace Mugabe?\n\nIt was thought she had left the country but it emerged on Thursday that she was at home with Mr Mugabe.\n\nUneasy calm in Mugabe's village\n\nBy Stanley Kwenda, BBC News, Kutama\n\nTo get to President Robert Mugabe's rural home you drive along the Robert Mugabe highway.\n\nIt's probably one of the best maintained roads in Zimbabwe, like driving on a carpet.

As we arrived there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe is respected here - to many he's a father and a friend. A 65-year-old neighbour of his told me: 'He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight.'\n\nThe man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits.\n\n'He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare,' said the man at his compound.\n\nHe said he supports the move by the army saying it's meant to correct a broken system.\n\n'If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong,' he said.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nMilitary vehicles were spotted on roads leading to the Zimbabwean capital Harare on Tuesday, sparking rumours that something was afoot.\n\nLater, soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC and loud explosions and gunfire were heard.\n\nMajor General Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe.\n\nThe military was only targeting what he called 'criminals' around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup.\n\nOn Thursday Mr Mugabe was pictured smiling as he took part in talks with an army general and South African government ministers at State House but sources suggested he might be resisting pressure to resign.\n\nWhat's the reaction in the country?\n\nZimbabweans have been posting on Facebook and Twitter that there has been no dramatic effect on normal life.\n\nPeople say that shops have opened as normal but there are few people on the streets of the capital.\n\nSome Zimbabweans spoken to by the BBC have welcomed the news, with one man expressing his thanks to the army for 'taking out the tyrant'.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control\n\nWhat has the reaction been across the World?","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42024920","None"
"His grandfather was a slave. Now he's a vocal champion for Confederate monuments.\n\n\nNelson Winbush holds the Confederate flag that draped his grandfather’s casket. Louis Napoleon Nelson was a soldier in the Confederate army. (Eve Edelheit for The Washington Post)\n\nAbout US is a new initiative by The Washington Post to cover issues of identity in the United States. Look for the About US newsletter launching this fall.\n\nST. CLOUD, Fla. — Nelson Winbush relishes talking about his grandfather’s time as a Confederate soldier, fighting at the command of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general, slave trader and imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe 88-year-old retired Florida educator proudly wears hats, shirts and a belt buckle emblazoned with Confederate flags. And he’s the star of a video featuring members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, in which he talks about the flag’s history, calling it a symbol of Christianity, not slavery.\n\nWinbush is also black, and so was his grandfather.\n\n“When I joined, it wasn’t any kind of rebellion,” Winbush said of his membership with the Sons of Confederate Veterans. He voted to install a Confederate monument in a veterans park near his home, where a tribute to Union soldiers already stood. “I wanted to set the record straight. A lot of people thought blacks fled, but blacks fought in every state.”\n\n[New Confederate monuments are still being built across the country — even in Union states]\n\nWinbush said he learned of his grandfather’s devotion to the Confederacy during horse and buggy rides that he took with the veteran when he was a child.\n\nAs his grandfather Louis Napoleon Nelson told it, he followed his master and sons into the war, first working as a cook but later serving as a rifleman and chaplain to both black and white soldiers.\n\nWinbush said his grandfather believed he was defending his home state of Tennessee from “Yankee” invaders, not fighting to preserve slavery. His final wish, Winbush said, was that he be buried in his Confederate uniform.\n\nThis pride has been embraced by Winbush, who joined the Sons of Confederate Veterans nearly three decades ago. In one of the videos he has appeared in for the group, he speaks of black soldiers serving alongside white soldiers as equals in the Confederate Army. At one point, he holds up an application his grandfather filed with the federal government in 1920 for a federal pension. The document shows the application was accepted.\n\n“Did black Confederates fight?” he says in the video. “I rest my case with this.”\n\n\n\nNelson Winbush holds his grandfather’s Confederate soldier uniform. His grandfather, Louis Napoleon Nelson, was a soldier in the Confederate army. (Eve Edelheit for The Washington Post)\n\nDavid Blight, a professor of American history at Yale University, said there were black Confederate soldiers, but most historians do not believe there is evidence that they served voluntarily and that they were treated as equals during the war. The Constitution of the Confederate States of America explicitly states that slavery was a central cause for the South’s decision to fight to secede.\n\nBlight said the version of events that recalls black soldiers as co-signers to the Confederate Army’s mission emerged after the war, growing out of the Lost Cause tradition.\n\n[‘What’s up with the Nazi flag?’: A lifelong Southerner goes to battle over neighbor’s display]\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Blight said, the Sons of Confederate Veterans began to promote this as historical fact, saying that many Southern blacks had supported the war.\n\n“It’s a popular mythology — the trusted, contented slave,” Blight said. “And if you want the Confederacy to be somehow palatable in the post-civil rights era, it helps if people believe there were a whole lot of black people who supported it.”\n\nMichael Landree, executive director of the national Sons of Confederate Veterans, said history supports Blight’s version only because “the victor always writes the history.” That’s why his group is opening a $5 million, 18,500-square-foot museum to the Confederacy next year in Tennessee.\n\n“It will include exhibits and stories from soldiers of all different faiths and backgrounds,” Landree said. “It will include black veterans, Native Americans, Jews and Catholics. The diversity of the Confederacy was tremendous.”\n\nThe Sons of Confederate Veterans has repeatedly turned to Winbush to help further, as Landree described it, the “Southern version of the war” and has enlisted him to help promote the group’s logo, which includes a Confederate battle flag.\n\n[Stone Mountain: The ugly past — and fraught future — of the biggest Confederate monument]\n\nWhen Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) began his successful effort in 2015 to ban and recall Sons of Confederate Veterans license plates with the Confederate flag logo in his state, the group flew Winbush in to speak at a state legislative hearing. NAACP officials argued that the flag was a racist symbol. Winbush argued the opposite.\n\n“This is probably the most misunderstood flag in the whole world,” he testified, saying the blue stripes and red field represent Christianity and purity. “People are ignorant of what it represents and why it was designed.”\n\nThe hearing showed what an enigma the former educator had become. Far from estranged from the NAACP and other black groups, Winbush served as grand marshal in a Rev.

"How hurricanes form\nHurricane Irma, a Category 5 blasting through the Caribbean this week, and Hurricane Harvey, a devastating storm that tore through southeast Texas less than two weeks ago, both began as a group of thunderstorms moving west off the west coast of Africa -- which is how some of the most destructive hurricanes that make landfall in the U.S. start.\n\nInterested in Hurricanes? Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHere is how those dangerous storms form:\n\nThat group of thunderstorms feeds off the warmth and moisture of the ocean. Air then rises to form more storms and is replaced constantly by the surrounding air. Below all this air rising, low pressure develops.\n\nRiding along the trade winds and rotating counterclockwise -- as a result of the earth's rotation -- the storm will keep growing as long as it has three key ingredients:\n\n1. Water temperatures at or above 79 degrees\n\n2. Open water, which hurricanes need to survive\n\n3. High pressure above the storm to keep it away from wind shear\n\nThe eye of the hurricane forms as air rotates up and out of the hurricane and some of the air that's being spun out of the top of the storm sinks back into the center. This keeps the eye of the storm relatively calm and clear.\n\nImmediately surrounding the tranquil eye is the most violent part of the hurricane: the eye wall. The most intense wind speeds at the surface are found there. The most destruction in a hurricane usually comes from the eye wall and the right (front) quadrant.\n\nThe combination of high wind speeds inside the storm, the storm's forward motion and the storm surge can lead to a disastrous hurricane.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/hurricanes-form-explained-abc-news-chief-meteorologist-ginger/story?id=49650211","None"
"Exclusive: Federal agents found fetuses in body broker's warehouse (Warning: Graphic images)\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal agents discovered four preserved fetuses in the Detroit warehouse of a man who sold human body parts, confidential photographs reviewed by Reuters show.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Arthur Rathburn is pictured at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S. in November 1988. REUTERS/Peter Yates/File Photo\n\nThe fetuses were found during a December 2013 raid of businessman Arthur Rathburn’s warehouse. The fetuses, which appear to have been in their second trimester, were submerged in a liquid that included human brain tissue.\n\nRathburn, a former body broker, is accused of defrauding customers by sending them diseased body parts. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is set for January.\n\nHow Rathburn acquired the fetuses and what he intended to do with them is unclear. Rathburn’s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment, and neither the indictment nor other documents made public in his case mention the fetuses.\n\n“This needs to be reviewed,” said U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee who recently chaired a special U.S. House committee on the use of fetal tissue.\n\nBlackburn recoiled when a Reuters reporter showed her some of the photographs, taken by government officials involved in the raid.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Reuters has pixelated this image; editors judged the original image to be disturbingly graphic. In a photograph obtained by Reuters, a fetus lies alongside a government evidence marker. The fetus and three others were found during a 2013 search of a Detroit warehouse operated by Arthur Rathburn, a businessman who sold human body parts for medical research and education. Rathburn has pleaded not guilty to selling infected body parts of adults. Government photo via REUTERS\n\nIn four of the photos, a crime scene investigator in a hazmat suit uses forceps to lift a different fetus from the brownish liquid. In three other photos, a marker that includes a government evidence identification number lies beside a fetus.\n\n“The actions depicted in these photos are an insult to human dignity,” said U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. A Republican from Virginia, Goodlatte said that if individuals “violate federal laws and traffic in body parts of unborn children for monetary gain,” they should be “held accountable.”\n\nBlackburn said the discoveries in Rathburn’s warehouse raise questions about the practices of body brokers across America. Such brokers take cadavers donated to science, dismember them and sell them for parts, typically for use in medical research and education. The multimillion-dollar industry has been built largely on the poor, who donate their bodies in return for a free cremation of leftover body parts.\n\nThe buying and selling of cadavers and other body parts — with the exception of organs used in transplants — is legal and virtually unregulated in America. But trading in fetal tissue violates U.S. law.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Reuters has pixelated this image; editors judged the original image to be disturbingly graphic.

Government photo via REUTERS\n\nIn most states, including Michigan, public health authorities are not required to regularly inspect body broker facilities. As a result, it’s impossible to know whether body brokers who deal in adult donors are acquiring and profiting from fetuses.\n\nBlackburn’s call for action came in response to a Reuters series that exposed abuses in the human body trade and what Blackburn called “lax oversight” and “lax enforcement” of the industry.\n\nPhotos from inside Rathburn’s warehouse offered a stark example of government failures to police the industry. They include images of rotting human heads, some floating face up in a plastic cooler. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has been investigating Rathburn and other body brokers, declined to comment.\n\nBlackburn said she found other Reuters stories about the body trade disturbing.\n\nAs part of the news agency’s examination of the industry, for example, a Reuters reporter was able to purchase two human heads and a cervical spine from Restore Life USA, a broker based in Blackburn’s home state of Tennessee.

"ANALYSIS: How the US helped to defuse Saudi Arabia's dangerous gambit with Lebanon\nThe recent bizarre episode of Lebanon's prime minister resigning while in Saudi Arabia and on Saudi TV sparked confusion around the world. But few may have realized how momentous and potentially dangerous the incident actually was.\n\nInterested in Saudi Arabia? Add Saudi Arabia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Saudi Arabia news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIt turned out to be an impulsive power play by one of the Trump administration's most important allies in the Middle East. And it might have brought the region dangerously close to war had it not been for deft intervention by the United States and France.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. seems to be in retreat from the world stage, with many vacant positions in American embassies in crucial countries - including Saudi Arabia - and big reductions in State Department staff, this episode brought into sharp focus the U.S.'s still-essential role as an international power broker. The diplomatic response to the incident also marked France's return to the international stage.\n\n'U.S. diplomats and decision-makers played the major role in pushing back against Saudi Arabia's impulsive move and identifying the pathway to defuse this crisis,' said Randa Slim, director of conflict resolution at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nIt all started when Saudi Crown Prince Mohamad Bin Salman decided to simply bench his Lebanese ally, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, whom the prince saw as too mellow in the face of Iranian influence in the region, and replace him with his older brother, Bahaa, according to multiple sources.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s recent praise of Hariri for his efforts in the fight against ISIS plus fears that his resignation could spark a devastating war between Lebanon, specifically Hezbollah, and Israel – two matters of fundamental importance to the U.S. in the region – didn’t seem to shield Hariri from the crown prince’s new plans in the region.\n\nPrince Mohamad was intent on rolling back Iranian interference in a more robust and direct way, and Lebanon was his arena du jour.\n\nThus began the high-stakes drama that played out over two weeks and which revealed both the governing style of the man expected to rule Saudi Arabia for the coming decades and the pitfalls of leaving the two competing regional powers in the Middle East -- Iran and Saudi Arabia -- unchecked.\n\nThe events that followed required many delicate and private diplomatic conversations, involving the United States, France, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and some elaborate stage managing.\n\nThe Saudi plan\n\nHariri was in Saudi Arabia two days before his resignation, a visit that left him upbeat and confident and apparently with no indication that the Saudis intended to dramatically pull their support for him.\n\nHe left expecting to return within days for more meetings with the Saudi leadership, but certainly not to be instructed to resign or to be barred from leaving Saudi Arabia, according to Lebanese sources close to him. What caused the shift in tone in those 48 hours has not yet been fully established.\n\nNevertheless, it appears the Saudi plan, in the works for some time, was to replace Hariri with his brother, Bahaa, per multiple sources. The two have been at odds since their father, the late Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in 2005.\n\n'Bahaa Hariri was extremely interested and angling for the position. In private discussions in Washington, D.C., he was voicing his displeasure with his brother’s policies and advocating a more hawkish position against Hezbollah and Iran,' according to Firas Maksad, deputy executive director of the Arabia Foundation, a think tank in Washington.\n\nWael Hamzeh/EPA\n\nBahaa didn’t get the reception he was hoping for. 'People weren't too excited about him taking on Saad's position,' according to a U.S. diplomatic source.\n\nABC News has asked the Saudi embassy in Washington for comment on the Hariri crisis but the request is still under review.\n\nHariri, who has since returned to Lebanon and put his resignation on hold says he wasn’t forced to resign and was not held captive in Saudi Arabia.\n\n'I wanted to cause a positive shock,' he repeated, to warn Hezbollah, his partner in Lebanon's government, of the dangers posed by its central role within the anti-Saudi Iranian axis in places like Syria, Yemen and Bahrain.\n\nCountering Iran is everything\n\nThe Saudi crown prince's gambit showed his determination to counter Iran, said Slim of the Middle East Institute.\n\n'One principal plank in [his] foreign policy is that Saudi Arabia will deploy all resources necessary to contest Iranian influence in the region,' Slim said.\n\nAs the Saudi military has been fighting a two-year war in Yemen against Iranian-backed rebels whom it contends are aided militarily by Hezbollah, Hariri has led a government in which Hezbollah held veto power.\n\nThis was a situation the Saudi leadership was no longer willing to accept.\n\n'The Hariri family, and its political party, has long been the main recipient of Saudi patronage, beholden both financially and politically, in Lebanon,' according to Faysal Itani, resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, another Washington think tank.\n\nSo Saudi Arabia decided to call in its chips, inviting the Hariri family to visit to rubber-stamp a leadership change in Lebanon.\n\nBut the Hariris in an unprecedented show of defiance refused and called on foreign allies, namely France, for help, per sources close to the family.\n\nHence began 10 days of diplomatic negotiations, led by France with crucial American assistance that played out from Riyadh to Beirut and Tehran.\n\nFrance steps up\n\nThis was the perfect moment for France’s ambitious new president, Emmanuel Macron, to try to reclaim the once-pivotal role his country had in the region before being sidelined by America.\n\nFrance has a deep historical relationship with Lebanon and, unlike America, has also preserved diplomatic relations with Iran and Hezbollah’s political wing, in addition to having a relationship with Saudi Arabia. It used all three assets in managing this crisis.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron made a last-minute stop in Riyadh on Nov. 9 on his way back from his state visit to the United Arab Emirates, upon the recommendation of the Emirati crown prince, a close Saudi ally.\n\nAvant de rentrer à Paris, passage en Arabie Saoudite pour échanger avec le prince héritier Mohammed ben Salmane. pic.twitter.com/3boNjNQemD — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) November 9, 2017\n\nIn a meeting with Prince Mohamad, the French president mentioned the case of Hariri and Lebanon, a French diplomatic source who wouldn’t comment on the Saudi crown prince's reaction told ABC News. 'They also discussed the regional situation including Iran’s policies as well as the missile launched from Yemen on Riyadh.'\n\nAt the time of the meeting, Macron was the first high-level foreign official to link Iran to the Yemeni missile launch, a position later taken also by the U.S. military and United Nations monitors, as reported by Reuters on Nov. 30.\n\nMacron's early backing of Saudi’s complaints against Iran helped to open communications. But it wasn't enough to resolve the Hariri situation that day.\n\nA video posted to the French president’s Twitter account showed him thanking the Saudi crown prince for making the time to see him, a respectful deference that is appreciated in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAround the same time, the United States, seemingly absent from the management of this crisis, worked behind the scenes to deal a crucial blow against the Saudi plan.\n\nUS deals death blow to Saudi plan\n\nOn Nov. 10, Thamer al Sabhan, the Saudi minister for Gulf affairs, who also oversaw policy toward Lebanon, met with David Satterfield, the top U.S. official on the Middle East at the State Department. It was a rocky meeting, in which Satterfield made it clear that the U.S. did not support the Saudi handling of Hariri.\n\nWhile the U.S. administration agrees with the Saudi leadership on the need to more robustly confront Iran and Hezbollah, it advocates a more calibrated approach in Lebanon, mindful that a disintegration of the state there would complicate American efforts to both resolve the Syrian crisis and continue stabilizing Iraq.\n\nSabhan received the same message from the U.S. National Security Council, according to two Lebanese sources and one American official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to comment publicly. Both the State Department and the NSC had no comment when contacted by ABC News.\n\nSzwarc Henri/ABACA via Newscom\n\nThe Saudi minister was asked to take a step back shortly after meeting with the U.S. official, but it was just a tactical adjustment, according to Maksad of the Arabia Foundation. 'The Saudi position remains that it is unacceptable for its ally in Lebanon, namely Hariri, to provide political cover for Hezbollah.'\n\nNov. 10 also marked the first time that a foreign official indicated Hariri may not be fully free in Saudi Arabia, with a French foreign ministry spokeswoman saying, 'We wish for Mr. Hariri to have his full freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon.'\n\nThis came after Hariri met with the U.S. charge d’affaires and the French ambassador in Riyadh. Lebanese sources close to Hariri maintain he was monitored in these meetings by a Saudi note-taker, a highly unusual presence in diplomatic conversations in which Saudi Arabia is not involved. The French foreign ministry would not comment on that.\n\nLater that afternoon, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reaffirmed support for Hariri as prime minister of Lebanon, and in an apparent reference to both Saudi and Iranian interference in Lebanon, cautioned against, 'using Lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts.' He also encouraged Hariri to return to Lebanon and officially step down, discrediting assassination-plot fears that Hariri had mentioned in his resignation speech.\n\nThe next day, the White House joined the chorus of support for Hariri when it put out a statement referring to him as a 'trusted partner.'\n\n'The U.S. policy remains to push back against Iran and its proxies,' says Itani of the Atlantic Council, 'but since doing it in Iraq and Syria, where it matters most, comes at the highest cost, it is doing it by supporting the Saudi war effort in Yemen, by imposing calibrated financial sanctions against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and by supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces.”\n\nWith such open U.S. support for Hariri, the Saudi leadership realized its initial plan wouldn’t succeed.\n\nFrance and art of compromise\n\nFrance leveraged its lines of communication with Hezbollah and Iran as well as its relationship with Saudi Arabia to work on achieving a satisfactory compromise while also managing the optics of the delicate operation.\n\nOn Nov. 12, Hariri gave his first interview since his resignation. It was conducted by the star anchor of his own television network at the home he owns in Riyadh. This was the first step toward ending the crisis, per a French diplomatic source. But there were still thorny negotiations ahead that required careful stage managing.\n\nThat same day, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, and his chief of staff, the former French ambassador to Lebanon, Emmanuel Bonne, who was involved in managing the crisis, planted a Lebanese cedar tree in the garden of the French foreign ministry in Paris.\n\nLe Ministre plante un Cèdre du Liban dans les jardins de l’Hôtel du Ministre au Quai d’Orsay - Amitié ???????? @francediplo @AmbaFranceLiban pic.twitter.com/V1CR5B3TSb — Arnaud Pescheux (@pescheuxa) November 12, 2017\n\n'Of course this was highly symbolic. Choosing to plant a Lebanese cedar, at that moment, was meant to signal France's deep-rooted relationship with and attachment to Lebanon's stability and integrity,' per the French diplomatic source.\n\nLe Drian was expected in Riyadh three days later to discuss bilateral interests as well as find a solution to the Hariri crisis. This involved ongoing negotiations over his return to Lebanon and the elaboration of the plan to put his resignation on hold. Just as he was arriving, Macron offered Saudi Arabia a face saving end to the Hariri fiasco. He explained in a statement that he was inviting Hariri and his family to spend a few days in Paris, after having discussed the matter with the Saudi crown prince.\n\nBy the time Le Drian left Riyadh the evening of Nov. 16, French diplomats felt confident they had worked out a deal with Saudi leadership and Hariri would head to Paris two days later.\n\nThe need for France to stage-manage the Hariri-Saudi relationship didn't stop then, though. Hariri's family, who is based in Saudi Arabia, was publicly hosted twice at the Elysee, in an effort partly aimed at dispelling concerns for their well-being in the Kingdom. Yet, speculation has persisted in Lebanon that Hariri's wife and school-aged children will remain in Paris, instead of returning to Saudi Arabia where they have spent all their lives, as result of what is perceived as a souring of the relationship.\n\nNegotiating a regional compromise\n\nMany in Lebanon have noted the irony of Hariri’s need for French assistance to return to Lebanon on the eve of the country's 74th anniversary of independence from France. Yet securing his return was not the thorniest part. Reaching a regional agreement that would shield Lebanon from the larger conflict is an uphill battle.\n\nThere were some initially encouraging signs though. On Nov. 20, two days before Hariri's return to Lebanon, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah gave the most noteworthy rhetorical concession to date, announcing in a speech, 'I categorically deny any role of any member of Hezbollah in launching this missile.' Nasrallah also toned down his inflammatory rhetoric toward Saudi Arabia. This helped allow Hariri to put his resignation on hold.\n\nTrès sensible et reconnaissant au Président @EmmanuelMacron et son épouse Brigitte d’avoir invité ma femme Lara et nos enfants Louloua et Abdelaziz à l’Élysée aujourd’hui. Merci pour ce geste d’amitié familiale. pic.twitter.com/f0IBXNpVoV — Saad Hariri (@saadhariri) November 25, 2017\n\nNevertheless, that was followed by consecutive defiant and inflammatory statements by Iranian and Saudi officials, continuing to stoke tensions between the rival regional powers. Meanwhile, Hariri's ongoing rapprochement with pro-Iranian parties in Lebanon, marking the failure of the Saudi gambit, has renewed Lebanese fears of punishing Saudi-led financial measures against the country. France is expected to host a meeting of the Group of International Support for Lebanon this week, as part of its continued efforts to bring about a compromise and stabilise the situation.\n\n'Their plan to replace Saad Hariri with someone who espouses a tougher and more confrontational line against Hezbollah has backfired,' said Slim. “If the objective was to push the Lebanese to rally against Hezbollah, this move did exactly the opposite: It diverted attention away from Hezbollah and focused it instead on the humiliating and arrogant Saudi treatment of Hariri.'\n\nThough Hariri has called the role Macron played in the crisis 'historic,' the crisis is not over yet. The deal still being worked out for Lebanon depends on precarious agreements, vulnerable to Saudi-Iranian tensions that, despite the efforts of French mediation, continue unabated.\n\nABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/analysis-us-showed-crucial-international-role-defusing-saudi/story?id=51549715","None"
"A cop stopped a car for speeding — then pointed a gun at a passenger for more than 9 minutes\nThis video, edited for brevity by The Post, shows the July 26 traffic stop where a Campbell, Calif. police officer pointed his gun at a man for more than nine minutes. (ViralHog)\n\nA video taken during a traffic stop in California is drawing debate over the officer’s decision to keep his gun pointed at the passenger for more than nine minutes.\n\nThe stop took place last Wednesday morning along U.S. Route 101, south of San Jose, after an officer noticed a car pass him going 85 mph, according to the Campbell Police Department.\n\nAfter stopping the car for speeding, the officer requested the driver’s license and additional paperwork. The driver and passenger spent several minutes looking for the paperwork before the officer walked back to his motorcycle to write a citation, police said.\n\nIt was at that point their stories diverged. According to police, the passenger began reaching “under his seat.”\n\n“It is not clear why the passenger chose to reach under the seat since the officer was not requesting any other paperwork,” Campbell police said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the passenger’s unexpected movement towards the bottom of the seat, caused the officer to perceive a threat and draw his handgun.”\n\nHowever, a man sitting in the vehicle’s passenger seat — the target of the officer’s gun — maintained throughout the incident that he had simply been reaching for some papers on the floor to try to find the vehicle’s license and registration, as requested.\n\nA video that apparently was recorded by a woman in the car begins as the male passenger is expressing incredulity that the officer has pulled a gun.\n\n“Wow,” the passenger says in the video, laughing. “We’re looking for the f—ing paperwork, bro. Oh my God.”\n\n“I understand that,” the officer replies. “Don’t move, all right?”\n\n[Father ‘utterly terrified’ after trooper points gun at his 7-year-old during traffic stop]\n\nThe passenger sounds indignant as his hands remain on his lap. “Why are you still pointing that gun at me, bro?” he asks the officer. “Why are you still pointing the gun at me, though? Record this sh-t. Why are you still pointing the gun at me, bro? My hands are right here.”\n\n“I understand,” the officer says.\n\n“No, you don’t understand,” the passenger protests, as the officer tells him to relax. “No, I’m not going to relax. Get the f—king gun off me.”\n\nA woman in the car asks the officer: “Is that really necessary? His hands are both out.”\n\nThe officer says that it is necessary as he waits for backup to arrive, eliciting another round of protests from the vehicle’s passengers. For several more minutes, they remain at an impasse, with the passenger muttering periodic complaints as music plays in the background. The entire time, the officer’s gun is trained on the man.\n\nToward the end, the officer relays something through the radio and the passenger begins protesting again. At one point in the video, the officer mentions that there had been a screwdriver on the floor of the car.\n\n“Why are you trying to make this bigger than it is, bro?” the passenger says. “We complied with everything you asked for.”\n\n[A threatened officer had an instant to shoot — or not. Police want you to watch him decide.]\n\nThe video lasts a little more than nine minutes total, and the officer’s gun is pointed at the male passenger the entire time. Police said in a statement the officer had to wait longer than usual for backup to arrive “and provide assistance in safely resolving the situation.”\n\n“We understand that it is never a comfortable position to have a gun pointed at you, regardless of whether it is a police officer,” police said. “Unfortunately, the length of time that the officer’s gun was drawn lasted much longer than normal based on his location.”\n\nPolice said the traffic stop was resolved amicably.\n\n“In the end, the officer had a conversation with the passenger of the vehicle explaining his actions and why the gun was pointed at him,” police said. “The passenger indicated he understood why it happened and actually apologized to the officer. Both the driver and the passenger were issued citations and were allowed to leave.”\n\nHowever, the video was uploaded to Facebook last Saturday with a caption that suggested there may not have been as much understanding as police thought. (Note: The video contains profanity.)\n\n“CAMPBELL COP IS A B—-!!!!!!!!!!” wrote a Facebook user named “Feo Mas” who identified himself as the passenger in the video. “(He) pulled out a gun cuz I reached for paperwork he asked for.”\n\nA week later, the video had amassed nearly 2 million views on Facebook, as well as tens of thousands more on YouTube. Online, a debate raged: Several people defended the police officer and said they felt the passenger should have remained quiet, while others were outraged at how long the officer had trained his gun on the passenger despite the man’s hands being visible at all times.\n\nPolice departments are under increased scrutiny for violent, often fatal interactions with suspects. So far this year, 594 people have been shot and killed by police, according to The Washington Post’s Fatal Force database. Last year, police shot and killed 963 people.\n\n[FIRED/REHIRED: Police chiefs are often forced to put officers fired for misconduct back on the streets]\n\nIn a message Sunday night, the Facebook user who posted the video continued to dispute several aspects of the police account.\n\nThe Campbell Police Department said in a statement it was aware of the video circulating online, as well as the thousands of comments surrounding it. Police also cited an officer-involved shooting that had taken place in nearby Los Banos, Calif., as an example of the “unfortunate reality” that people sometimes attack police.\n\n“As an agency, we can understand the response to the Facebook video, and that is why we have and will continue engaging our community,” police said. “The comments on the Facebook video bring up a lot of different viewpoints about how the officer could have responded differently or used different tactics. Our officers receive a tremendous amount of training on a consistent basis and that training is what dictates our response. This is intended to protect our officers as well as those they come in contact with.”\n\nPolice said they had reviewed footage from the officer’s body cam, which included the beginning and end of the incident not shown in the Facebook video. The department did not release any footage from the officer’s camera. A Campbell police spokesman said Monday the department was still reviewing legal considerations around releasing the body-cam footage.\n\n“We are thankful that this incident resolved itself with no one getting injured and hope that this additional information provides clarification,” police said.\n\nCleve R.

"Man accused of killing rookie police officer in small-town Pennsylvania has been captured\nThe man who authorities say shot and killed a Pennsylvania police officer was caught Tuesday morning following a manhunt that lasted nearly 3 1/2 days.\n\nPennsylvania State Police announced early Tuesday that authorities had apprehended Rahmael Sal Holt, who is accused of fatally shooting New Kensington Police Officer Brian Shaw following a Friday night traffic stop about 20 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.\n\nWestmoreland County District Attorney John Peck said at a news conference Tuesday that Holt, 29, was arrested at a home in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Tribune Review reported that several associates and relatives, including the suspect’s mother, Sherry Holt, and another woman, Aysa Benson, were also arrested and accused of helping Rahmael Holt. Court records show the two have been charged with hindering apprehension, a third-degree felony.\n\nRahmael Holt has been charged with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer; murder of the first degree; possession of a firearm; and carrying a firearm without a license, according to an online court docket.\n\nThe shooting happened just after 8 p.m. Friday, when Shaw tried to pull over an SUV.\n\nHolt, who was the passenger, jumped out of the moving vehicle and Shaw ran after him, according to an affidavit. Surveillance footage shows Holt running to a nearby parking lot, where authorities said he shot Shaw.\n\n[Suspected cop killer arrested following days-long manhunt, Pennsylvania State Police say]\n\nPeck said Holt fired six shots, striking Shaw multiple times. The officer, who was wearing a vest, was able to radio to the 911 center that he had been shot. He tried to stand up before he fell down and was not able to return fire, Peck told reporters.\n\nThe surveillance footage shows Holt running toward the back of a building and into an alley after he shot Shaw, the affidavit said.\n\nThe 25-year-old officer, who had been with the New Kensington Police Department for less than a year, died at a hospital less than an hour later. The affidavit said he had multiple gunshot wounds to the torso.\n\nPolice later found the SUV not far from where the shooting occurred. The suspected driver, 27-year-old Tavon Jamere Harper, was arrested over the weekend and is facing fleeing and drug-related charges, court records show. Harper told investigators that he was accompanying Holt when Shaw tried to pull them over. After Holt leaped out, Harper said he kept driving, “clipping” Holt as he fled, the affidavit said.\n\nPeck said investigators received information from “various informants” that led to Holt’s capture. He did not elaborate further.\n\nHe said the investigation is still ongoing. The suspect’s weapon has not been found, but Peck said .40-caliber casings were found at the crime scene. Investigators also are still looking for people who had contact with Holt before and after the shooting.\n\nIt also remains unclear why Shaw tried to pull over the SUV.\n\nVideos and photos taken by local media Tuesday show Holt wearing a black hooded jacket as he was being led by officers to a small courthouse, where he was arraigned. Jail records show Holt is being held without bail. The Pittsburgh Tribune Review reported that he would hire a private attorney.\n\nWestmoreland Detective Ray Dupilka and New Ken police Chief Jim Klein spoke briefly before they led suspect Rahmael Holt to his arraignment on homicide charges. pic.twitter.com/6UVwSDdKAU — Renatta Signorini (@ByRenatta) November 21, 2017\n\nMultiple law enforcement agencies and several residents had offered a total of $55,000 to anyone who could provide information leading to Holt’s capture. Authorities have not said if that money has been awarded to anyone.\n\nSpeaking briefly at the news conference Tuesday, New Kensington Police Chief James Klein said Holt’s capture would allow him and his police officers to finally start grieving.\n\n“Our officers are dedicated to providing the best possible service to protect you and keep you safe. There’s no better example than Officer Brian Shaw who gave his life serving this community,” Klein said, taking deep breaths and pausing several times mid-sentence. “I promise you that officers will continue to serve with the same honor that Brian did.”\n\nKlein, as he did in previous news conferences, spoke only for a few minutes and did not take any questions from reporters.\n\n“At this time, it is important for me to spend time with the Shaw family,” he said.\n\nHe also asked reporters to refrain from contacting the officer’s family, thanked them and left the news conference before it was over.\n\n[Slain border agent may have been beaten to death by rocks in ‘grisly scene,’ union leader says]\n\nHolt has a lengthy criminal history that stretches back to at least 2007.

Robert E. Lee from a city park. On Saturday morning, protesters and counterprotesters faced off, kicking, punching, hurling water bottles at and deploying chemical sprays against one another.\n\nApproximately 500 protesters were on-site, with more than double the amount of counterprotesters, according to reporter Sandy Hausman of member station WVTF and Radio IQ. She said some injuries had been reported.\n\nPolice used tear gas to disperse the crowd, before offering protesters the option of being arrested or moving to another, larger location approximately 1 mile away, she told NPR's Scott Simon on Weekend Edition Saturday.\n\nThe declaration by Gov. McAuliffe was made in order to 'aid state response to violence' at the rally in the city about 120 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., and home to the University of Virginia. The city's manager also declared a local emergency and police ordered people to disperse from the area around the statue, according to the AP.\n\nThe 'Unite the Right' rally was expected to draw a lot of people from out of town. It follows last month's Ku Klux Klan rally, also in Charlottesville, that drew about 50 Klan members and about 1,000 counterprotesters.\n\nPoliticians react to Saturday morning's clashes\n\nAfter the violent outbursts, politicians tweeted their disdain at the events in Charlottesville. Trump called on Americans to 'come together as one.'\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said the views of the white nationalists were 'repugnant' and called for Americans to unite against 'this kind of vile bigotry.'\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump called for people to 'communicate [without] hate in our hearts.'\n\nNHL team logo used during white nationalist protest\n\nIn an odd side story, many of the white nationalist marchers were seen holding signs featuring the logo of the Detroit Red Wings, a historic hockey franchise in the NHL.\n\nAn anti-immigrant group called the Detroit Right Wings features a similar logo. A Twitter account that seemed to represent the group tweeted earlier in the week about attending Saturday's rally.\n\nAs images of marchers flaunting the logo began flooding social media, the team issued a swift statement in response.\n\n'The Detroit Red Wings vehemently disagree with and are not associated in any way with the event taking place today in Charlottesville,' the team said. 'We are exploring every possible legal action as it pertains to the misuse of our logo in this disturbing demonstration.'\n\nNHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly added in an email to the AP, 'This specific use is particularly offensive because it runs counter to the inclusiveness that our league values and champions.'\n\nFriday night protests turn violent\n\nThe clashes began Friday night, when far-right protesters carrying torches descended on the University of Virginia campus.\n\nIn a Facebook post about that march, Mayor Signer wrote, 'I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus.'\n\nIn the days leading up to Saturday's planned rally, there had been some back-and-forth about where it would be held.\n\nThe AP reported that a federal judge ordered Charlottesville to allow the rally to take place at its originally planned location downtown:\n\n'U.S. District Judge Glen Conrad issued a preliminary injunction Friday in a lawsuit filed against Charlottesville by right-wing blogger Jason Kessler. 'The city announced earlier this week that the rally must be moved out of Emancipation Park to a larger one, citing safety reasons. 'Kessler sued, saying the change was a free speech violation. The judge wrote that Kessler was likely to prevail and granted the injunction.'\n\nAfter the ruling, The New York Times reported:\n\n'Late Friday night, several hundred torch-bearing men and women marched on the main quadrangle of the University of Virginia's grounds, shouting, 'You will not replace us,' and 'Jew will not replace us.' They walked around the Rotunda, the university's signature building, and to a statue of Thomas Jefferson, where a group of counterprotesters were gathered, and a brawl ensued.'\n\nUniversity President Teresa Sullivan issued a statement after Friday night's march.\n\n'As President of the University of Virginia, I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior displayed by torch-bearing protestors that marched on our Grounds this evening. I strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order. 'Law enforcement continues to investigate the incident, and it is my hope that any individuals responsible for criminal acts are held accountable. The violence displayed on Grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the University's values.'\n\nCity officials and police say they are prepared for any violence. Gov. McAuliffe urged Virginians to stay away from the rally and placed the National Guard on standby. The guard released a statement saying it would 'closely monitor the situation.'\n\nEarlier this week, All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro reported on Airbnb's decision to make it harder for people attending the rally to find places to stay. The company canceled the accounts of people it confirmed had used its platform to book lodging for the event. It says those people defy its community standards. Rally organizers say this should be grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nDebate over the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville began when an African-American high school student started a petition more than a year ago to have it removed. Lee, who was born in Virginia, commanded Confederate forces in the Civil War from 1862 until he surrendered in 1865.\n\nNPR's Patricia Cole and Maquita Peters contributed to this report.\n\nThis is a developing story. Some things that get reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/12/542982015/home-to-university-of-virginia-prepares-for-violence-at-white-nationalist-rally","1502510400.0"
"Deadly Bombing in Kabul Is One of the Afghan War’s Worst Strikes\nAlthough the main Taliban spokesman claimed the group had nothing to do with the Kabul bomb, the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, blamed the Haqqani wing of the organization. Over the years, the Haqqanis have made an industry of large-scale attacks on the capital, and the militant cell has become integrated in the central leadership of the Taliban.\n\nThe deputy interior minister, Gen. Murad Ali Murad, said that besides the more than 80 people killed, with the death toll sure to rise, at least 463 had been wounded. Still, the general said the attacker had actually failed to get all the way to his most likely target: Security cameras showed the truck stopped by police officers who guarded the entrance to the street housing the German and Indian Embassies, as well as compounds for the coalition forces.\n\nBut for an explosion that shattered windows within a mile, a few steps off target made little difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith most of the city fasting to observe the holy month of Ramadan, residents urgently took up what has become a routine: sweeping broken glass, calling loved ones and calling others in search of news.\n\nIn different corners of the city, workers and relatives dug graves for the ones who, with life having become a game of chance, just were not lucky. Parents arrived to escort panicking children home from school, holding their hands and cautiously walking close to walls — as if walls could protect against such violence.\n\nFor more than two hours, smoke rose from the blast site, a 13-foot crater centered on a vast circle of destruction. The German Embassy, where officials said employees had retreated deeper into the compound after an earlier warning of a threat against them, was extensively damaged, with dozens of windows blown in.\n\n“There was a big tremble, and then we heard a massive explosion,” Ramin Sangar, a cameraman at a television channel near the bombing site, said as he was loaded into an ambulance. “All the windows are broken. Our studios collapsed.”\n\nAs security forces established a wide cordon and ambulances whizzed between hospitals and the street, dozens of people gathered on each side of the cordon, inching closer in hopes of hearing any good news at all about their missing.\n\nThere was a heavy security presence, including forces from the United States-led coalition, and helicopters circled overhead. Emotions were running high, as the Afghan security forces and emergency medical workers, too, were working while fasting.\n\nIntelligence officers closely checked the paperwork of emergency workers, fearing that they might have been infiltrated by militants planning a follow-up attack. At one point, after a senior police official tried to pass the cordon with a large entourage of guards, a scuffle broke out, and the police and intelligence officers faced off with their weapons ready. But the situation was quickly defused.\n\nFor the residents, much of the search for their loved ones then shifted to the hospitals, and crowds began to grow around the city’s treatment centers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 300 people anxiously waited outside the Emergency Hospital, one of the main trauma centers in the city. Some were weeping and wailing, while others were trying to look up names of loved ones on the lists that employees handed out. Inside the hospital, where the windows had also been shattered by the force of the blast, doctors were attending to dozens of wounded.\n\nOutside Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, the main government hospital, a white-bearded man in his 60s named Azizullah searched for news of his 22-year-old son, Abdullah, who worked at a telecommunications company near the site of the blast.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

What will I tell them?”\n\nMr. Azizullah received a call from someone who appeared to be inside the hospital, telling him about unrecognizable bodies.\n\n“Can you search the person whose body is cut up?” he asked the caller. “He may be my son. Try to find his documents.”\n\nBy the morgue in the hospital, a group of men tried to figure out whether the badly burned body in the back of an ambulance was their friend Ahmad Reshad, an employee of a telecom company in his 30s. One of the men was on the phone with Mr. Reshad’s wife, as others searched the body to try to make out details that could identify him: How much money was carrying? What color tie did he have on? The body had pills in one of his pockets — was Mr. Reshad carrying pills?\n\nThey could not identify the body, so it was shipped off for a forensic examination. The men continued their search at another hospital.\n\nIn a televised address as the city was preparing to go to sleep, President Ghani came out with a resolute message, calling for unity in the face of attackers who he said were receiving help from outside intelligence forces — frequent shorthand here for Pakistan’s military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, which has long maintained ties with the Haqqani network.\n\nThe year’s traumatic news began piling up even before the spring fighting season took off: massacres at a fortified army hospital and then an even more heavily fortified army base, another district fallen to the Taliban as stretched security forces collapsed, a city overrun two times on verge of falling again, more civilians killed.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/world/asia/kabul-explosion-afghanistan.html","1496203200.0"
"The World Once Laughed at North Korean Cyberpower. No More.\nAnd just as Western analysts once scoffed at the potential of the North’s nuclear program, so did experts dismiss its cyberpotential — only to now acknowledge that hacking is an almost perfect weapon for a Pyongyang that is isolated and has little to lose.\n\nThe country’s primitive infrastructure is far less vulnerable to cyberretaliation, and North Korean hackers operate outside the country, anyway. Sanctions offer no useful response, since a raft of sanctions are already imposed. And Mr. Kim’s advisers are betting that no one will respond to a cyberattack with a military attack, for fear of a catastrophic escalation between North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\n“Cyber is a tailor-made instrument of power for them,” said Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, who now teaches about security at the United States Naval Academy. “There’s a low cost of entry, it’s largely asymmetrical, there’s some degree of anonymity and stealth in its use. It can hold large swaths of nation state infrastructure and private-sector infrastructure at risk. It’s a source of income.”\n\nMr. Inglis, speaking at the Cambridge Cyber Summit this month, added: “You could argue that they have one of the most successful cyberprograms on the planet, not because it’s technically sophisticated, but because it has achieved all of their aims at very low cost.”\n\nIt is hardly a one-way conflict: By some measures the United States and North Korea have been engaged in an active cyberconflict for years.\n\nBoth the United States and South Korea have also placed digital “implants” in the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the North Korean equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents that Edward J. Snowden released several years ago. American-created cyber- and electronic warfare weapons were deployed to disable North Korean missiles, an attack that was, at best, only partially successful.\n\nIndeed, both sides see cyber as the way to gain tactical advantage in their nuclear and missile standoff.\n\nVideo\n\nA South Korean lawmaker last week revealed that the North had successfully broken into the South’s military networks to steal war plans, including for the “decapitation” of the North Korean leadership in the opening hours of a new Korean war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is evidence Pyongyang has planted so-called digital sleeper cells in the South’s critical infrastructure, and its Defense Ministry, that could be activated to paralyze power supplies and military command and control networks.\n\nBut the North is not motivated solely by politics: Its most famous cyberattack came in 2014, against Sony Pictures Entertainment, in a largely successful effort to block the release of a movie that satirized Mr. Kim.\n\nWhat has not been disclosed, until now, is that North Korea had also hacked into a British television network a few weeks earlier to stop it from broadcasting a drama about a nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.\n\nOnce North Korea counterfeited crude $100 bills to try to generate hard cash. Now intelligence officials estimate that North Korea reaps hundreds of millions of dollars a year from ransomware, digital bank heists, online video game cracking, and more recently, hacks of South Korean Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nOne former British intelligence chief estimates the take from its cyberheists may bring the North as much as $1 billion a year, or a third of the value of the nation’s exports.\n\nThe North Korean cyberthreat “crept up on us,” said Robert Hannigan, the former director of Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, which handles electronic surveillance and cybersecurity.\n\n“Because they are such a mix of the weird and absurd and medieval and highly sophisticated, people didn’t take it seriously,” he said. “How can such an isolated, backward country have this capability? Well, how can such an isolated backward country have this nuclear ability?”\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom Minor Leaguers to Serious Hackers\n\nKim Jong-il, the father of the current dictator and the initiator of North Korea’s cyberoperations, was a movie lover who became an internet enthusiast, a luxury reserved for the country’s elite. When Mr. Kim died in 2011, the country was estimated to have 1,024 IP addresses, fewer than on most New York City blocks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kim, like the Chinese, initially saw the internet as a threat to his regime’s ironclad control over information. But his attitude began to change in the early 1990s, after a group of North Korean computer scientists returned from travel abroad proposing to use the web to spy on and attack enemies like the United States and South Korea, according to defectors.\n\nNorth Korea began identifying promising students at an early age for special training, sending many to China’s top computer science programs. In the late 1990s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s counterintelligence division noticed that North Koreans assigned to work at the United Nations were also quietly enrolling in university computer programming courses in New York.\n\n“The F.B.I. called me and said, ‘What should we do?’ ” recalled James A. Lewis, at the time in charge of cybersecurity at the Commerce Department. “I told them, ‘Don’t do anything. Follow them and see what they are up to.’”\n\nThe North’s cyberwarfare unit gained priority after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. After watching the American “shock and awe” campaign on CNN, Kim Jong-il issued a warning to his military: “If warfare was about bullets and oil until now,” he told top commanders, according to a prominent defector, Kim Heung-kwang, “warfare in the 21st century is about information.”\n\nThe unit was marked initially by mishaps and bluster.\n\n“There was an enormous growth in capability from 2009 or so, when they were a joke,” said Ben Buchanan, the author of “The Cybersecurity Dilemma” and a fellow at the Cyber Security Project at Harvard. “They would execute a very basic attack against a minor web page put up by the White House or an American intelligence agency, and then their sympathizers would claim they’d hacked the U.S. government. But since then, their hackers have gotten a lot better.”\n\nA National Intelligence Estimate in 2009 wrote off the North’s hacking prowess, much as it underestimated its long-range missile program. It would be years before it could mount a meaningful threat, it claimed.\n\nBut the regime was building that threat.\n\nWhen Kim Jong-un succeeded his father, in 2011, he expanded the cybermission beyond serving as just a weapon of war, focusing also on theft, harassment and political-score settling.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Cyberwarfare, along with nuclear weapons and missiles, is an ‘all-purpose sword’ that guarantees our military’s capability to strike relentlessly,” Kim Jong-un reportedly declared, according to the testimony of a South Korean intelligence chief.\n\nAnd the array of United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang only incentivized Mr. Kim’s embrace.\n\n“We’re already sanctioning anything and everything we can,” said Robert P. Silvers, the former assistant secretary for cyberpolicy at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. “They’re already the most isolated nation in the world.”\n\nBy 2012, government officials and private researchers say North Korea had dispersed its hacking teams abroad, relying principally on China’s internet infrastructure. This allowed the North to exploit largely nonsecure internet connections and maintain a degree of plausible deniability.\n\nA recent analysis by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future found heavy North Korean internet activity in India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nepal, Kenya, Mozambique, and Indonesia. In some cases, like that of New Zealand, North Korean hackers were simply routing their attacks through the country’s computers from abroad. In others, researchers believe they are now physically stationed in countries like India, where nearly one-fifth of Pyongyang’s cyberattacks now originate.\n\nIntelligence agencies are now trying to track the North Korean hackers in these countries the way they have previously tracked terrorist sleeper cells or nuclear proliferators: looking for their favorite hotels, lurking in online forums they may inhabit, attempting to feed them bad computer code and counterattacking their own servers.\n\nPhoto\n\nLearning From Iran, Growing Bolder\n\nFor decades Iran and North Korea have shared missile technology, and American intelligence agencies have long sought evidence of secret cooperation in the nuclear arena. In cyber, the Iranians taught the North Koreans something important: When confronting an enemy that has internet-connected banks, trading systems, oil and water pipelines, dams, hospitals, and entire cities, the opportunities to wreak havoc are endless.\n\nBy midsummer 2012, Iran’s hackers, still recovering from an American and Israeli-led cyberattack on Iran’s nuclear enrichment operations, found an easy target in Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company and the world’s most valuable company.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThat August, Iranian hackers flipped a kill switch at precisely 11:08 a.m., unleashing a simple wiper virus onto 30,000 Aramco computers and 10,000 servers that would destroy data, and replace it with a partial image of a burning American flag. The damage was tremendous.\n\nSeven months later, during joint military exercises between American and South Korean forces, North Korean hackers, operating from computers inside China, deployed a very similar cyberweapon against computer networks at three major South Korean banks and South Korea’s two largest broadcasters. Like Iran’s Aramco attacks, the North Korean attacks on South Korean targets used wiping malware to eradicate data and paralyze their business operations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt may have been a copycat operation, but Mr. Hannigan, the former British official, said recently: “We have to assume they are getting help from the Iranians.”\n\nAnd inside the National Security Agency, just a few years after analysts had written off Pyongyang as a low grade threat, there was suddenly a new appreciation that the country was figuring out cyber just as it had figured out nuclear weapons: test by test.\n\n“North Korea showed that to achieve its political objectives, it will take down any company — period,” Mr. Silvers said.\n\nPhoto\n\nProtecting Kim’s Image\n\nA chief political objective of the cyberprogram is to preserve the image of the North’s 33-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un. In August 2014, North Korean hackers went after a British broadcaster, Channel Four, which had announced plans for a television series about a British nuclear scientist kidnapped in Pyongyang.\n\nFirst, the North Koreans protested to the British government. “A scandalous farce,” North Korea called the series. When that was ignored, British authorities found that the North had hacked into the television network’s computer system. The attack was stopped before inflicting any damage, and David Abraham, the chief executive of Channel Four, initially vowed to continue the production.\n\nThat attack, however, was just a prelude. When Sony Pictures Entertainment released a trailer for “The Interview,” a comedy about two journalists dispatched to Pyongyang to assassinate North Korea’s young new dictator, Pyongyang wrote a letter of complaint to the secretary general of the United Nations to stop the production. Then came threats to Sony.\n\nMichael Lynton, then Sony’s chief executive, said when Sony officials called the State Department, they were told it was just more “bluster,” he said.\n\n“At that point in time, Kim Jong-un was relatively new in the job, and I don’t think it was clear yet how he was different from his father,” Mr. Lynton said in an interview. “Nobody ever mentioned anything about their cyber capabilities.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn September 2014, while still attempting to crack Channel 4, North Korean hackers buried deep into Sony’s networks, lurking patiently for the next three months, as both Sony and American intelligence completely missed their presence.\n\nThe director of national intelligence, James Clapper, was even in Pyongyang at the time, trying to win the release of a detained American, and had dinner with the then-chief of the Reconnaissance General Bureau.\n\nOn Nov. 24, the attack on Sony began: Employees arriving at work that day found their computer screens taken over by a picture of a red skeleton with a message signed “GOP,” for “Guardians of Peace.”\n\n“We’ve obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secrets,” the message said. “If you don’t obey us, we’ll release data shown below to the world.”\n\nThat was actually a diversion: The code destroyed 70 percent of Sony Pictures’ laptops and computers. Sony employees were reduced to communicating via pen, paper and phone.\n\nMr. Lynton said the F.B.I. told him that nothing could have been done to prevent the attack, since it was waged by a sovereign state. “We learned that you really have no way of protecting yourself in any meaningful way,” he said of such nation-state attacks.\n\nSony struggled to distribute the film as theaters were intimidated. (Ultimately it was distributed for download, and may have done better than it would have.) In London, outside investors in Channel Four’s North Korea project suddenly dried up, and the project effectively died.\n\nThe Obama White House responded to the Sony hack with sanctions that the North barely noticed, but with no other retaliation. “A cyberbattle would be a lot more risky for the United States and its allies than for North Korea,” said Mr. Silvers.\n\nPhoto\n\nRobbing Banks, Pyongyang Style\n\nBeyond respect, and retribution, the North wanted hard currency from its cyberprogram.\n\nSo soon the digital bank heists began — an attack in the Philippines in October 2015; then the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam at the end of the same year; and then the Bangladesh Central Bank. Researchers at Symantec said it was the first time a state had used a cyberattack not for espionage or war, but to finance the country’s operations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, the attacks are increasingly cunning. Security experts noticed in February that the website of Poland’s financial regulator was unintentionally infecting visitors with malware.\n\nIt turned out that visitors to the Polish regulator’s website — employees from Polish banks, from the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Estonia, Mexico, Venezuela, and even from prominent Western banks like Bank of America — had been targeted with a so-called watering hole attack, in which North Korean hackers waited for their victims to visit the site, then installed malware in their machines. Forensics showed that the hackers had put together a list of internet addresses from 103 organizations, most of them banks, and designed their malware to specifically infect visitors from those banks, in what researchers said appeared to be an effort to move around stolen currency.\n\nMore recently, North Koreans seemed to have changed tack once again. North Korean hackers’ fingerprints showed up in a series of attempted attacks on so-called cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, and were successful in at least one case, according to researchers at FireEye.\n\nThe attacks on Bitcoin exchanges, which see hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin exchanged a day, offered Pyongyang a potentially very lucrative source of new funds. And, researchers say, there is evidence they have been exchanging Bitcoin gathered from their heists for Monero, a highly anonymous version of cryptocurrency that is far harder for global authorities to trace.\n\nThe most widespread hack was WannaCry, a global ransomware attack that used a program that cripples a computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for unlocking the computer, or its data. In a twist the North Koreans surely enjoyed, their hackers based the attack on a secret tool, called “Eternal Blue,” stolen from the National Security Agency.\n\nIn the late afternoon of May 12, panicked phone calls flooded in from around Britain and the world. The computer systems of several major British hospital systems were shut down, forcing diversions of ambulances and the deferral of nonemergency surgeries. Banks and transportation systems across dozens of countries were affected.\n\nBritain’s National Cyber Security Center had picked up no warning of the attack, said Paul Chichester, its director of operations. Investigators now think the WannaCry attack may have been an early misfire of a weapon that was still under development — or a test of tactics and vulnerabilities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“This was part of an evolving effort to find ways to disable key industries,” said Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at the Government Communications Headquarters in Britain. “All I have to do is create a moderately disabling attack on a key part of the social infrastructure, and then watch the media sensationalize it and panic the public.”\n\nIt ended thanks to Marcus Hutchins, a college dropout and self-taught hacker living with his parents in the southwest of England. He spotted a web address somewhere in the software and, on a lark, paid $10.69 to register it as a domain name. The activation of the domain name turned out to act as a kill switch causing the malware to stop spreading.\n\nBritish officials privately acknowledge that they know North Korea perpetrated the attack, but the government has taken no retaliatory action, uncertain what they can do.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Cyber Arms Race\n\nWhile American and South Korean officials often express outrage about North Korea’s cyberactivities, they rarely talk about their own — and whether that helps fuel the cyber arms race.\n\nYet both Seoul and Washington target the North’s Reconnaissance General Bureau, its nuclear program and its missile program. Hundreds, if not thousands, of American cyberwarriors spend each day mapping the North’s few networks, looking for vulnerabilities that could be activated in time of crisis.\n\nAt a recent meeting of American strategists to evaluate North Korea’s capabilities, some participants expressed concerns that the escalating cyberwar could actually tempt the North to use its weapons — both nuclear and cyber — very quickly in any conflict, for fear that the United States has secret ways to shut the country down.\n\nThe director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, said last week that the United States is trying to compile a better picture of the leadership around Kim Jong-un, for a report to President Trump. Figuring out who oversees cyber and special operations is a central mystery. The Japanese press recently speculated it could be an official named Jang Kil-su. Others are curious about Gen. No Kwang-chol, who was elevated to the Central Committee of the North’s ruling party in May 2016, and is one of the only members whose portfolio is undisclosed.\n\nThe big question is whether Mr. Kim, fearful that his nuclear program is becoming too large and obvious a target, is focusing instead on how to shut down the United States without ever lighting off a missile. “Everyone is focused on mushroom clouds,” Mr. Silvers said, “but there is far more potential for another kind of disastrous escalation.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/world/asia/north-korea-hacking-cyber-sony.html","1508040000.0"
"In Saudi Arabia, Trump Reaches Out to Sunni Nations, at Iran’s Expense\n“We are picking one side in this geopolitical struggle, and there is very little room for gray,” said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Sectarianism is a byproduct of this geopolitical rivalry, and we are inadvertently picking one side in this sectarian struggle.”\n\nThe two scenes — dancing in the streets in Tehran and Sunni leaders gathered in an opulent hall in Riyadh — also pointed to a complicating reality in the Middle East: There is often a disconnect between the leaders and their people.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Trump signaled his intention to end engagement with Iran, suggesting that it does not encourage change from inside the country.\n\nBut in Iran, many were pushing for change. Emboldened by the election results, crowds of Iranians in the capital, Tehran, demanded what they hope President Hassan Rouhani’s second term will bring: the release of opposition figures, more freedom of thought and fewer restrictions on daily life.\n\nMr. Rouhani’s supporters also expect his victory, with 57 percent of the vote, to bolster his outreach efforts to the West and the pursuit of more foreign investment to lift Iran’s ailing economy.\n\nFor those who voted for Mr. Rouhani, there was a feeling of tremendous relief that his challenger, the hard-line cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who criticized the nuclear deal with the United States and other Western powers, had lost.\n\n“Bye-bye, Raisi,” the crowds chanted during the street gatherings.\n\n“He faces a difficult task,” Fazel Meybodi, a Shiite Muslim cleric from the city of Qum, said of Mr. Rouhani. “Now he must provide more freedoms, break the hard-line monopoly on the state-run radio and television, and increase freedom of press.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo achieve all that, Mr. Rouhani must persuade the hard-line-dominated judiciary and security forces to change their outlook, Mr. Meybodi said. “If he fails to deliver on at least 70 percent of those promises, his future is dark,” he added.\n\nFor decades, Saudi Arabia and Iran have competed for religious leadership and political influence across the Muslim world and beyond.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the Sunni monarchy that controls Islam’s holiest sites, sees itself as the natural leader of the Muslim world and has used its lavish oil wealth to spread its austere version of the faith.\n\nIran, meanwhile, is the world’s largest Shiite nation and is led by clerics who seek to export the ideology of political Islam that brought them to power in 1979.\n\nEach country accuses the other of sowing instability.\n\nIran accuses Saudi Arabia of spreading an intolerant creed that fuels terrorism and threatens minorities. Saudi Arabia says Iran works through nonstate actors to weaken Arab nations.\n\nIn his speech on Sunday, Mr. Trump, a guest of the Saudi monarch, spoke of a stronger alliance with mostly Sunni Muslim nations to fight terrorism and extremist ideology and to push back against Iran.\n\nVideo\n\n“From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds arms and trains terrorists, militias and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region,” Mr. Trump told dozens of Muslim heads of state. “It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this very room.”\n\nThat pointed to a departure from the policies of Mr. Obama, who pushed Persian Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia to move toward greater self-sufficiency in defense while pressing for the agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProponents of that approach hoped that engagement with Iran would lead to greater moderation among its leaders, paving the way for its eventual reintegration into the world system.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut the nuclear deal angered gulf nations, who felt that it rewarded Iran for bad behavior while doing nothing to constrain its destabilizing activities in Arab countries.\n\nFor them, Mr. Trump’s return to America’s traditional allies was a great relief.\n\n“The most important thing is that the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States is built on vision and numbers, not on slogans. They are building on shared interests,” said Ghassan Charbel, the editor in chief of Asharq Al-Awsat, a Saudi-owned newspaper. “It shows that the majority in the Arab and Islamic worlds will be close to the United States if it chooses to engage.”\n\nThe Arab nations hate Iran for using nonstate actors in Arab countries. Iran was fundamental in the creation of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party that now has Lebanon’s strongest military force. More recently, Iran has sent military aid to help Mr. Assad fight rebels seeking his ouster, while also supporting militias in Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen.\n\nBut there is a gap between Iran’s older, ruling clerics and the ambitions of its people, as was made clear when Iranians came out in force to dance and protest in the streets this weekend, breaking Islamic rules and political taboos, in celebration of Mr. Rouhani’s re-election.\n\nThe election outcome was widely seen as evidence that Iran’s society has changed radically. Influenced by satellite television, cheaper international travel, the internet, waves of migration to big cities and access to higher education, most of Iranian society now adheres to middle-class values.\n\nThis collided with the anti-Western ideology and strict interpretation of Islam represented by Mr. Raisi and promoted by state organizations.\n\nSome used the election’s success to criticize Mr. Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Iran — fresh from real elections — attacked by @POTUS in that bastion of democracy & moderation,” Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, wrote on Twitter, speaking of Saudi Arabia.\n\nHamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst, said of Mr. Trump, “This man just wants to sell American weapons and use Iran as an excuse.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn deepening the United States’ alliance with gulf countries, Mr. Trump is bringing it closer to nations that share few cultural values with the United States and have sometimes acted against its interests.\n\nSaudi Arabia, for one, is a monarchy where citizens have few rights and the public practice of any religion other than Islam is banned. It has used its military and its oil wealth to protect the Sunni monarchy that rules over a Shiite majority in neighboring Bahrain and to prop up President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt.\n\nIn adopting the gulf perspective on Iran, Mr. Trump could be assisting a strategy gulf leaders use when times get hard at home.\n\n“It is feeding into the gulf narrative, where they project a lot of their insecurities about domestic politics outward and onto the Islamic Republic of Iran,” said Mr. Wehrey, the Carnegie fellow. “But is Iran the source of all evil in the region? No.”\n\nOthers questioned the value of working with autocrats to fight terrorism.\n\n“The worldview that we are fighting against needs to be countered with liberal ideas, not Salafi ideas,” said Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow in the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, referring to Saudi Arabia’s conservative branch of Islam.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-donald-trump.html","1495339200.0"
"Soldier is accused of killing his wife and a New York state trooper, police say\nU.S. Army soldier Justin Walters, 32, has been charged with first and second degree murder. He's accused of killing his wife and a New York State Police trooper on Sunday, July 9. (Reuters)\n\nA U.S. Army soldier killed his wife and a New York state trooper outside the infantryman’s home near Fort Drum on Sunday night, according to police.\n\nJustin Dean Walters, a staff sergeant who served 10 years in the Army, lived with his wife off a county road in Theresa, N.Y. — not far from the Canadian border, and minutes from the base where he was stationed after two tours in Afghanistan.\n\nSomeone called 911 from the residence about 8 p.m., police said, and said shots were fired.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, New York State Police Trooper Joel Davis pulled up and parked about 75 feet from the house. He was the first of several officers dispatched to the scene.\n\nDavis was well known in the community, State Police Superintendent George Beach later told reporters.\n\nHe had served nearly a decade with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office before becoming a state trooper four years ago, had three kids and helped run a youth baseball league.\n\n“In these communities, our state troopers are literally our protectors,” Beach said at a news conference Monday, as he explained how Davis died.\n\nAfter getting out of his vehicle, Beach said, the trooper radioed that someone was firing a gun.\n\nWith a bulletproof vest on and backup troopers minutes away, he left his vehicle and walked toward the home.\n\nBefore he reached it, a police report says, Davis encountered Walters in the driveway, holding a rifle.\n\nIt’s unknown what, if anything, transpired between the two men.\n\nWalters shot Davis once in the chest, police said. The round hit his vest from the side and somehow got past the protective plate, and he fell.\n\nA second trooper arrived no more than three minutes later.\n\nHe didn’t see Davis anywhere outside, the superintendent said. But he saw Walters in the driveway, and heard gunfire.\n\nWith his own weapon drawn, the trooper stepped out of his vehicle. He spotted Davis then, dead or dying in a ditch.\n\nBut there was no more bloodshed that night. Walters raised his hands and surrendered, Beach said.\n\nMore troopers came. They found 27-year-old Nichole Walters lying dead in the driveway, shot multiple times.\n\nAnother woman — a friend of Nichole’s, Beach said — had been shot on the same property but would recover.\n\nDavis would die at a hospital, less than an hour after he arrived at Walters’s home.\n\nA toddler in the Walters home was taken by child protective services, according to the Watertown Daily Times.\n\nBeach said investigators seized “a number of weapons” and didn’t know which one had killed Davis or Nichole Walters.\n\nThe soldier was charged with two counts of murder — first-degree for the officer, and second-degree for his wife.\n\nSpectrum News showed troopers leading the infantryman, shirtless and shoeless, into LeRay Town Court.\n\nBut his arraignment had to be delayed after Walters failed to answer the judge’s questions.\n\n“I’m not asking you whether or not you’re guilty of this charge,” the judge tells Walters in Spectrum’s footage from the courtroom. “I’m simply asking you whether or not you understand why you’re here.”\n\n“I do not, sir,” Walters replied.\n\nHe had no lawyer, according to the court.\n\n[Parolee’s anger at police may have led to shooting]\n\nThe soldier and his wife\n\nNichole Walters met her husband around the time she graduated from high school in New York, a friend told the Associated Press.\n\nThe friend said she was raising a little boy with her husband.\n\nMilitary records show Walters enlisted in the Army in 2007 at age 23. He served two year-long tours in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012, during which medals indicate he probably saw combat.\n\nNow 32, he is a staff sergeant stationed at Fort Drum. Noncommissioned officers with his rank typically oversee a squad of fewer than a dozen soldiers in an infantry unit.\n\n“He did his job and never complained. He was a good soldier when I was there,” said a soldier who served with Walters at Fort Drum and requested anonymity to discuss his relationship with Walters.\n\nThe soldiers served together in the same squad during Walters’s first tour in Afghanistan in 2009, where the unit saw heavy combat, the soldier said.\n\nThe soldier met Walters’s wife, Nichole, before he was reassigned to another installation.\n\n“She seemed like a good person,” the soldier said. “She was always there for him,” he added, including Walters’s second tour in Afghanistan.\n\nThe soldier did not know about the killings until he was contacted by The Washington Post.\n\n“It really is a shame. It’s tragic,” he said.\n\nA study by the Rand Corp. estimated that 18.5 percent of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan show signs of post-traumatic stress or major depression.\n\nBut the Department of Veterans Affairs has said there is no causal link between post-traumatic stress and homicide. And it was not clear whether Walters had any mental health issues from his two Afghanistan combat deployments.\n\nBeach said his investigators were talking to base officials about Walters’s history, trying to find out whether he had mental issues — but “I don’t know that conclusively.”\n\nThe fallen trooper\n\nDavis, 36, hailed from Evans Mills, N.Y. He left behind a wife and three children — ages 18, 17 and 13, according to the police superintendent.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years with the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, Davis joined the troopers in 2013. He was assigned first to Watertown, then to Philadelphia — both towns in the same county.\n\nReached by phone, Davis’s wife said the family wasn’t ready to talk about him in public.\n\n“He was a good husband and father,” Beach told reporters in Watertown on Monday afternoon. “This will be our fourth member who has suffered fatal injuries or died from a 9-11 related illness in the last year.”\n\n“This has a terrible effect on everybody,” the superintendent added.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued his own sympathies, and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, beginning Wednesday and until Davis is buried.\n\nThis article has been updated.\n\n\n\nTrooper Joel Davis, 36, was shot and killed in the line of duty.

"Syrian man jailed over Hungary border riot despite pleading for calm\nLondon (CNN) Thousands of refugees and migrants, most fleeing violence in the Middle East, mass at the sealed-off border, chanting 'Open! Open!' They are desperate to cross into Hungary, but a razor-wire fence, temporary blockade and a line of riot police stand in their way.\n\nAs tensions escalate, one voice rises above the fray: A balding, bearded man, wearing a black and white tracksuit top, attempts to negotiate with the officers. 'Nobody will make any problem to your country,' he tells the officers at Horgos, near the town of Roszke, using a loudspeaker. 'Nobody will make any problem to any policeman. You must understand this -- we come here for peace, just to pass.'\n\nAs he makes his appeal, the man points into the distance, appearing to indicate that the migrants hope only to pass through the Hungary-Serbia border on their way to other countries in the European Union.\n\nAhmed H. speaking to riot police from behind a blockade on September 16, 2015.\n\nFootage of the incident, recorded by the Hungarian news site Index.hu in September 2015, shows the man stepping back from the temporary barrier before clashes break out. Migrants can be seen hurling objects at the police and forcing open the border gate. In response, riot police fire tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd.\n\nThe man, identified in court as 'Ahmed H.,' was sentenced to 10 years in prison Wednesday for taking part in the riot.\n\n'Act of terror'\n\nA court in Szeged, Hungary, this week found him guilty of using violence -- throwing rocks -- to force police into opening the border, deemed an 'act of terror' under Hungarian law.\n\nIt also convicted Ahmed H., a Syrian who lives in Cyprus with his wife and children, of entering Hungary illegally. The 40-year-old is an EU resident and so could have crossed the Hungarian border legally.\n\nHe says he was there that day to help his elderly Syrian parents and other relatives, as they navigated their way along the Balkans route from Turkey to Germany. His parents were among a group arrested for allegedly taking part in the rioting.\n\nAhmed H. awaits the verdict in his trial at the court in Szeged, Hungary, on November 30, 2016.\n\n'It was heartbreaking to see a man stand and face the wrath of the state,' says Kartik Raj, Amnesty International's Europe Campaigner. 'It's unthinkable that he deserves 10 years in prison for effectively coming to the aid of his elderly parents and family fleeing Syria.'\n\n'It's a sadly predictable result in the context of the Hungarian government's appalling crackdown on the rights of migrants, twinned with this escalated, ramped up approach to terrorism law,' Raj added.\n\nAmnesty International has called the verdict an 'alarming' application of the country's anti-terrorism laws, which have tightened in recent months.\n\nThe case is emblematic of the Hungarian government's hardline stance on refugees, which has fueled xenophobic sentiment in the nation.\n\nTough immigration rules\n\nAnna Winogradowna, an activist with the Migrant Solidarity Group of Hungary (Migszol), was among a small group of protesters who demonstrated against Wednesday's verdict in Szeged.\n\n'All the accusations against Ahmed were trying to conflate his being a Muslim with him being a terrorist,' Winogradowna said. 'This connection that they're making -- Islam equates terrorism -- that's very symptomatic of the whole rhetoric in the country.'\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has previously said that 'every single migrant poses a public security and terror risk.'\n\nAhmed H. stands in court on November 30, 2016, flanked by a balaclava-wearing guard.\n\nHungary has been heavily criticized for its tough immigration measures since shuttering its border last September.\n\nIn addition to erecting an anti-refugee fence, the country has also criminalized the act of entering Hungary illegally -- a law that breaches international asylum treaties and under which Ahmed H. was convicted. Hungary has also started recruiting for 3,000 new 'border hunters' to patrol the frontier with the police and army.\n\nOrban championed a campaign asking Hungarians to reject EU migrant quotas for the country in a controversial referendum in October.\n\nA government-financed booklet distributed to Hungarian households as part of the campaign reportedly linked migration to increased terrorism. Orban ultimately hailed the country's referendum as a victory, despite a low voter turnout that rendered its result invalid.\n\nAppeal for harsher sentence\n\nThe Prime Minister's communications office told CNN in an email: 'We do not wish to comment on ongoing cases, only after a final judgment was made,' adding 'please remember that it was not the Government but the independent Hungarian judiciary that made this decision based on sound and video recordings as well as testimonies.'\n\nAhmed H. was captured in photographs and footage by a number of other news agencies on September 16, 2015 -- one day after the Hungary-Serbia border was closed. Dozens of police officers, migrants and some journalists were injured in the violence on the same day.\n\nA video filmed by the Kremlin-backed broadcaster Russia Today shows Ahmed H. shaking his finger at riot police, saying, 'No, no,' before violence broke out.\n\nOther footage, broadcast by Spain's TVE , shows him standing between police and a crowd of women and children. He can be heard telling reporters: 'We want only peace.'\n\nBoth the prosecution and defense intend to appeal the verdict. The defense is seeking an acquittal, while the prosecution is hoping for a harsher sentence.\n\nSpeaking at the Hungarian Permanent Conference in Budapest on Thursday, Orban welcomed the conviction.","https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/europe/syrian-man-border-riot-terror/index.html","1480654800.0"
"Killing C.I.A. Informants, China Crippled U.S. Spying Operations\nThe previously unreported episode shows how successful the Chinese were in disrupting American spying efforts and stealing secrets years before a well-publicized breach in 2015 gave Beijing access to thousands of government personnel records, including intelligence contractors. The C.I.A. considers spying in China one of its top priorities, but the country’s extensive security apparatus makes it exceptionally hard for Western spy services to develop sources there.\n\nAt a time when the C.I.A. is trying to figure out how some of its most sensitive documents were leaked onto the internet two months ago by WikiLeaks, and the F.B.I. investigates possible ties between President Trump’s campaign and Russia, the unsettled nature of the China investigation demonstrates the difficulty of conducting counterespionage investigations into sophisticated spy services like those in Russia and China.\n\nThe C.I.A. and the F.B.I. both declined to comment.\n\nDetails about the investigation have been tightly held. Ten current and former American officials described the investigation on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing the information.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first signs of trouble emerged in 2010. At the time, the quality of the C.I.A.’s information about the inner workings of the Chinese government was the best it had been for years, the result of recruiting sources deep inside the bureaucracy in Beijing, four former officials said. Some were Chinese nationals who the C.I.A. believed had become disillusioned with the Chinese government’s corruption.\n\nBut by the end of the year, the flow of information began to dry up. By early 2011, senior agency officers realized they had a problem: Assets in China, one of their most precious resources, were disappearing.\n\nThe F.B.I. and the C.I.A. opened a joint investigation run by top counterintelligence officials at both agencies. Working out of a secret office in Northern Virginia, they began analyzing every operation being run in Beijing. One former senior American official said the investigation had been code-named Honey Badger.\n\nAs more and more sources vanished, the operation took on increased urgency. Nearly every employee at the American Embassy was scrutinized, no matter how high ranking. Some investigators believed the Chinese had cracked the encrypted method that the C.I.A. used to communicate with its assets. Others suspected a traitor in the C.I.A., a theory that agency officials were at first reluctant to embrace — and that some in both agencies still do not believe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTheir debates were punctuated with macabre phone calls — “We lost another one” — and urgent questions from the Obama administration wondering why intelligence about the Chinese had slowed.\n\nThe mole hunt eventually zeroed in on a former agency operative who had worked in the C.I.A.’s division overseeing China, believing he was most likely responsible for the crippling disclosures. But efforts to gather enough evidence to arrest him failed, and he is now living in another Asian country, current and former officials said.\n\nThere was good reason to suspect an insider, some former officials say. Around that time, Chinese spies compromised National Security Agency surveillance in Taiwan — an island Beijing claims is part of China — by infiltrating Taiwanese intelligence, an American partner, according to two former officials. And the C.I.A. had discovered Chinese operatives in the agency’s hiring pipeline, according to officials and court documents.\n\nBut the C.I.A.’s top spy hunter, Mark Kelton, resisted the mole theory, at least initially, former officials say. Mr. Kelton had been close friends with Brian J. Kelley, a C.I.A. officer who in the 1990s was wrongly suspected by the F.B.I. of being a Russian spy. The real traitor, it turned out, was Mr. Hanssen. Mr. Kelton often mentioned Mr. Kelley’s mistreatment in meetings during the China episode, former colleagues say, and said he would not accuse someone without ironclad evidence.\n\nThose who rejected the mole theory attributed the losses to sloppy American tradecraft at a time when the Chinese were becoming better at monitoring American espionage activities in the country. Some F.B.I. agents became convinced that C.I.A. handlers in Beijing too often traveled the same routes to the same meeting points, which would have helped China’s vast surveillance network identify the spies in its midst.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSome officers met their sources at a restaurant where Chinese agents had planted listening devices, former officials said, and even the waiters worked for Chinese intelligence.\n\nThis carelessness, coupled with the possibility that the Chinese had hacked the covert communications channel, would explain many, if not all, of the disappearances and deaths, some former officials said. Some in the agency, particularly those who had helped build the spy network, resisted this theory and believed they had been caught in the middle of a turf war within the C.I.A.\n\nStill, the Chinese picked off more and more of the agency’s spies, continuing through 2011 and into 2012. As investigators narrowed the list of suspects with access to the information, they started focusing on a Chinese-American who had left the C.I.A. shortly before the intelligence losses began. Some investigators believed he had become disgruntled and had begun spying for China. One official said the man had access to the identities of C.I.A. informants and fit all the indicators on a matrix used to identify espionage threats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter leaving the C.I.A., the man decided to remain in Asia with his family and pursue a business opportunity, which some officials suspect that Chinese intelligence agents had arranged.\n\nOfficials said the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. lured the man back to the United States around 2012 with a ruse about a possible contract with the agency, an arrangement common among former officers. Agents questioned the man, asking why he had decided to stay in Asia, concerned that he possessed a number of secrets that would be valuable to the Chinese. It’s not clear whether agents confronted the man about whether he had spied for China.\n\nThe man defended his reasons for living in Asia and did not admit any wrongdoing, an official said. He then returned to Asia.\n\nBy 2013, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. concluded that China’s success in identifying C.I.A. agents had been blunted — it is not clear how — but the damage had been done.\n\nThe C.I.A. has tried to rebuild its network of spies in China, officials said, an expensive and time-consuming effort led at one time by the former chief of the East Asia Division. A former intelligence official said the former chief was particularly bitter because he had worked with the suspected mole and recruited some of the spies in China who were ultimately executed.\n\nChina has been particularly aggressive in its espionage in recent years, beyond the breach of the Office of Personnel Management records in 2015, American officials said. Last year, an F.B.I. employee pleaded guilty to acting as a Chinese agent for years, passing sensitive technology information to Beijing in exchange for cash, lavish hotel rooms during foreign travel and prostitutes.\n\nIn March, prosecutors announced the arrest of a longtime State Department employee, Candace Marie Claiborne, accused of lying to investigators about her contacts with Chinese officials. According to the criminal complaint against Ms. Claiborne, who pleaded not guilty, Chinese agents wired cash into her bank account and showered her with gifts that included an iPhone, a laptop and tuition at a Chinese fashion school. In addition, according to the complaint, she received a fully furnished apartment and a stipend.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html","1495252800.0"
"U.S. indicts suspected Russian 'mastermind' of $4 billion bitcoin laundering scheme\nNEW YORK/ATHENS/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A U.S. jury indicted a Russian man on Wednesday as the operator of a digital currency exchange he allegedly used to launder more than $4 billion for people involved in crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking.\n\nAlexander Vinnik was arrested in a small beachside village in northern Greece on Tuesday, according to local authorities, following an investigation led by the U.S. Justice Department along with several other federal agencies and task forces.\n\nU.S. officials described Vinnik in a Justice Department statement as the operator of BTC-e, an exchange used to trade the digital currency bitcoin since 2011.\n\nThey alleged Vinnik and his firm “received” more than $4 billion in bitcoin and did substantial business in the United States without following appropriate protocols to protect against money laundering and other crimes.\n\nU.S. authorities also linked him to the failure of Mt. Gox, a Japan-based bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014 after being hacked. Vinnik “obtained” funds from the hack of Mt. Gox and laundered them through BTC-e and Tradehill, another San Francisco-based exchange he owned, they said in the statement.\n\nIt was not possible to reach Vinnik for comment.\n\n“Just as new computer technologies continue to change the way we engage each other and experience the world, so too will criminals subvert these new technologies to serve their own nefarious purposes,” said Brian Stretch, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, where Vinnick was indicted in the statement.\n\nGreek police described Vinnik as a “an internationally sought ‘mastermind’ of a crime organization.”\n\nHis arrest is the latest in a series of U.S. operations against Russian cyber criminals in Europe. Last week, the U.S. Justice Department moved to shut down the dark web marketplace AlphaBay.\n\nRelated Coverage Russian indicted in U.S. on charges of running bitcoin laundering ring\n\nThe prosecutions also coincide with intensified scrutiny of Russian hackers after U.S. intelligence officials determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election using cyber warfare methods to help Donald Trump, something Moscow denies.\n\nBitcoin was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and pseudonymous, making conventional financial regulation difficult.\n\nOver the years, law enforcement agencies around the world have been able to identify users behind pseudonymous wallets connected to illegal activities by tracking bitcoin movements, often with the help of crypto-currency experts.\n\nWhile bitcoins can be bought and spent anonymously using digital wallets with unique addresses, transactions are recorded on a public ledger called blockchain, making it possible to follow the coins.\n\nMt. Gox was one of the most prominent examples of how the lightly regulated cybercurrency market could burn investors, after an estimated $450 million worth of bitcoin and $27 million in hard cash vanished when it collapsed.\n\nDuring his time in the digital currency market, U.S. authorities allege Vinnik facilitated crimes including hacking, fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud, public corruption and drug trafficking.\n\nBTC-e, which has been out of service for more than a day, attributed this to “unplanned maintenance.” In a tweet on Wednesday after the arrest of Vinnik, BTC-e said it would restore service in the next 5-10 days.\n\nAlexander Vinnik, a 38 year old Russian man (2nd L) suspected of running a money laundering operation, is escorted by plain-clothes police officers to a court in Thessaloniki, Greece July 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alexandros Avramidis\n\nThe exchange is one of the oldest virtual currency platforms. It allows users to trade bitcoin pseudonymously against a variety of fiat and virtual currencies, and is known in crypto-currency markets as having relaxed standards for checking users’ identity, and for not collaborating with law enforcement.\n\nUntil news of Vinnik’s arrest, the identity of anyone behind it had been unknown.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-russia-arrest-idUSKBN1AB1OP","1501160215.0"

"Massive leak exposes data on 123 million U.S. households\nThe door to your personal data got left wide open once again.\n\nResearchers revealed Tuesday that earlier this year they discovered a massive database -- containing information on more than 123 million American households -- that was sitting unsecured on the internet.\n\nThe cloud-based data repository from marketing analytics company Alteryx exposed a wide range of personal details about virtually every American household, according to researchers at cybersecurity company UpGuard. The leak put consumers at risk for a range of nefarious activities, from spamming to identity theft, the researchers warned.\n\nThough no names were exposed, the data set included 248 different data fields covering a wide variety of specific personal information including address, age, gender, education, occupation and marital status. Other fields included mortgage and financial information, phone numbers and the number of children in the household.\n\n'From home addresses and contact information, to mortgage ownership and financial histories, to very specific analysis of purchasing behavior, the exposed data constitutes a remarkably invasive glimpse into the lives of American consumers,' UpGuard researchers Chris Vickery and Dan O'Sullivan wrote in their analysis.\n\nA cascade of recent database breaches has left consumers on edge about the security of their personal information. After credit monitoring company Equifax revealed in September that cybercriminals had made off with data on more than 145 million Americans, U.S. lawmakers began efforts to hold such businesses accountable to the everyday people whose data they collect for profit.\n\nThe Alteryx database was discovered in October in a misconfigured Amazon Web Services S3 cloud storage 'bucket,' the researchers said, allowing access to anyone with an easily obtainable account.\n\nThe repository contained massive data sets belonging to Alteryx partner Experian, a consumer credit reporting agency that competes with Equifax and the U.S. Census Bureau, researchers said. Alteryx apparently purchased the data from Experian's Consumer View marketing database, which is a product sold to other companies that contains a combination of publicly available information and more personal data.\n\nNeither Alteryx nor Experian responded to a request for comment. In a statement to Forbes, Alteryx said the database had been secured, and it downplayed the leak's severity.\n\n'Specifically, this file held marketing data, including aggregated and de-identified information based on models and estimations provided by a third-party content provider, and was made available to our customers who purchased and used this data for analytic purposes,' Alteryx said. 'The information in the file does not pose a risk of identity theft to any consumers.'\n\nExperian struck a similar note in response to Forbes' query about the leak.\n\n'This is an Alteryx issue, and does not involve any Experian systems,' a spokesperson said. 'Alteryx has already confirmed with you that the data in question contained no names of any individuals or any other personal identifying information, and does not pose any risk of identity theft to any consumers. We have been assured by Alteryx that they promptly remedied this issue.'\n\nThe UpGuard researchers disagreed with that assessment.\n\n'The data exposed in this bucket would be invaluable for unscrupulous marketers, spammers and identity thieves, for whom this data would be largely reliable and, more importantly, varied,' the researchers said. 'With a large database of potential victims to survey -- with such details as 'mortgage ownership' revealed, a common security verification question -- the price could be far higher than merely bad publicity.'\n\nThis article was originally published on CNET.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alteryx-exposes-data-on-123-million-u-s-households/","None"
"Military retirement is about to get a lot more complex\nMore than 1 million members of the military will start 2018 needing to make an important financial decision, as the government rolls out the biggest change to military retirement since World War II.\n\nMembers of the US Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard with fewer than 12 years of service will have to choose whether to stay on an all-or-nothing path toward a traditional pension after 20 years of service or to opt for a new 'blended' retirement system that Congress approved as part of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nThe new system combines a 401(k)-style plan with a continuation bonus after 12 years of service and a traditional pension (albeit less generous than before) after 20 years. The upshot: Those who don't reach the 20-year milestone required to qualify for a pension -- which amounts to more than 80 percent of those who serve -- will no longer leave with nothing saved for retirement.\n\nUnder the new plan, those who do stay for 20 or more years will see a 20 percent cut in their pension payouts, though the difference should be offset in part by the contributions to the plan's 401(k)-style component. The changes, which amount to a test case for entitlement reform in the civilian world, are expected to save taxpayers billions and also boost recruitment efforts for millennials, who tend to change jobs more often but are reluctant about putting off saving for retirement.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch discussed the changes with Michael J. Meese, a retired Army brigadier general and current executive vice president and secretary of the nonprofit American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association, or AAFMAA. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMoneyWatch: These are big changes. Who are the winners and the losers?\n\nMeese: The winners are anybody who leaves the service short of 20 years. Previously, in the old system, the military had a very generous retirement system, but if you left short of 20 years -- which about 83 percent of those serving in the military did -- you left the military with nothing for your retirement savings.\n\nMilitary retirement is now going to be modernized so that starting immediately after you join, the military is going to contribute an automatic 1 percent of your salary and will match up to another 4 percent, for a total of 5 percent of your salary. And then you vest after two years and take that with you.\n\nMoneyWatch: What does this mean for those who do stay for 20 years? Does the pension phase out?\n\nMeese: If you stay for a career, you still have a generous pension, but it's 20 percent smaller at 20 years than it would have been previously. For example, in the old system if you stayed for 20 years, you would get 50 percent of your salary after 20 years. In the new system, you'll only get 40 percent of your salary, but you will have benefited from the fact the military has contributed matching funds throughout your career.\n\nMoneyWatch: It's surprising, and sad, that 83 percent of service members leave with nothing for retirement. So this seems like a positive for those folks.\n\nMeese: Another positive, for everybody as well as taxpayers, is it's forecast to save about $2 billion a year in terms of retirement costs. It really is the first time the government has done entitlement reform. When military retirement was set up, kind of like with Social Security, people were living into their 60s. Now they're living into their 80s. By curling back the defined-benefit pension at 20 years, it saves taxpayers quite a bit of money.\n\nMoneyWatch: Does this apply to new service members only, or everyone?\n\nMeese: It applies to everyone who joins the service after the first of January. If you have greater than 12 years in the military, you're grandfathered into the legacy system. There are between 1.1 million and 1.6 million people who have less than 12 years of service and have to make a choice sometime during calendar year 2018, whether to opt into new system or stay in the legacy system.\n\nIf you do not make an affirmative choice to go to the less-generous pension system, then you will stay in the legacy system and not get the defined contribution.\n\nMoneyWatch: What was the impetus for the change? Is this going to benefit any private-sector businesses?\n\nMeese: It initiated with a 2011 Defense Business Board report, and then there was some additional study by experts at West Point. It was a government commission, the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission, that recommended this proposal, which was eventually adopted in a bipartisan way in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016. It really was just good government.\n\nAfter World War II, if people were joining the military, you thought of them either as career military or just going in for a short amount of time, so they didn't care about retirement. This change really adapted our compensation and retirement system for the millennial generation.\n\nPeople in their first job expect to have some sort of 401(k) kind of plan. In that sense, it was entitlement reform where the military met millennials. There isn't a huge private-sector component to it, because both the military person's funds and the government matching contributions go into the Thrift Savings Plan, a government-administered retirement system established in the 1980s for civil servants.\n\nMoneyWatch: Do you anticipate a smooth rollout? Is it widely known already among members of the military?\n\nMeese: There still is a fair amount of confusion. There are some complicated parts. It's not hard if you take a look at it, but like many of these things involved in finances, the devil is in the details. You have to know what to look for and ask the right questions.\n\nMoneyWatch: What does this do in terms of fairness and equity for military members compared to their non-military peers?\n\nMeese: It should be a helpful and attractive recruiting tool for young men and women to consider joining the military and seeing they have a good 401(k)-type plan with matching contributions. Two years from now, once implemented, people who may have joined the military before before because of money for college, will see it's a good first opportunity. Even if they serve for three years, they've got a jump-start on retirement savings. Hopefully it'll continue to attract quality people to our military.\n\nMoneyWatch: Folks won't spend 15 years and leave with nothing.\n\nMeese: The all-volunteer force was implemented in 1973, but we never updated the retirement system to reflect we have a much more professional force that's serving for a longer period of time.\n\nMoneyWatch: What's your advice to service members who have an option here?\n\nMeese: It's a very difficult and personal decision, and it depends on how likely you think you are to stay for an entire career. As we have counseled at the American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association, if you're sure you're going to opt in, you should opt in right away so you get the match for January.\n\nIf you're not sure, and you're able to put the 5 percent in for matching funds, the new system will ensure that you have the defined contribution, and the pension, while smaller, is still fairly generous. If you make the wrong decision, and you stay for a whole career, the worst case is you get a pension that is still pretty substantial plus you've had the benefit of matching funds.\n\nIf you've got four years in and are absolutely sure you're going to stay for a career, and then five years from now something happens, you're not able to stay, or you don't get a good promotion, you leave with nothing. Choosing the least bad option probably means opting into the new system.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/military-retirement-plan/","None"
"Court rejects calls to reinstate food, water to Manus Island refugees\n(CNN) Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court has rejected an application that would have seen food and water provided to 600 refugees and asylum seekers who've been without adequate provisions for seven days.\n\nThe application, filed on behalf of Kurdish refugee Behrouz Boochani, had sought to ease a standoff at the Manus Island immigration detention center which started last Tuesday, when the center was formally closed.\n\nFood, water and power was cut to the site, and the refugees, who fear they'll be attacked by locals if they leave, have been surviving off water dug from their own well.\n\n'Depriving refugees from having access to basic and vital things is completely against humanity,' Boochani told CNN by text after the ruling.\n\n'This order shows how we are forgotten people and there is no justice for us,' said Boochani, who was sent to the Australian-run immigration processing center in 2013 after fleeing persecution in Iran.\n\nAround 600 men have been refusing to leave the Manus Island detention center in Papua New Guinea.\n\nWhile the Chief Justice found Boochani's human rights may have been breached, he indicated that new facilities being provided for the refugees would remedy the situation, Barrister Greg Barns told CNN after the ruling.\n\nThe refugees, however, say their issue is not with the new facilities, but the security surrounding them. Unlike the existing facility, which is located on a secured site far from residential areas, the new facilities are located in the town of Lorengau.\n\nThe refugees fear being attacked by angry locals who don't want them living in their town. In the past, they've been slashed with machetes and robbed of their mobile phones, according to the men and recent Human Rights Watch report.\n\nLawyers will be visiting the new sites to see if they're suitable and, if not, will challenge the ruling, Barns said.\n\nProtests during Melbourne Cup\n\nPrior to the ruling, refugee advocates staged multiple protests across Melbourne to attract the attention of Australians celebrating the annual Melbourne Cup horse race.\n\nThe annual sporting event is a major occasion across Australia, referred to as 'the race that stops a nation,' and attracts tens of thousands of attendees as well as millions more watching on television and online.\n\nTwo women climbed to the top of a crane within sight of Flemington racecourse, where the race is held, and unfurled a banner reading 'SOS -- Evacuate Manus Now.'\n\nJUST IN: 'SOS: Evacuate Manus Now!' -- Protesters scale a crane and unfurl a banner at Flemington. #7News pic.twitter.com/g8TwburdRH — 7 News Melbourne (@7NewsMelbourne) November 7, 2017\n\nMeanwhile protestors parked a car across the train tracks carrying racegoers towards Flemington, covered in writing which read 'Evacuate Manus.'\n\nVideo posted by CNN-affiliate Seven News showed the activists at the train track being arrested by police, while photos on social media showed officers climbing the crane to arrest the other protestors.\n\nVictoria Police posted on their social media a notice saying they had increased patrols at the racecourse in response to the ongoing protests across the area.\n\nNo resolution in sight\n\nFor months, the refugees and asylum seekers -- all men -- have been warned to leave the center ahead of the October 31 closure and move to the three new centers.\n\nRights advocates reacted with outrage to the ruling, which they said was exacerbating a humanitarian crisis.\n\n'The decision of the PNG Supreme Court decision does not alter the inhumanity of the siege on Manus Island, nor alter the role of the Australian government,' said Ian Rintoul, spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition.\n\n'It does not alter the fact that Manus is unsafe, and settlement in PNG is impossible. The onus is still on the government to provide the safety and security that the refugees and asylum seekers need.'\n\nRefugees at the Manus Island detention center pull water from a well they dug in the center grounds, November 1.\n\nElaine Pearson from Human Rights Watch said the men need urgent food, water and medical care, and that it was Australia's responsibility to bring them to safety.\n\n'(Australian) Prime Minister Turnbull can't turn a blind eye to the well-founded safety concerns these men have. Moving hundreds of men to a town where refugees have been beaten, stabbed and robbed is incredibly irresponsible,' she said.\n\nPNG police have been preventing anyone from approaching the center with food supplies, under the orders of the Commanding Officer of the Lombrum Naval Base.\n\n'Police and Military Police are enforcing the Commanding Officer Directives to deal with unnecessary people coming into the base to feed the refugees at the center,' Chief Superintendent Dominic D. Kakas said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe Australian government has said the men had been clearly warned for months that food and other necessities would be cut off after October 31, and that they should move to alternative accommodation.\n\nThe center closed after a PNG court ruling last April that the mens' detention breached their right to liberty.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/06/asia/manus-island-png-court-ruling/index.html","1509944400.0"
"Why the far right believes a US civil war will start on Saturday\nSince late September, ‘alt-right’ members have advanced the idea that anti-fascist groups will begin a violent insurrection on 4 November. But no antifa groups are planning to protest – so what gives?\n\nWhy the far right believes a US civil war will start on Saturday\n\nWhy the far right believes a US civil war will start on Saturday\n\nIf you are inside the “alt-right” information bubble, you might be preparing yourself for a civil war to commence this Saturday.\n\nSince late September, the idea has been circulating on Facebook groups, subreddit message boards, Twitter, and leading conspiracy media outlets that on 4 November, anti-fascist groups will begin a violent insurrection.\n\nDistract and dismiss: how rightwing media saw the Russia indictments Read more\n\nSome websites are telling their readers that antifa groups are “planning to kill every single Trump voter, Conservative and gun owner” this weekend. Hundreds of Facebook posts show how seriously consumers of such media are taking the news, and comments like “One more threat against white people and I swear to God I’m going to take a goddamn car and run over every fucking one of them” are not unrepresentative of the response.\n\nBut antifa groups have no plans to protest that day, and the small leftist groups who are planning protests have only dubious connections to the antifa movement. So what gives?\n\nThe whole thing rests on some very slender reeds, according to Spencer Sunshine, who recently wrote a report on the theories for the far right-monitoring group Political Research Associates. In the conspiracy underground on YouTube, he explains, there has been talk that “there was going to be a civil war” starting in November for some months.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An example of a youtube user arguing a civil war is near.\n\nBeginning in late September, three things kicked it a into higher gear. First, Refuse Fascism, a small group linked to the Revolutionary Communist party, staged a visually spectacular protest in Los Angeles. They blocked the 101 freeway and held up signs that enigmatically spelled out “Nov 4 it begins”. This is the same group that is organizing a series of protests around the country against the “Trump-Pence regime” this weekend.\n\nSecond, a video posted on a Facebook page called Vets Before Illegals went viral. The video, entitled “Antifa sets a date for civil war”, claimed that “on their website, they are calling for an open civil war that will start in November”, and set out alleged plans for attacking police officers, then citizens and the government.\n\nLast, but by no means least, the rumor was picked up and amplified by Alex Jones, the radio star with an audience of millions. As Sunshine explains, Jones “is a kind of meta-conspiracy theorist now” who “harvests other people’s theories” and repackages them to fit his narratives and his audience.\n\nOnce Jones had mentioned it, Sunshine explains, the rumor mill exploded: “Once Jones says something, even more people pick up on it and put their own spin on it.” Jones’s website was still running the story on Wednesday morning.\n\nAn absurd turn\n\nIn recent days, the story took an absurd turn, and had its closest brush with more mainstream conservative media, when Gateway Pundit, a longtime conservative blog that has recently expanded into news coverage, published a story by its White House correspondent, Lucian Wintrich, claiming that an “antifa leader” had promised to “behead white parents” on 4 November.\n\nThe tweet the story was based on, however, was a joke from an account that had no apparent ties to any antifa groups.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Wintrich conceded that the tweet his reporting was based on was not serious, and that it was unlikely that there would be a revolution on Saturday. But he did not back away from the story, presenting it as a critique of leftist rhetoric.\n\n“The radical left is always making jokes about killing white people. What would happen if I made a joke about killing all black parents? That would be a national headline.\n\n“If it’s appropriate for them to demonize [conservatives] over quite innocent jokes, why would we just roll over when they make inappropriate jokes? What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.”\n\nThe piece included a detailed account of antifa ideology, which included the claim that the activists “are larpers (‘live action role-play’) attempting to find someone/thing to sexually interact with”.\n\nWhen asked what sources he drew on in reporting on their ideology, Wintrich said: “I did go to school at Bard College. I received my education around people who I’m sure are on terrorist watchlists as socialist or communist extremists.”\n\nAs Sunshine says, Refuse Fascism activists have been supportive of antifa groups in the past, and often show up to the same demonstrations, but there is “no formal connection” between them and antifa. They are also small, he says, and their protest is explicitly nonviolent and specifically directed against the administration, not rightwing activists or police.\n\nMark Bray, historian and author of Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, agrees. “Prior to 2017, the far right didn’t really know what antifa was,” he says, adding that the focus on these groups has a number of causes. It is an extension of the demonization of anarchists in general, but it is also a way to smear mainstream liberals who have no links to antifascist groups.\n\nAnd to some extent, this particular panic has succeeded in energizing a particular slice of the right. As Sunshine puts it: “It motivates the base, it’s part of the apocalyptic narrative they use – there’s always a dangerous event just over the horizon.” Also, he says: “It’s a call for vigilante activity. There are currently tons of threats against leftwing activists.”\n\nAnd unless there is a confrontation as a result of rightwing counter-protesters turning out to shut down the “revolution”, it’s all likely to come to nothing.\n\n“There is no revolution or civil war planned for 4 November,” says Bray. “You can quote me on that.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/01/far-right-conspiracy-theory-us-civil-war","1509508800.0"
"'Beginning Of A New Approach': President Trump Declares Jerusalem Israel's Capital\n'Beginning Of A New Approach': President Trump Declares Jerusalem Israel's Capital\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 2:55 p.m. ET\n\n'I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,' President Trump said in a controversial address from the White House on Wednesday afternoon. He also directed the State Department to 'begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.'\n\nTrump's announcement fulfills a campaign promise but threatens to unsettle volatile politics in the region. It's a dramatic shift from decades of American foreign policy that called for the status of the city, which is claimed as a capital city by both Israelis and Palestinians, to be decided in peace talks. The declaration also breaks with long-standing international practices; no nation has an embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nTrump said previous U.S. presidents have 'failed to deliver' on pledges to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 'I am delivering,' he said in a speech that began shortly after 1 p.m.\n\n'Today we finally acknowledge the obvious,' he said. 'This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality.'\n\nThe president says his announcement does not mean the U.S. is taking a position on any possible future peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians or on the 'final status' of Jerusalem after such talks.\n\nTrump later signed an official proclamation to recognize Jerusalem. That proclamation also stated that the president 'is prepared to support a two-state solution to the dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians' and that the specific boundaries of Israel are subject to negotiation between the two parties.\n\nFor decades, world powers — including the U.S. — have refrained from taking sides in that dispute by locating their embassies in Tel Aviv and avoiding any reference to Jerusalem as a part of Israel.\n\nIn 1995, Congress passed a law calling for the U.S. to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and for the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem. But every president since then has chosen to waive that law, putting off implementation six months at a time. Trump was expected to extend that waiver, while also initiating plans to move the embassy eventually.\n\nAs The Two-Way reported yesterday:\n\n'Moving the embassy was one of Trump's campaign promises as he appealed to pro-Israel voters, including many American evangelicals. 'The White House insists the Jerusalem policy change does not lessen the chances for reaching peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Officials said regional leaders contacted before the decision were committed to encouraging a peaceful solution. But the administration also took precautions. 'The State Department issued warnings to diplomats in the region that protests could break out in the region following a change in policy on Jerusalem.'\n\nBefore the announcement was formally released, several key leaders in the Arab world warned that it would be a dangerous move that would threaten peace talks, as NPR's Scott Neuman wrote this morning.\n\n'There will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,' Trump said Wednesday. 'But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation.'\n\n'The United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides,' Trump said. 'I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement.'\n\nThe divided city of Jerusalem has a long and bloody history of conflict, NPR's Greg Myre and Mark Katkov write:\n\n'Deadly riots targeting Jewish communities erupted in 1929 over the city's most contentious holy site, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims. Recognizing the religious sensitivities, the United Nations proposed a partition plan in 1947 that created two separate states but called for Jerusalem to be under international control. 'The plan was approved, but fighting following Israel's declaration of independence left the city divided. Jordan occupied the east; Israel the west. It remained this way until the 1967 war, when Israel captured the eastern part of the city as well and claimed all of it as its capital. Amid peace negotiations in 2000, Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli opposition leader, visited the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary. Palestinians rioted the next day and it turned into a five-year uprising, the Second Intifada. ... 'Palestinian Arabs make up nearly 40 percent of Jerusalem's population and live almost exclusively in the east. ... 'Following Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967, the city's borders were redrawn, tripling its size. Some 200,000 Jewish Israelis have moved to the eastern side of the city and a small number of Jewish nationalists have established residence within traditionally Arab neighborhoods. 'Arab residents of East Jerusalem typically do not participate in municipal elections, so as not to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the city. The two communities have little social interaction.'\n\nThe status of Jerusalem, a city containing sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, is 'probably the most combustible issue in the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict,' as we wrote yesterday.\n\nCritics from around the globe have denounced Trump's proclamation as detrimental to the peace process, though Trump emphasized in his statement that the decision 'is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement.'\n\nAfter Trump's speech, a prominent Palestinian exiled politician, Mohammed Dahlan, said on Twitter that the decision is a 'historic mistake' that breaches 'the principle of inviolability of the status of Jerusalem.' He called for an end to cooperation with the U.S.\n\nSome Jewish groups in the U.S. celebrated the move, while others denounced the timing as premature and likely to create fresh conflict.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the president for the 'historic decision,' saying his nation 'will be forever grateful.'\n\n'So far, not a single country other than Israel has thrown its support behind the declaration,' The Associated Press notes.\n\nIt's not just nations standing in opposition. Christian leaders in Jerusalem warned Trump that a change of policy in Jerusalem 'would cause irreparable harm.' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called this a 'moment of great anxiety' and emphasized that 'there is no alternative to the two-state solution.'\n\nAnd Pope Francis, in an address delivered before Trump's speech, expressed 'deep worry' over the upcoming U.S. policy change, according to a Reuters translation.\n\nHe made a 'heartfelt appeal' for everyone to respect the status quo in Jerusalem and prayed that 'wisdom and prudence prevail, in order to avoid adding new elements of tension to a global panorama that is already convulsed and marked by so many and cruel conflicts.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/06/568838360/watch-president-trump-to-speak-on-jerusalem","1512536400.0"
"Terror Alert in Britain Is Raised to Maximum as ISIS Claims Manchester Attack\nMANCHESTER, England — Britain’s prime minister put the nation on its highest level of alert on Tuesday and deployed the military to work with the police over fears that another terrorist attack was imminent.\n\nThe announcement came as the police continued to investigate whether the Monday night bombing at a pop music concert in Manchester that killed 22 people, including children, was part of a broader conspiracy.\n\nPhoto\n\n“It is a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack,” Prime Minister Theresa May said in Manchester after a meeting of her top security officials.\n\nEarlier in the day, the police raided the home of Salman Abedi, the man they identified as the bomber; he died in the blast. Chief Constable Ian Hopkins of the Greater Manchester Police said that the investigation was focusing on determining “whether Mr. Abedi was acting alone or as part of a network.”\n\nA senior United States official said on Tuesday night that Mr. Abedi had traveled multiple times to Libya, where his parents immigrated from, but did not know the timing of his last trip. The official was not authorized to discuss the information publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBy raising the national threat level from severe to critical, Ms. May suggested “not only that an attack remains highly likely, but that a further attack may be imminent.”\n\nThe government’s actions on Tuesday night came hours after the authorities began the gruesome task of identifying the dead. An 8-year-old girl who had attended the Ariana Grande concert with her mother and older sister and a college student who chronicled on Instagram her encounters with her pop-music idols like Ms. Grande were among those killed.\n\nAs the authorities bolstered the nation’s defenses, investigators set out to learn as much as they could about Mr. Abedi, 22, who lived with his family only a few miles from where he detonated a homemade bomb on a public concourse crowded with Ms. Grande’s adoring teenage fans leaving the arena.\n\nRaids and Arrests\n\nRescue workers sifting through the carnage outside the arena on Monday night discovered Mr. Abedi’s identification card. That clue led the police to the home he shared with his family on Elsmore Road, in the Fallowfield district. The police blew the house’s door off its frame, to safeguard against booby traps, as shocked neighbors watched.\n\n“We’ve been watching this kind of attack happen in Paris,” said a neighbor, Thomas Coull, 17. “We didn’t expect it to happen on our doorstep, literally.”\n\nMr. Abedi was born in 1994 in Britain, according to a law enforcement official speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was still underway.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in one post on social media that “one of the soldiers of the caliphate was able to place an explosive device within a gathering of the crusaders in the city of Manchester.” It was one of several Islamic State statements, some contradictory, posted on different social media accounts.\n\nA neighbor of the Abedi family in the Fallowfield district, southwest of the Manchester city center, said the family “didn’t really speak to anyone.” The neighbor, Lina Ahmed, added, “They were nice people if you walked past.” She said the family occasionally displayed a Libyan flag outside the home.\n\nAnother neighbor, Farzana Kosur, said that the mother, who taught the Quran, had been abroad for about two months. A trustee of the Manchester Islamic Center said Mr. Abedi’s father and his brother Ismael attended the mosque, but the trustee, Fawzi Haffar, did not know if Mr. Abedi worshiped there.\n\nVideo\n\nA senior member of the Muslim community in Manchester and a law enforcement official who requested anonymity said Mr. Abedi had been barred from the mosque in 2015 for expressing his support for the Islamic State, and he came to the attention of intelligence agencies at the time as “a person of interest.”\n\nIn raising the threat level, Mrs. May cited information gathered Tuesday in the investigation into the Manchester bombing and said the Joint Terrorism Analysis Center, the body responsible for setting the level, would continue to review the situation.\n\n“The change in the threat level means that there will be additional resources and support made available to the police as they work to keep us all safe,” Mrs. May said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The second was on June 30, 2007, after two men slammed an S.U.V. into entrance doors at Glasgow Airport and turned the vehicle into a potentially lethal fireball.\n\nAfter the prime minister’s announcement, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the head of National Counter Terrorism Policing, said in a statement that “we are flexing our resources to increase police presence at key sites, such as transport and other crowded places, and we are reviewing key events over the coming weeks.”\n\nPhoto\n\n“I have asked for support from the military to be deployed alongside the police,” Commissioner Rowley added. “This will free up armed officers from certain guarding duties to release our officers to support the wider response.”\n\nAs part of their investigation into the Manchester bombing, the police arrested a 23-year-old man outside a supermarket near Mr. Abedi’s home, but it was not immediately clear if that man was connected in some way to the attack.\n\nThe terrorist attack was the worst in the history of Manchester, a city of a half-million people, and the worst in Britain since July 7, 2005, when 52 people died, along with four assailants, in coordinated attacks on London’s transit system.\n\nPhoto\n\nSecurity experts suggested that the use of an improvised explosive device in Manchester displayed a level of sophistication that implied collaborators — and the possibility that other bombs had been made at the same time.\n\nChris Phillips, a former leader of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office in Britain, told the BBC: “It has involved a lot of planning — it’s a bit of a step up. This is a much more professional-style attack.”\n\nThe Islamic State also claimed responsibility for the March 22 attack near Parliament in which a British man fatally struck four pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before killing a police officer. British authorities say they have also broken up terrorist cells operating in the country.\n\nBut investigators fear the Manchester attack indicates a higher level of sophistication, requiring more planning and the possibility of more attacks, prompting the national threat level to be raised.\n\nThe bombing came in the final stretch of campaigning before a general election on June 8 in Britain, and the country’s political parties agreed on Tuesday to suspend campaigning. Opposition politicians — Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party, Tim Farron of the Liberal Democrats and Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party — joined Mrs. May in expressing their grief and condolences.\n\nIt was unclear what effect the attack might have on the election. Some political experts suggested it would help Mrs. May, who, in her previous role as home secretary, was in charge of Britain’s domestic security and is generally perceived as a tough leader. But difficult questions are already being asked about what security gaps might have abetted the assault, and what could have been done to prevent it.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/world/europe/manchester-arena-attack-ariana-grande.html","1495512000.0"
"Imagery shows latest North Korean missile larger, more powerful, analysts say\nSince July's launch of the Hwasong-14, its first long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), North Korea analysts have been looking for signs the isolated country has developed precise guidance systems, reliable and powerful rocket engines, and a re-entry vehicle capable of protecting a nuclear warhead as it speeds toward its target.\n\n'North Korea is continuing to pursue its ICBM in a methodical and pragmatic manner, making progress in incremental steps,' said Joseph Bermudez from 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project.\n\nU.S. officials noted, however, that North Korea has not proved it has an accurate guidance system for an ICBM or a capable re-entry vehicle.\n\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon cautioned that more analysis is needed to determine the Hwasong-15's full performance, but said North Korea had clearly made significant changes since the Hwasong-14.\n\nThe newly developed intercontinental ballistic rocket Hwasong-15 in Pyongyang KCNA / Reuters\n\n'Our initial analysis of the photos showed that there were clear differences between the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-14 in terms of the looks of the warhead, the joint of the first and second stages of the missile, and overall size,' Roh told a briefing on Thursday.\n\nNorth Korea said the new missile soared to an altitude of about 2,780 miles, more than 10 times the height of the International Space Station, and flew 590 miles during its 53-minute flight — higher and longer than any North Korean missile, before landing in the sea near Japan.\n\nLarger, more powerful\n\nThe missile's large size was immediately apparent in the photos, which analysts said could provide for a more powerful propulsion system.\n\n'This is a very big missile,' Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said in an analysis posted to Twitter.

Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club.'\n\nOne U.S. intelligence official told Reuters the Hwasong-15 test appears to demonstrate a more powerful North Korean solid-fuel propulsion system, especially in its second-stage rocket.\n\nRelated: At United Nations, Ambassador Haley warns North Korea against war\n\nA solid-fuel system for an ICBM would be a significant development and could allow the North Koreans to transport and launch a missile more quickly, compared to a liquid-fuel system that requires lengthy preparation.\n\nThe photos appeared to show the missile with at least two large nozzles on its first stage, instead of the one large and several smaller nozzles on the Hwasong-14.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/imagery-shows-latest-north-korean-missile-larger-more-powerful-analysts-n825176","None"
"Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight; here's how to watch\nIf it's clear outside on Wednesday night (Dec. 13) and Thursday morning (Dec. 14) before dawn, be sure to go outdoors. One of the year's top meteor showers, the Geminids, will peak, with rates as high as one or two meteors per minute at around 10 p.m. local time. However, the show will start around 7 p.m. local time, according to the magazine Sky & Telescope.\n\nBut if you can't make it out, or if skies are gloomy, you can also watch a Geminids webcast here on Space.com courtesy of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama starting about 6 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on Dec. 13. The Virtual Telescope Project will also host a webcast here showing live views from Italy, starting at 5 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT) on Dec. 13, and Arizona, starting at 5 a.m. (1000 GMT) on Dec. 14.\n\n'The Geminids are usually one of the two best meteor showers of the year,' Alan MacRobert, senior editor at Sky & Telescope, said in a statement. 'Sometimes, they're more impressive than the better-known Perseids of August.' [Geminid Meteor Shower 2017: When, Where & How to See It Next]\n\nGregg Dinderman/Sky & Telescope\n\nThe meteors will appear to radiate from the constellation Gemini, which is in between the constellations Taurus and Cancer. To find Gemini, look for the bright constellation Orion (easily visible due to the 'belt' of three stars in a row). Gemini is just over Orion's right shoulder. But there's no need to look directly at Gemini to see the meteors.\n\n'Don't fixate on looking toward Gemini,' Kelly Beatty, a senior editor at Sky & Telescope, said in the statement. 'Geminids can appear anywhere in the sky, so the best direction to watch is wherever your sky is darkest, which is probably straight up.'\n\nYou just need some warm clothing and your eyes to see a meteor shower in person. But if you have a small telescope and are watching in the Northern Hemisphere, you will get an extra treat. The source for the Geminids, the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, is coincidentally making its closest approach to Earth this week and so has 11th-magnitude visibility. (Lower magnitudes are brighter. By comparison, the faintest stars you can see with the naked eye are around magnitude 6, and the planet Venus is minus 5.) To find Phaethon, you can use this sky chart on Space.com.\n\nSky & Telescope\n\nYou can also spot the object virtually in the next few days: The Virtual Telescope will host a webcast with live views from Arizona starting at 3 a.m. EST (0800 GMT) on Dec. 15 and Italy starting Dec. 16 at 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT).\n\nThe Geminids have been known as an annual meteor shower since 1862, but Phaethon wasn't discovered until 1983. It's about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) across and orbits the sun every 1.4 years. Phaethon sheds material when it gets close to the sun, and its surface is heated to about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit (700 Celsius.)\n\nMeteor showers like the Geminids occur when the Earth plows into a stream of debris in space left behind by a comet or asteroid. The debris stream's location in space can alter from year to year depending on the influence of Jupiter's gravity, among other factors, which contributes to the intensity of the shower.\n\nThe light of the moon can wash out fainter meteors. However, this year, the moon is just a waning crescent and will not rise until early in the morning, after 3 a.m. To best see the meteors, find an area as far away as possible from artificial lights and give your eyes about 20 minutes to adjust to the darkness. Also make sure to dress warmly.\n\n'Go out late in the evening, lie back in a reclining lawn chair, and gaze up into the stars,' MacRobert said. 'Be patient.'\n\nEditor's note: If you capture a great shot of a Geminid meteor or any other night-sky view that you would like to share with Space.com for a possible story or gallery, send images and comments in to: spacephotos@space.com.\n\nFollow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

"Immigrants' impact on the U.S. economy in 7 charts\nThe furor over U.S. immigration tends to gloss over one thing: the impact of immigrants on the U.S. economy. About 25 million immigrants are working in the country today, filling jobs from programming to construction. (That figure includes legal immigrants, temporary residents, refugees and undocumented immigrants, but the data does not distinguish between people in different categories.)\n\nAs public debate flares over the conditions for entering the U.S., immigrants remain a major part of the world’s largest economy. Here’s how immigrants living in America today compare with native-born people as gauged by their likelihood of holding a job, earnings and other measures.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova\n\n1. Immigrants participate in the U.S. labor force at a slightly higher rate than native-born Americans\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development calculated the labor force participation rate -- the percentage of working-age adults who are employed or looking for a job -- by counting the number of people in each group (native-born or immigrant) who were either working or looking for a job, relative to the size of that group in the country.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova\n\n2. U.S. immigrants earn consistently less than native-born workers\n\nImmigrants’ income gap with people born in the U.S. holds true for both women and men across all age groups. Young immigrants make nearly equal pay to their native-born counterparts, but the gap increases as workers age.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova\n\n3. More-educated immigrants earn more than their native-born counterparts\n\nImmigrants with a college degree or higher earn slightly more than native-born workers in the same category -- about 2.8 percent more, according to recent U.S. Labor Department data.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova\n\n4. Immigrants are more likely to own businesses than native-born Americans\n\nAn analysis from the Small Business Administration found that 10.5 percent of U.S. immigrants own a business, compared with 9.3 percent of native-born Americans. In other words, an individual immigrant is about 10 percent more likely to own a business than a nonimmigrant.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova\n\n5. Immigrants start businesses at higher rates\n\nFor every 10,000 immigrants to the U.S., about 62 will start a business -- more than double the rate for the native-born.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova\n\n6. Immigrant business founders have grown more important to the economy over time\n\nImmigrants were involved in founding one-quarter of the companies that went public between 1990 and 2005. Their importance has grown since then: One-third of the companies that went public between 2006 and 2012 had at least one immigrant founder. Of the 87 privately held companies currently valued at over $1 billion, 51 percent had immigrant founders.\n\nCBS MoneyWatch/Irina Ivanova\n\n7. Immigrants tend to cluster in certain occupations\n\nCompared with people born in the U.S., immigrants are more likely to work in buildings and grounds maintenance, construction, computer, math or science occupations, and jobs in food preparation or service. Native-born workers are more likely to be employed in sales, business and financial operations, office support or social service jobs.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigrants-impact-on-the-u-s-economy-in-7-charts/","None"

"Awaiting Trump's coal comeback, miners reject retraining\nWAYNESBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - When Mike Sylvester entered a career training center earlier this year in southwestern Pennsylvania, he found more than one hundred federally funded courses covering everything from computer programming to nursing.\n\nHe settled instead on something familiar: a coal mining course.\n\n“I think there is a coal comeback,” said the 33-year-old son of a miner.\n\nDespite broad consensus about coal’s bleak future, a years-long effort to diversify the economy of this hard-hit region away from mining is stumbling, with Obama-era jobs retraining classes undersubscribed and future programs at risk under President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget.\n\nTrump has promised to revive coal by rolling back environmental regulations and moved to repeal Obama-era curbs on carbon emissions from power plants.\n\n“I have a lot of faith in President Trump,” Sylvester said.\n\nBut hundreds of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years, and cheap natural gas continues to erode domestic demand. The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n\nAlthough there have been small gains in coal output and hiring this year, driven by foreign demand, production levels remain near lows hit in 1978.\n\nA White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers.\n\nWhat many experts call false hopes for a coal resurgence have mired economic development efforts here in a catch-22: Coal miners are resisting retraining without ready jobs from new industries, but new companies are unlikely to move here without a trained workforce. The stalled diversification push leaves some of the nation’s poorest areas with no clear path to prosperity.\n\nFederal retraining programs have fared better, with some approaching full participation, in the parts of Appalachia where mining has been crushed in a way that leaves little hope for a comeback, according to county officials and recruiters. They include West Virginia and Kentucky, where coal resources have been depleted.\n\nBut in southern Pennsylvania, where the industry still has ample reserves and is showing flickers of life, federal jobs retraining programs see sign-up rates below 20 percent, the officials and recruiters said. In southern Virginia’s coal country, participation rates run about 50 percent, they said.\n\n“Part of our problem is we still have coal,” said Robbie Matesic, executive director of Greene County’s economic development department.\n\nOut-of-work miners cite many reasons beyond faith in Trump policy for their reluctance to train for new industries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen former and prospective coal workers, career counselors and local economic development officials. They say mining pays well; other industries are unfamiliar; and there’s no income during training and no guarantee of a job afterward.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Corsa Coal opened a mine in Somerset in June which will create about 70 jobs – one of the first mines to open here in years. And Consol Energy recently expanded its Bailey mine complex in Greene County.\n\nBut Consol also announced in January that it plans to sell its coal holdings to focus on natural gas. And it has commissioned a recruitment agency, GMS Mines and Repair, to find contract laborers for its coal expansion who will be paid about $13 an hour - half the hourly wage of a starting unionized coal worker. The program Sylvester signed up for was set up by GMS.\n\nThe new hiring in Pennsylvania is related mainly to an uptick in foreign demand for metallurgical coal, used in producing steel, rather than domestic demand for thermal coal from power plants, the industry’s main business. Some market analysts describe the foreign demand as a temporary blip driven by production problems in the coal hub of Australia.\n\nOfficials for U.S. coal companies operating in the region, including Consol and Corsa, declined requests for comment.\n\n“The coal industry has stabilized, but it’s not going to come back,” said Blair Zimmerman, a 40-year veteran of the mines who is now the commissioner for Greene County, one of Pennsylvania’s oldest coal regions. “We need to look at the future.”\n\nStudents sit in a training class at the Pennsylvania Career Link office located in Waynesburg. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk\n\nEMPTY SEATS\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Labor has received about $2 million since 2015 from the federal POWER program, an initiative of former President Barack Obama to help retrain workers in coal-dependent areas. But the state is having trouble putting even that modest amount of money to good use.\n\nIn Greene and Washington counties, 120 people have signed up for jobs retraining outside the mines, far short of the target of 700, said Ami Gatts, director of the Washington-Greene County Job Training Agency. In Westmoreland and Fayette counties, participation in federal job retraining programs has been about 15 percent of capacity, officials said.\n\n“I can’t even get them to show up for free food I set up in the office,” said Dave Serock, an ex-miner who recruits in Fayette County for Southwest Training Services.\n\nPrograms administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal and state partnership to strengthen the region’s economy, have had similar struggles. One $1.4 million ARC project to teach laid-off miners in Greene County and in West Virginia computer coding has signed up only 20 people for 95 slots. Not a single worker has enrolled in another program launched this summer to prepare ex-miners to work in the natural gas sector, officials said.\n\nGreene County Commissioner Zimmerman said he’d like to see a big company like Amazon or Toyota come to southwestern Pennsylvania to build a distribution or manufacturing plant that could employ thousands.\n\nBut he knows first the region needs a ready workforce.\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson said the company the company typically works with local organizations to evaluate whether locations have an appropriate workforce and has no current plans for distribution operations in Western Pennsylvania. Toyota spokesman Edward Lewis said the company considers local workforce training an “important consideration” when deciding where to locate facilities.\n\nSIGNS OF LIFE\n\nSean Moodie and his brother Steve spent the last two years working in the natural gas industry, but see coal as a good bet in the current political climate.\n\n“I am optimistic that you can make a good career out of coal for the next 50 years,” said Sean Moodie.\n\nCoal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel. Like Sylvester, the Moodie brothers are taking mining courses offered by Consol’s recruiter, GMS.\n\nBob Levo, who runs a GMS training program, offered a measure of realism: The point of the training is to provide low-cost and potentially short-term labor to a struggling industry, he said.\n\n“That’s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,” he said. “They rely on us to provide labor at lower cost.”\n\nClemmy Allen, 63, a veteran miner and head of the United Mineworkers of America’s Career Centers, said miners are taking a big risk in holding out for a coal recovery.\n\nHe’s placing his hopes for the region’s future on retraining. UMWA’s 64-acre campus in Prosperity, Pennsylvania - which once trained coal miners - will use nearly $3 million in federal and state grants to retrofit classrooms to teach cybersecurity, truck driving and mechanical engineering.\n\n“Unlike when I worked in the mines,” he said, “if you get laid off now, you are pretty much laid off.”\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nFollow Trump’s impact on energy, environment, healthcare, immigration and the economy at The Trump Effect - www.reuters.com/trump-effect\n\n(Refiles to remove repeated words “the company” in paragraph 26)","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-coal-retraining-insight/awaiting-trumps-coal-comeback-miners-reject-retraining-idUSKBN1D14G0","1509573342.0"

The latest birthday card: this elegant swirl of galaxies dancing in tandem deep in space. Last year -- this bubble of stellar gases floating among the stars, like a diaphanous, cosmic jellyfish. Hubble has shown us radiant rose-shaped galaxies stretching across deep space; and dramatic towering clouds of gas teeming with the stuff of creation. Stars are born here. Year after year, in the infinite black canvas overhead, Hubble paints an ever-expanding picture of our universe -- an awe-inspiring light show for us to admire ... and for scientists to study.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: I believe Hubble has been the single most transformative scientific instrument that we've ever built.\n\n'Most transformative,' says NASA astrophysicist Amber Straughn, because Hubble keeps improving our understanding of the universe. She showed us what Hubble discovered after staring for days into what seemed to be an empty black patch -- a deep, dark void -- in outer space.\n\nCBS News\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: The original Hubble deep field is located just above the Big Dipper. It's a part of the sky that most people are familiar with. It's a blank piece of sky.\n\n'I believe Hubble has been the single most transformative scientific instrument that we've ever built.'\n\nBILL WHITAKER: So just nothing in here, just darkness.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Nothing at all. Complete darkness. And then, when we look at it with Hubble, what we see is thousands of galaxies.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Not just stars.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Right.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Galaxies.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Galaxies outside of our own. Something we never imagined.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Is it that Hubble just stares into that dark spot until the light penetrates and reveals itself?\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: That's exactly what happens. It's sometimes many, many, many days of just staring at one part of the sky and allowing the photons to collect on your detector.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: And this is what's revealed.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: And this is what's revealed.\n\nBut Hubble was just warming up. That was 22 years ago. Since then Hubble has stared deeper and longer into space with enhanced equipment.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: In this particular image, there are 10,000 galaxies. So every single point of light is an individual galaxy, its own little island universe. And so this is a real visualization of the distances of these galaxies. So sort of like—\n\nNASA\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Sort of 3D.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: --3D, like we're flying though. So we can make these images 3D because we know how far away the galaxies are. What Hubble has essentially given us is the size of the universe. Hubble has taught us that the universe is filled with hundreds of billions of other galaxies.\n\nAnd now the latest analysis of Hubble's data reveals there could be more than two trillion galaxies—10 times more than previously thought. Typical galaxies, like our Milky Way, have 100 billion stars. That means the total number of stars—or suns out there—is 2, followed by 23 zeros. That's called 200 sextillion. To get some sense of how many stars that is, we went to Adam Riess, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on Hubble.\n\nADAM RIESS: This is more stars in the visible universe than grains of sand on the beach.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: --on Earth.\n\nADAM RIESS: On all the beaches on Earth.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: And Hubble has shown us this?\n\nNASA\n\nADAM RIESS: It has. In many cases, it has allowed us to see what some of the most distant galaxies look like and how many stars were in them. And we've been able to add it all up.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Hubble has been called a time machine -- that it looks back in time. What has been the most astounding part of that for you?\n\nADAM RIESS: I study explosions of stars called supernovae. It's like fireworks. It's only visible for a short period of time, in this case, a few weeks. And that light has been traveling to us for 10 billion years. It began its journey when the Earth wasn't even here, And over those 10 billion years, our planet formed. Life developed. We built the Hubble Space Telescope. We opened the aperture door. And in the last one-billionth of one percent of that journey that the light made, we opened the door just in time to catch it.\n\nHubble almost didn't catch anything. The first pictures it sent back were blurry because of a microscopic flaw in the mirror. The Space Agency launched a daring mission to fix it.\n\nNASA\n\nAstronauts have made five trips to Hubble to repair and upgrade its equipment. John Grunsfeld, known as the Hubble repairman, flew three of those missions, to a telescope the size of a school bus, orbiting 300 miles above Earth.\n\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Just about anything that we can easily change and upgrade and fix has been fixed.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: The workings of the telescope, all of that has been transformed.\n\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: Yeah. It is like a new telescope.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: On your last mission you come out of the airlock and you've got this big smile on your face.\n\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I thought, You know, I can't imagine anywhere I'd rather be than outside the space shuttle in my space suit next to the Hubble Space Telescope. I was just so happy.\n\nHubble has changed what we know about the universe—its structure, evolution, it's age—13.8 billion years. Hubble showed us the marvel and majesty of stars being born.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: This is a region of gas and dust that's churning up new baby stars. And now we've learned with Hubble, not only stars but also baby planet systems.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Most of these stars have planets going around them?\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Most stars actually do have planets. When I was a kid, we only knew of the planets inside our solar system. And now we know that the planets are absolutely everywhere.\n\nAstronomer Heidi Hammel specializes in Hubble's work within our solar system. With the telescope she saw huge fragments of a comet slam into Jupiter creating giant impacts.\n\nHEIDI HAMMEL: When I first heard that a comet was going to hit Jupiter, my reaction was, 'Eh. So what? Jupiter's huge. Comets are small. And so when I saw the first impact site and it was huge and dark, I was flabbergasted. This is where the comet has smacked into the planet at such a high velocity that it's caused an explosion the equivalent of many, many millions of atomic bombs.\n\nHEIDI HAMMEL: The Earth is the size of that ring. And so if this event, had happened on Earth it—\n\nBILL WHITAKER: We're gone.\n\nHEIDI HAMMEL: Yeah, We we call that a biosphere-changing event, which basically means we'd be gone.\n\nHubble orbits high, outside Earth's atmosphere so it can see a wide spectrum of light our atmosphere blocks. Beyond Earth's protective layer, Hubble's ultraviolet camera can spot dazzling displays like this glowing halo on top of Jupiter.\n\nHEIDI HAMMEL: Up in the northern hemisphere what you're seeing is the glowing aurorae. An aurora happens when the planet's magnetic field has charged particles that interact with the upper atmosphere. What you're seeing there is actually charged particles from the sun. They get swept up in Jupiter's strong magnetic field. And then it's mirrored in that shimmering that you see inside the aurora oval.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: And you would not be able to see that with an Earth telescope?\n\nHEIDI HAMMEL: You could never see those aurorae because our atmosphere has an ozone layer that absorbs the ultraviolet light.\n\nHubble also found a similar blue hue at the bottom of Saturn. The telescope's most iconic picture is this: the pillars of creation, a stellar breeding place. Amber Straughn showed us what a difference Hubble's upgraded infrared camera made, just two years ago.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Stars are born inside these dust clouds. And this is gonna give you a clue on why infrared is so important is because in infrared light, what you see is the stars inside shining through.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: You see the stars inside. How big is this cloud area?\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Top to bottom, these pillars are about ten light years, which is about 60 trillion miles.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: 60 trillion miles?\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Yes. Space is big.\n\n'Big' and miraculous with constant celestial regeneration. Straughn calls this 'the everything picture' because you can see old stars blowing up -- and new stars forming.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Any time you see these sorts of dark cloudy regions, you can imagine that there's stars being born inside there.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Where are the dying stars?\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: And the dying stars, we think that this one could explode any day, literally, or it could be a thousand years from now. But near near term in astronomers' --\n\nBILL WHITAKER: In cosmic time, any day.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: Right. So big stars, when they die, they explode and send their contents into the surrounding universe. And these contents are what seed future stars and future planets and help to seed life, ultimately. The iron in your blood and the calcium in your bones was literally forged inside of a star that ended its life like this.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: So we are all stardust.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: We literally are stardust. We are viscerally made of the stars. One of the things I think is remarkable about this image is it shows you how colorful the universe is.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: This looks like contemporary art.\n\nAMBER STRAUGHN: This is a very tightly bound group of stars. And what you see here is about 100,000 stars. This was one of the first images that Hubble's new camera, installed in 2009, this was one of the first images it took.\n\nBlue stars are the youngest and hottest. White and yellow stars, like our sun, are mid-life; while red stars are the oldest and coolest. John Grunsfeld has a cool claim to fame. He's the last human to touch Hubble. He gave it a farewell pat.\n\nBILL WHITAKER: Hubble was planned to live for 15 years. It's now been 27. How much longer can Hubble go?\n\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: I'm reasonably confident it will continue another three to five years.\n\nThat means for a while at least, Hubble will work in tandem with its successor, the much larger James Webb telescope scheduled to launch in 2019. Webb should be able to detect light from the very earliest galaxies. The farthest back Hubble can see is this red blob, a galaxy from 400-milion years after the Big Bang. Webb should take us much closer to the beginning of time.\n\nJOHN GRUNSFELD: So the James Webb Space Telescope was specifically designed to see the first stars and galaxies that were formed in the universe. So we're gonna see the snapshot of when stars started. When galaxies started. The very first moments of the universe. And my bet? There's gonna be some big surprises.\n\nProduced by Robert G.

"Nearly 700 Miles of Fencing at the US-Mexico Border Already Exist\nPresident Donald Trump's longtime campaign promise of building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border could be one step closer to fruition after he signed an executive order Wednesday announcing a series of steps to deter 'illegal immigration from Central America.'\n\nInterested in Mexico? Add Mexico as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Mexico news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nBut some 700 miles of border fencing had already been completed along the country's nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico, much of it during Barack Obama's presidency, as part of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed by George W. Bush.\n\nThe type of fencing that extends from California to Texas varies according to the terrain and the population of the areas it borders, according to images released by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2011. The types of fencing includes wire mesh, chain link, post and rail, sheet piling, concrete barriers for vehicles and X-shaped steel beams for livestock.\n\nJose Luis Gonzalez/REUTERS\n\nTrump has said he wants a concrete barrier as high as 55 feet tall and has described his proposed wall as 'impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful.'\n\nUnder the Secure Fence Act, the pedestrian border fencing completed in fiscal year 2007 was estimated to cost about $2.8 million per mile, according to a 2009 report from the Government Accountability Office. It was constructed using mostly the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard, according to the Congressional Research Service. The 2009 report also found that fencing constructed in fiscal year 2008, which mostly used private contractors, cost about $3.9 million per mile.\n\n“Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders, gets back its borders,” Trump said Wednesday at the Department of Homeland Security after signing two executive orders related to immigration. The executive order calls for the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border to achieve 'operational control,' which it defines as 'the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.”\n\nBuilding a new 1,000-mile wall could cost as much as $40 billion, according to an analysis published in the MIT Technology Review. Maintenance of barriers along the southern border will also be costly. The Congressional Research Service estimated in 2009 that double layer fencing would cost an estimated $16.4 million to $70 million per mile over 25 years, depending on the amount of damage sustained.\n\nDuring Wednesday's press conference, Trump did not specify how he plans to pay for the wall, but in the executive order he asks to allocate available sources of federal funding to the 'planing, designing, and constructing of a physical wall' as well as to project long-term funding requirements from the Congressional Budget Office. He also calls for each executive department and agency to identify and report all foreign aid to Mexico.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump said that Mexico will reimburse the U.S for the cost of building the wall. Mexican officials have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.\n\nThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017\n\nOn Wednesday, the new president said that he has 'deep admiration for the people of Mexico,' adding that he looks forward to meeting with Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto and that he 'truly' believes that the U.S. and Mexico can improve relations going forward.\n\nPeña Nieto may cancel a visit with Trump scheduled for next week in response to today's announcement, a Mexican official told ABC News. The Mexican president has been under fire in his country recently for being seen as too accommodating to Trump.\n\nEPA\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing earlier this month, newly-minted DHS Secretary Gen. John Kelly said that 'a physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job.'\n\n'It has to be a layered defense,' he said, adding that even with a wall extending from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, you would still have to back that wall up with patrolling by human beings, sensors and observation devices, he said.\n\nBorder Patrol already employs a 'digital wall' composed of about 8,000 cameras, which monitor the southern fence and ports of entry. Its resources also include more than 11,000 underground senors, 107 aircraft, eight drones, 175 mobile surveillance units and 84 boats.\n\n“We can spend billions of dollars to build a 10-foot wall on top of a 10,000-foot mountain,” former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said in November, “but if you’ve come all the way from Central America, it’s not going to stop you.”\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president predicted Wednesday that his executive orders will 'save thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and billions and billions of dollars.'\n\nABC News' Geneva Sands and Jordyn Phelps contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/700-miles-fencing-us-mexico-border-exist/story?id=45045054","None"
"Goldman attorney ready to collect from O.J. Simpson\nNow that Simpson has been released from a Nevada prison after serving nine years for a robbery and kidnapping conviction, Cook says he's ready to start working again. 'The good news for me is he's getting out. The bad news for him is I'm in good health. I'm good to go.'\n\nCook has been representing the survivors of Ron Goldman for more than a decade. He is working to collect on the multimillion-dollar jury verdict they and the Brown family were awarded after a 1996 civil jury found Simpson responsible for the deaths of Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson, the athlete's former wife.\n\nSimpson was acquitted in 1995 of their murders, but he was ordered to pay $33.5 million after losing the wrongful death suits in 1997. That figure increased twofold, Cook says, because of interest. 'I renewed the judgment in 2015 at $57 million. Two years have passed, so now it's a touch under $70 million.'\n\nCook says collecting any part of that amount has been anything but easy. Specializing in collections for 43 years, the attorney said he is ready for 'round two,' should Simpson earn anything while out of prison. Simpson was released by the Nevada Department of Corrections early Sunday morning.\n\nMalcolm LaVergne, Simpson's attorney, said he is empathetic to the Goldmans over their loss, and agreed they have a right to collect on the award.\n\nBut the Las Vegas lawyer doesn't hold out much hope for the family, telling CNN, 'As far as I know, (Simpson) will be a retiree.'\n\nLaVergne was unhappy with a New York Post article claiming Simpson's youngest children have made major real estate purchases in Florida. Cook told the Post he wanted to know whether their father helped finance the deals.\n\n'I have no problem if the Goldmans want to go out and do their publicity tours and promote their books and do everything. ... They're professional public figure victims at this point,' LaVergne said. But, he said, 'there's a new sheriff in town' to counter the Goldmans' claims about his client.\n\nA Goldman family representative was not available for comment.\n\nSimpson's book has been biggest asset\n\nRon Goldman's father, Fred, and other relatives know they can't lay claim to many of Simpson's assets, such as his NFL pension, as well as any home he has owned or may own. Members of Simpson's inner circle say the plan is for Simpson to eventually move to Florida, where state law, experts say, provides him additional protections. The former athlete moved to Florida after the civil judgment.\n\nFlorida Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote a letter to Florida's Department of Corrections on Friday saying she did not want Simpson to move to her state and asking them to 'notify all appropriate authorities of the State of Nevada that the State of Florida objects to the granting of such permission.'\n\nJUST WATCHED Helicopter pilots recount infamous O.J. chase Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Helicopter pilots recount infamous O.J. chase 03:22\n\nLaVergne lambasted Bondi for the letter, accusing her of exploiting the issue to score political points ahead of elections.\n\nCook applauded the effort: 'Mr. Simpson should pay the judgments due Ron Goldman's grieved parents. Pam Bondi got it right. The parole board got it wrong.'\n\nThe most lucrative asset the Goldmans have been able to grab was the publishing rights to the Simpson book 'If I Did It,' which was termed a hypothetical account of the killings. With publisher HarperCollins pulling out of the book deal at the last minute in 2006, Cook knew it was his chance to claim the asset.\n\n'What I recognized at that moment ...it dawned on me there's a reversionary right. HarperCollins is going to kick back the rights back to Mr. Simpson.'\n\nCook says he beat Simpson, now 70, 'to the punch' and got the rights to the unpublished book for the Goldmans.\n\nThe volume has sold more than 300,000 copies, landing it on The New York Times' best-seller list. Cook did not cite an amount the Goldmans have collected from sales.\n\nAbout the Heisman Trophy\n\nAfter the civil judgment, Simpson's Heisman Trophy was ordered sold to help pay off the award. It brought in $230,000. The Goldmans believe they have a claim to the trophy, but they don't know who has it.\n\nJUST WATCHED O.J. Simpson: Football legend to Nevada prisoner Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH O.J. Simpson: Football legend to Nevada prisoner 01:30\n\nThey almost got the suit that Simpson wore when he was acquitted of murder charges in 1995, Cook said. The apparel was owned by Simpson's former agent, but the family eventually supported a decision to donate it to the Newseum in Washington for display.\n\nThen there is the memorabilia involved in Simpson's Nevada conviction. He said he was simply trying to reclaim his stolen property from two sports memorabilia dealers. While Simpson wasn't armed when he confronted the men, at least two of his associates were.\n\nCook said after a trial he got a call from the Clark County prosecutor. 'They said come and pick up your stuff.'\n\nCook says the memorabilia items amounted to nine deflated game balls, plaques, a tie, sunglasses and family pictures. They gave the items back to Simpson when there were questions over their authenticity, since they didn't come directly from him.\n\nMoving forward\n\nRelying on the 1997 civil judgment, Cook says his clients will pursue any income that Simpson might generate, especially in the entertainment realm. 'I can levy the entity,' the attorney said. 'I can grab all of the intellectual property in that entity itself.'\n\nJUST WATCHED Former lawyer: O.J. must toe the mark Replay More Videos ...

'They have suffered as much as Fred has, that's true,' said Cook. 'They live in this other world where there's been a civil court who ruled that their father murdered their mother.'\n\nCook said the point of the ongoing collection effort is not the money, but the principle.\n\n'There is no closure,' he said. 'There's one thing which is obscene in Fred Goldman's vocabulary. It's called closure. There is no closure because closure means there is some sense of Judeo-Christian forgiveness business -- and that's just not gonna happen here.

"Tiger Woods' DUI arrest: Golfer appears confused in dashcam video\n(CNN) During Tiger Woods' enormously successful career, cameras often showed the golfer confidently striding the course, smashing records and winning events in front of adoring fans and massive television audiences.\n\nBut in police dashcam video released Wednesday , the world's former No. 1 golfer provided a different image to an audience of police officers in the dead of the night.\n\nThe video of Woods' Memorial Day encounter with police provided more details on his arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence.\n\nIn video from Florida's Jupiter Police Department, gone is his confident strut on the golf course -- instead replaced by a man struggling to walk and stand on one leg.\n\nIt shows Woods stumbling through field sobriety tests, wobbling on the side of the road and at times confused about officers' commands.\n\nWoods was led away in handcuffs about 24 minutes into the video.\n\nWhen news of his arrest first surfaced, Woods said he made a mistake by misunderstanding the effects of the medications he was taking.\n\n'I understand the severity of what I did, and I take full responsibility for my actions,' he said in a statement.\n\nSobriety tests\n\nAnother video of the initial traffic stop shows the view from an officer's car as he pulls up to Woods' car, which is almost halfway out of the right lane, sticking into a bike lane.\n\nThe footage marks the latest twist in an incident that started early Monday , when police found the legendary golfer sleeping alone in his Mercedes Benz near his home in Jupiter, Florida.\n\nDuring the roadside stop, police administered a series of sobriety tests. Woods struggled to walk in a straight line, had a hard time following instructions and slurred his speech several times.\n\nHe said he had not been drinking but admits to taking medication -- the name of which is muted in the recording.\n\nIn one of the tests, the officer asked Woods to follow a red light with his eyes. The officer moves the light but stops and says, 'You're not even looking at the light.'\n\nWoods tells the officer he is 'following the light,' his words running together. He also has trouble following directions and reciting the alphabet. At one point, he starts to walk away, then stumbles back, saying, 'What are we doing?'\n\nHe also appears to be unaware of his surroundings.\n\nThe officer asks him where he's coming from and he appears to say he's headed to Los Angeles's Orange County, even though he'd previously said he was going to Jupiter.\n\nWoods: No alcohol\n\nWoods told officers he did not drink, but takes several prescription medications, according to a police report. He took a Breathalyzer test, registering 0.000 on it both times, and a urine test, records show.\n\nOne of the reports said Woods had to be awakened and that his speech was slow and slurred but that he was 'cooperative.'\n\nIn a statement after his arrest Monday -- before the video surfaced -- Woods said alcohol was not involved, blaming his disorientation on 'an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications.'\n\nWoods, who has been rehabbing from back surgery, said he didn't realize the mix of medications would affect him so strongly.\n\nHe was arrested about 3 a.m. and released a few hours later on his own recognizance with no bond, according to records. He was cited for DUI and improper parking, and will be arraigned on July 5.\n\nThe 41-year-old golfer has undergone multiple back surgeries, including one a month ago, and hasn't played competitive golf since he pulled out of the Dubai Desert Classic in February.\n\nWoods has won 14 major tournaments, second only to Jack Nicklaus.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/01/us/tiger-woods-dui-dashcam-video/index.html","1496289600.0"
"China urges 'restraint' amid North Korea sinking threat\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption North Korea is continuing with missiles tests and there are fears it may conduct another nuclear test\n\nChina's president has called for 'restraint' from all parties in a call with US President Donald Trump, a day after Pyongyang said it was 'ready' to sink a US aircraft carrier.\n\nThe telephone conversation is the second between the two leaders since they met in Florida earlier this month.\n\nIt highlights Chinese fears that tensions between the US and North Korea could erupt into conflict.\n\nMr Trump criticised Pyongyang's belligerence, the White House said.\n\nOn Sunday state media said North Korea's forces were 'combat-ready to sink' US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, which the US says is due to arrive off the Korean peninsula 'within days'.\n\nThe aircraft carrier was despatched by Mr Trump amid a warning that US 'strategic patience' over the North's nuclear ambitions had come to an end.\n\nThe bombastic message - the ruling Workers' Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun called the carrier a 'gross animal' - was the latest in a series of bellicose statements and threats from Pyongyang.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The USS Carl Vinson (left) and other warships were in the Indian Ocean over the weekend\n\nIn the telephone call, Mr Xi urged all parties to 'maintain restraint and avoid actions that would increase tensions', according to the Chinese foreign ministry.\n\nThe White House said Mr Trump 'emphasised that Pyongyang's actions are destabilising the Korean Peninsula'.\n\nThe two leaders met on 7-8 April at Mr Trump's Florida resort and then spoke about North Korea by telephone on 12 April, as tensions rose.\n\nPyongyang says it will press ahead with missile tests despite Mr Trump's warnings. Experts also believe that it may be preparing for another nuclear test, defying UN resolutions.\n\nTuesday is the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army and North Korea has previously marked such anniversaries with missile or nuclear tests.\n\nChina has traditionally been North Korea's ally and the nation with the most influence over Pyongyang, but its stance towards its northern neighbour appears to be hardening.\n\nIn recent weeks it has faced repeated calls from the US to impose tougher financial sanctions that would hurt the regime in Pyongyang.\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that call between the two leaders was a sign of their close communication.\n\nTimeline of recent tensions\n\nThe US president also held telephone talks on North Korea with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe on Monday. The two agreed to 'keep a high level of vigilance and respond firmly', Mr Abe said afterwards.\n\nTwo Japanese destroyers have joined the carrier group for exercises. Envoys from the US, South Korea and Japan are also due to meet in Japan on Tuesday to discuss the current crisis.\n\nNorth Korea says its nuclear programme is defensive but it is trying to develop weapons small enough to put on ballistic missiles.\n\nThere is no evidence yet it has done so or that it has missiles with the range to reach long-distance targets like the US mainland, but experts believe it will achieve these goals in the future.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39695503","None"
"Catalonia independence: Spain pushes to remove leaders\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Some 450,000 people protested on Saturday, local police said\n\nThe Spanish prime minister has outlined plans to remove Catalonia's leaders and take control of the separatist region.\n\nSpeaking after an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday, Mariano Rajoy stopped short of dissolving the region's parliament but put forward plans for elections.\n\nThe measures must now be approved by Spain's Senate in the next few days.\n\nThe Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Carme Forcadell, called the measures a 'de facto coup d'etat'.\n\n'It is an authoritarian coup inside a member state of the European Union,' she said, adding that Mr Rajoy intended to 'put an end to a democratically elected government'.\n\nLarge crowds have gathered in Barcelona to protest against direct rule from Madrid.\n\nIt comes almost three weeks after Catalonia held a disputed independence referendum.\n\nSpain's supreme court had declared the vote illegal and said it violated the constitution, which describes the country as indivisible.\n\nCatalan leader Carles Puigdemont has ignored pleas from the national government to abandon moves towards independence.\n\nMr Rajoy said the the Catalan government's actions were 'contrary to the law and seeking confrontation'.

The article has never been invoked before, so there was a certain amount of mystery surrounding its potential reach and meaning.\n\nAlthough Mr Rajoy insisted that Catalonia's self-government is not being suspended, many will disagree. The removal from office of Carles Puigdemont and all the members of his cabinet, to allow ministers in Madrid to take on their duties, amounts to a major reining in of Catalonia's devolved powers.\n\nThe Spanish prime minister said that one of his aims is to restore peaceful co-existence to Catalonia with these measures. Many Catalans who want to remain in Spain will approve of this strident action. But those who want independence for their region are likely to see this as a provocation rather than a solution.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nCatalonia's regional government held a referendum on 1 October to ask residents of the region if they wanted to break away from Spain.\n\nOf the 43% of Catalans said to have taken part, 90% voted in favour of independence. But many anti-independence supporters boycotted the ballot, arguing it was not valid.\n\nMr Puigdemont and other regional leaders then signed a declaration of independence, but immediately suspended it in order to allow for talks.\n\nHe then defied two deadlines set by the national government to clarify Catalonia's position.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why is there a Catalan crisis?

"What August showed us about America\n(CNN) One August in America tested the nation's mettle. Years from now, that's what historians will say.\n\nHarvests traditionally begin in August, and last month in Charlottesville the United States reaped the bitter product of its divisions. But as the month went on we also found ways to come together through a celestial phenomenon and a vicious act of Mother Nature.\n\nBoth the eclipse and Harvey reminded us how minuscule we are. And maybe we needed some perspective.\n\nIt's been a divisive spell in American history, a time when we've disagreed bitterly on the country's direction and shunned dialogue and debate, choosing instead to seek affirmation of our opinions in echo chambers.\n\nThere's been no middle ground, just quicksand. We were bound to boil over, historians might write.\n\nWatch the sun go dark again and again\n\nWatch the sun go dark again and again 01:38\n\nWatch the sun go dark again and again\n\nThen we paused to marvel at the moon crossing the sun, which united us in awe. Five days later, a hurricane swamped Texas, and we set aside our differences to show empathy for our stricken countrymen and women. Neighbors came with rescue boats, houses of worship opened their doors to evacuees and Americans rushed to donate money.\n\nSuddenly, Charlottesville seemed like a long time ago.\n\nTorches and tragedy\n\nWhen they look back on the 31 days that just passed, historians may first seize upon August 11, the day white nationalists stormed Charlottesville, Virginia\n\nOn a campus founded by our third president and the author of a document proclaiming 'all men are created equal,' an angry mob, mostly white and mostly male, marched with torches to claim Thomas Jefferson's words -- seminal to our country's creation -- meant nothing.\n\nThey decried Jews, blacks, Latinos, immigrants, anyone who doesn't look and behave like them. For older Southerners, it resurrected memories of the night rides, when robe-clad cowards on horseback terrorized people of color below the Mason-Dixon line.\n\nThese so-called loyalists arrived on a campus and in a town where they weren't welcome, to pursue a cause as specious as their patriotism: defending a statue of a long-dead general who lost a rebellion against the country to which we pledge allegiance.\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows what happened in Charlottesville Replay More Videos ...

For one group, anger was a reaction; for the other, a state of being.\n\nWhile historians will write about the hate and violence -- the clubs, the tear gas, the crude shields with symbols of white supremacy -- there were heroes that weekend, too.\n\nA 26-year-old landscaper was badly injured saving his beloved from a Dodge that roared into a knot of counterprotesters. Then, there's Heather Heyer . We should say her name often so we don't forget it.\n\nHeather Heyer.\n\nLet's hope historians remember her, too.\n\nHeyer was a voice for the disenfranchised, friends say, but no one could push her out of the way of martyrdom. She died that Saturday defending people whose value, she believed, was not up for debate.\n\nAgainst arguably the most schismatic political backdrop the nation has seen in 152 years, white nationalists promised to usher demonstrations into more cities. Counterprotesters and self-proclaimed anti-fascists vowed to be there when they arrived.\n\nOn social media, the world wondered, 'WTF?' Americans asked if their country was marching backward, seeking to repeat the mistakes that had been millstones on its progress. Racist memes littered Twitter, leaving some dejected souls to complain they'd lost faith in humanity.\n\nA cosmic interlude\n\nThe country deserved a respite, and it soon received one, if for only the 3 minutes or so that the moon managed to blot out the sun. For that wondrous moment, and the giddy hours leading up to it, our differences were irrelevant\n\nIt didn't matter if you were Democrat or Republican, black or white, Team Taylor or Team Kanye. Americans from South Carolina to Oregon gathered at rooftops, parking decks, campgrounds and patios to gaze skyward to a spectacle 240,000 miles away.\n\nIt was awesome , literally, and when we took off those goofy cardboard glasses, there were smiles all around, a collective appreciation of forces grander than us or anything, good or bad, we might create.\n\nHistorians might write it was the grounding America needed. They just might.\n\nBecause as our excitement over the eclipse waned, like the moon cycling to its own rebirth, a monster storm was building in the Gulf.\n\nHarvey's heroes\n\nWhen Harvey struck Texas , with a ferocity experts say the Lone Star State has not seen in more than a century, millions found themselves in its path.\n\nIt was dubbed a '1,000-year event,' but scientists studying climate change -- yet another source of our division -- say a warming planet is propelling extreme weather onto the Gulf Coast with alarming regularity. Texas alone experienced 500-year weather events in 2015 and 2016.\n\nHarvey's 130-mph winds lashed the coast, and rain fell in cascades. Like it might never stop.\n\nToo many braved the deluge, believing the storm, like some before it, would bring more bluster than obliteration. Soon, officials across southeastern Texas said resources were stretched so thin that rescuers were being forced to make the most unenviable of decisions: who should be saved first.\n\nJUST WATCHED Harvey brings 'hell' to Texas residents Replay More Videos ...

Rescuers dangled from helicopters and charged into rushing floodwaters to pluck Texans from danger. Corporations and celebrities used their power and platforms to raise millions in disaster relief. Journalists put down their notepads and microphones to lift folks out of the water\n\nIn one of the most selfless acts of heroism, the Cajun Navy -- a band of regular ol' Louisianans who cut their teeth in the rescue game during Katrina -- jumped in their trucks and hauled a flotilla of boats west to save their neighbors.\n\nTexas prides itself on going big, and the state will have to do just that as it begins a recovery effort that will last years. But if there can be any silver lining to such a deadly and horrific storm, it's that in Americans' response to it, we gave those who lost faith in humanity two weeks earlier reason to believe again.\n\nIn the grand scheme, whatever that may be, we can be defined by what we do going forward and how we put aside differences to uplift our fellow Americans, no matter their race or religion or politics.\n\nWe should hope that's what history reveals about us in August 2017.\n\nCharlottesville exposed our divisions.

"Germany's Merkel Signals Deepening Rift With U.S. Under Trump\n'All I can say is that we Europeans must really take our destiny into our own hands,' the German leader told the crowd of some 2,500 during a campaign event at a beer tent in Bavaria. 'The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over, as I have experienced in the past few days.'\n\nWhile Merkel never mentioned President Donald Trump by name, her blunt remarks followed a bruising series of meetings with the U.S. president at the NATO summit in Belgium and then at the G-7 gathering in Italy.\n\nTrump sent a tweet criticizing Germany early Tuesday.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump did not explicitly promise to protect America's NATO allies if they came under attack, instead alleging 23 out of the 28-member nations owed 'massive amounts of money' to U.S. taxpayers. The U.S.-led NATO alliance made up mainly by European countries has for decades been a bulwark against the Soviet and then Russian aggression.\n\nAt the G-7 summit, European and other diplomats were frustrated that Trump refused to endorse a global climate change accord and said he needed more time to decide. Trump was also quoted as calling Germany 'very bad' on trade — but the White House denied it.\n\n'Solidarity for Donald Trump is a commodity, only available with advance payment' 'Solidarity for Donald Trump is a commodity, only available with advance payment'\n\nMerkel's comments were made on the election trail and therefore directed at a domestic audience as much as to an international one.\n\nMichael van Hulten, a fellow at the London School of Economics, called Merkel’s speech “huge — German chancellor signalling the end of the post-WW2 Western consensus.”\n\nGermany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper stated that Sunday's comments showed 'Merkel no longer regards the USA as reliable.'\n\nElmar Thevessen, the deputy editor-in-chief at German public broadcaster ZDF, said that 'Merkel sent a very important signal' from Europe.\n\n'[French President Emmanuel] Macron and other European leaders seemed to have the same takeaway' from the encounter with Trump and his delegation at NATO's headquarters and the G-7, he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel enjoys a beer during an election campaign in Munich on Sunday. Christian Bruna / EPA\n\nIn an op-ed, Thevessen suggested that the summits offered insight into Trump's approach to foreign affairs, which he summed up as ''America first and only.' Responsibility for the world — no chance.'\n\n'Solidarity for Donald Trump is a commodity, only available with advance payment,' Thevessen added. 'I am not a psychologist, but am judging as a political scientist and journalist: this U.S. president is dangerous. We Europeans can do nothing against it.'\n\nMartin Schulz, Merkel's main challenger in the September federal election, told German broadcaster ZDF that 'we have to make clear to the United States that they are isolated, they are also isolated on their own continent.'\n\nOn Monday, AFP also quoted Germany’s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying that Trump’s actions had “weakened” the West.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/germany-s-merkel-signals-deepening-rift-u-s-under-trump-n765781","None"
"The Alternative 'Russia Scandal'\nThe Alternative 'Russia Scandal'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Craig Ruttle/AP Craig Ruttle/AP\n\nAccording to President Trump, some Republicans in Congress and conservative media outlets, the Russia scandal is heating up.\n\nNo, not that one.\n\nIt's an alternative Russia scandal. And the claims go like this:\n\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton approved the 2010 sale of a mining company to Russia. This gave the Russians control of 20 percent of U.S. uranium and placed U.S. national security at risk. In return, the Clinton Foundation received $145 million in pledges and donations.\n\nTrump made this allegation during the 2016 campaign and again in an Oct. 19 tweet.\n\nIn the face of repeated fact checks, the president's claims have not withstood scrutiny. The president's critics call them part of an effort to divert attention from Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nBut because the story keeps surfacing and key Republicans are calling for hearings, here is a closer look.\n\nClaim: Clinton played a key role in helping Russia gain control of U.S. uranium supplies.\n\nThe Russian state nuclear company, Rosatom, bought Canadian mining company Uranium One in 2010. Uranium One had, and still has, uranium mining rights in the United States.\n\nFor that reason, President Barack Obama's administration had to approve the deal. In a unanimous vote, nine U.S. government departments and agencies signed off. All are part of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and included Clinton's State Department.\n\nBy all accounts, she was not actively involved. One of her deputies handled the matter, which was not considered controversial because uranium is widely bought and sold around the world for a range of purposes, from nuclear power plant fuel to medical treatments and research.\n\n'It's a commercial market; it's a global market. Companies get bought and sold. Some of the companies that do the buying are controlled by foreign governments,' said Matthew Bunn, who heads the Project on Managing the Atom, a nuclear policy research group at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 'That's the world we live in. It's a totally normal purchase.'\n\nClaim: Uranium One controls 20 percent of the U.S. uranium supply.\n\nAt the time of the 2010 sale, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimated that Uranium One held the rights to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium in the ground. But this figure is misleading.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that it is also outdated. It was based on uranium production capacity in 2010, which has since greatly expanded. Uranium One's share of mining rights is now far less than 20 percent of the U.S. total.\n\nWhat is more, the U.S. is a tiny player in the world uranium market. The U.S. produced 1,126 tons of uranium last year out of global production of more than 62,000 tons, according to the World Nuclear Association. So U.S. production is less than 2 percent of the global total.\n\nUranium One produces a small and dwindling amount of that U.S. figure. Last year, it mined just 23 tons in the U.S. — about 2 percent of the small U.S. production.\n\nThink of Uranium One's share as 2 percent of 2 percent. Or 0.04 percent of world production.\n\nSome of Uranium One's U.S. uranium has gone to Canada and Europe, according to The Hill newspaper. But there is no evidence that any of it has gone to Russia.\n\nRosatom's more likely motivation for purchasing Uranium One was to gain access to the company's far larger uranium production in Canada and in Kazakhstan, which borders Russia.\n\nClaim: U.S. national security has been put at risk.\n\nNeither the U.S. nor Russia needs highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. The countries have more than 4,000 deployed or stockpiled weapons each, far more than the rest of the world combined. Both still have leftover stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that date to the Cold War.\n\n'Both the United States and Russia, for some time, have had self-imposed moratoria on the production of weapons-grade nuclear material,' said Kingston Reif, director of disarmament at the Arms Control Association in Washington, D.C. 'Despite this, both the United States and Russia remain awash in highly-enriched uranium.'\n\nUnder a program known as Megatons to Megawatts, Russia reduced its excess by dismantling nuclear weapons and sending the blended-down uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants.\n\n'About 10 percent of U.S. electricity was coming from dismantled Russian nuclear warheads that used to be pointed at the United States,' said Bunn, who worked on this issue at the White House during President Bill Clinton's administration.\n\nThat program expired in 2013, though Russia still sells uranium to U.S. nuclear plants.\n\nClaim: The Clinton Foundation received $145 million in pledges and donations in exchange for the State Department's support of the Russian deal.\n\nAuthor Peter Schweizer, who worked with Steve Bannon at Breitbart News, first made this claim in a 2015 book called Clinton Cash.\n\nThe New York Times said it used Schweizer's work to conduct its own investigation.\n\nPolitiFact also looked into the matter and questioned the $145 million figure, noting that most of the donations and pledges came from Canadian businessman Frank Giustra, a friend of Bill Clinton. They were together in Kazakhstan in 2005, on a trip during which Giustra signed a major mining deal with that country, the Times reported.\n\nTwo years later, in 2007, Giustra merged his mining company with Uranium One and then sold his shares the same year. This was three years before the Russians bought the company, so it's not clear how Giustra would have benefited from the 2010 deal.\n\nGiustra noted this in a 2015 statement in which he sharply criticized the Times for suggesting that his work with the Clintons was in pursuit of a business favor.\n\n'I am extremely proud of the work that we have done' with the Clintons, he said. 'I plan to continue that work long after the harsh glare of this week's media stories has faded.'\n\nAside from Giustra, PolitiFact said its reporting could confirm about $4 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors in the years just before and after the 2010 Russian deal.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation supports a wide variety of humanitarian projects around the world.\n\nThis episode raises the familiar scenario of overlap between the Clinton's private dealings and public actions and the potential for conflicts of interest. Yet a number of Clinton critics and news organizations have looked into the matter and have not presented evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nAs the Times concluded in its 2015 story:\n\n'Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown. But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/06/561587174/the-alternative-russia-scandal","1509944400.0"
"North Korea nuclear crisis: Putin warns of planetary catastrophe\nAs Kim Jong-un reportedly prepares further missile launch, Russian president says further sanctions would be ‘useless’\n\nWhy didn’t the US shoot down North Korea’s missile? Maybe because it couldn’t | Joshua Pollack Read more\n\nThe Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has warned that the escalating North Korean crisis could cause a “planetary catastrophe” and huge loss of life, and described US proposals for further sanctions on Pyongyang as “useless”.\n\n\n\n“Ramping up military hysteria in such conditions is senseless; it’s a dead end,” he told reporters in China. “It could lead to a global, planetary catastrophe and a huge loss of human life. There is no other way to solve the North Korean nuclear issue, save that of peaceful dialogue.”\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea carried out its sixth and by far its most powerful nuclear test to date. The underground blast triggered a magnitude-6.3 earthquake and was more powerful than the bombs dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the second world war.\n\nPutin was attending the Brics summit, bringing together the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Speaking on Tuesday, the final day of the summit in Xiamen, China, he said Russia condemned North Korea’s provocations but said further sanctions would be useless and ineffective, describing the measures as a “road to nowhere”.\n\n\n\nForeign interventions in Iraq and Libya had convinced the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that he needed nuclear weapons to survive, Putin said.\n\n“We all remember what happened with Iraq and Saddam Hussein. His children were killed, I think his grandson was shot, the whole country was destroyed and Saddam Hussein was hanged ... We all know how this happened and people in North Korea remember well what happened in Iraq.\n\n\n\n“They will eat grass but will not stop their [nuclear] programme as long as they do not feel safe.”\n\n\n\nHow the nuclear-armed nations brought the North Korea crisis on themselves Read more\n\nA US bid for the United Nations security council to vote on 11 September on new sanctions is “a little premature,” Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s UN ambassador, said on Tuesday. Russia is a permanent member of the security council and has veto power.\n\nThe US’s top diplomat acknowledged that more sanctions on North Korea are unlikely to change its behaviour, but insisted that they would cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.\n\n“Do we think more sanctions are going to work on North Korea? Not necessarily,” Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, told a thinktank in Washington. “But what does it do? It cuts off the revenue that allows them to build ballistic missiles.”\n\nDiplomats have said the security council could consider banning North Korean textile exports, banishing its national airline and stopping supplies of oil to the government and military. Other measures could include preventing North Koreans from working abroad and adding top officials to a blacklist aiming at imposing asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nChina accounted for 92% of North Korea’s trade in 2016, according to South Korea’s government. China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it would take part in security council discussions in “a responsible and constructive manner”.\n\n\n\nBut China is likely to block any measure that could cause instability and topple the regime of Kim Jong-un, sparking a refugee crisis and potentially allowing tens of thousands of South Korean and US troops to move north as far as the Chinese border.\n\nQ&A What threat does North Korea pose to South Korea? Show Hide The North may have found a way to make a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile, but firing one at the South is likely to provoke retaliation in kind, which would end the regime. Pyongyang has enough conventional artillery to do significant damage to Seoul, but the quality of its gunners and munitions is dubious, and the same problem – retaliation from the South and its allies - remains. In the event of a non-nuclear attack, Seoul's residents would act on years of experience of civil defence drills, and rush to the bomb shelters dotted around the city, increasing their chances of survival.\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe spoke by telephone on Tuesday and agreed that sanctions against Pyongyang should be stepped up.\n\nThe row over further sanctions came as South Korea refused to rule out redeploying US tactical nuclear weapons on its territory – a move that could seriously harm efforts to ease tensions as signs emerged that Pyongyang was preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on or around 9 September, when it celebrates its founding day.\n\nSeoul has routinely dismissed the option of basing US nuclear weapons on South Korean soil for the first time since the 1990s, but the country’s defence minister, Song Young-moo, said “all available military options” were being considered to address the growing threat from North Korean missiles.\n\nKim Hyun-wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul, said: “No one in South Korea is seriously proposing that the US reintroduce strategic assets [such as nuclear weapons]. That’s something they might discuss further down the line, but there are no plans for that to happen right now.”\n\nBut calls have also been growing in South Korea for the country to develop a nuclear deterrent independent of the US.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Korean warships conducted live-fire drills, with further exercises planned this week. “If the enemy launches a provocation above water or under water, we will immediately hit back to bury them at sea,” said Capt Choi Young-chan, commander of the 13th Maritime Battle Group.\n\nThe drills came hours after Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, agreed “in principle” to remove restrictions on the size of Seoul’s missile warheads and approved a deal to sell it “many billions of dollars’” worth of US military weapons and equipment.\n\nWashington appears to have moved to ease South Korean doubts about US commitment to its security after Trump openly accused its east Asian ally of “appeasing” Pyongyang by holding out for a negotiated solution to its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to a nuclear disarmament conference on Tuesday, North Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, described Pyongyang’s nuclear test as a “gift package” for the US.\n\n“The recent self-defence measures by my country, DPRK, are a gift package addressed to none other than the US,” said Han Tae Song. “The US will receive more ‘gift packages’ from my country as long as its relies on reckless provocations and futile attempts to put pressure on the DPRK,” he added without elaborating.\n\nNorth Korea has been observed moving what appeared to be a long-range missile towards its west coast, according to South Korea’s Asia Business Daily. The newspaper claimed the missile had been transported towards the launch site overnight on Monday to avoid surveillance.\n\nQ&A How does a hydrogen bomb differ from an atomic bomb? Show Hide The difference lies in the heart of the bomb. Atomic bombs rely on nuclear fission to produce a blast: atoms of weapons-grade uranium or plutonium are split by neutrons, releasing energy as well as more neutrons - triggering a chain reaction.\n\nHydrogen bombs incorporate nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. As in an atomic bomb, fission generates neutrons and energy. This energy is used to kick off the fusion of 'heavy” types of hydrogen in another part of the bomb. The fusion reaction also releases energy and neutrons, which then trigger further fission reactions. The upshot is a far more powerful blast. A boosted atomic bomb is a sort of hybrid of the two approaches, using a small quantity of fusion material together with an atomic bomb core. It is not as powerful as a hydrogen bomb.\n\nSouth Korea’s defence ministry said it was unable to confirm the report, although ministry officials told parliament on Monday the Pyongyang regime was preparing to launch more missiles.\n\nOn Monday, the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, accused North Korea of “begging for war”, adding that the time had come for the security council to impose “the strongest possible” sanctions after Sunday’s test of what Pyongyang claimed was a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded on to an ICBM.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/05/south-korea-minister-redeploying-us-nuclear-weapons-tensions-with-north","1504584000.0"
"'What kind of society do you want to live in?': Inside the country where Down syndrome is disappearing\n'CBSN: On Assignment' airs Mondays at 10 p.m. ET/PT on CBS and on our streaming network, CBSN. Explore more on this topic in our 'Behind the Lens' report.\n\nWith the rise of prenatal screening tests across Europe and the United States, the number of babies born with Down syndrome has significantly decreased, but few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland.\n\nSince prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women -- close to 100 percent -- who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy.\n\nWhile the tests are optional, the government states that all expectant mothers must be informed about availability of screening tests, which reveal the likelihood of a child being born with Down syndrome. Around 80 to 85 percent of pregnant women choose to take the prenatal screening test, according to Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik.\n\n'CBSN: On Assignment' headed to Iceland with CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano to investigate what's factoring into the high termination rates.\n\nUsing an ultrasound, blood test and the mother's age, the test, called the Combination Test, determines whether the fetus will have a chromosome abnormality, the most common of which results in Down syndrome. Children born with this genetic disorder have distinctive facial issues and a range of developmental issues. Many people born with Down syndrome can live full, healthy lives, with an average lifespan of around 60 years.\n\nOther countries aren't lagging too far behind in Down syndrome termination rates. According to the most recent data available, the United States has an estimated termination rate for Down syndrome of 67 percent (1995-2011); in France it's 77 percent (2015); and Denmark, 98 percent (2015). The law in Iceland permits abortion after 16 weeks if the fetus has a deformity -- and Down syndrome is included in this category.\n\nCBS News\n\nWith a population of around 330,000, Iceland has on average just one or two children born with Down syndrome per year, sometimes after their parents received inaccurate test results. (In the U.S., according to the National Down Syndrome Society, about 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born each year.)\n\n'Babies with Down syndrome are still being born in Iceland,' said Hulda Hjartardottir, head of the Prenatal Diagnosis Unit at Landspitali University Hospital, where around 70 percent of Icelandic children are born. 'Some of them were low risk in our screening test, so we didn't find them in our screening.'\n\nWhen Thordis Ingadottir was pregnant with her third child at the age of 40, she took the screening test. The results showed her chances of having a child with Down syndrome were very slim, odds of 1 in 1,600. However, the screening test is only 85 percent accurate. That year, 2009, three babies were born with Down syndrome in Iceland, including Ingadottir's daughter Agusta, who is now 7.\n\nCBS News\n\nAccording to Ingadottir, three babies born with Down syndrome is 'quite more than usual. Normally there are two, in the last few years.' Since the birth of her daughter, Ingadottir has become an activist for the rights of people with Down syndrome.\n\nAs Agusta grows up, 'I will hope that she will be fully integrated on her own terms in this society. That's my dream,' Ingadottir said. 'Isn't that the basic needs of life? What kind of society do you want to live in?'\n\nGeneticist Kari Stefansson is the founder of deCODE Genetics, a company that has studied nearly the entire Icelandic population's genomes. He has a unique perspective on the advancement of medical technology. 'My understanding is that we have basically eradicated, almost, Down syndrome from our society -- that there is hardly ever a child with Down syndrome in Iceland anymore,' he said.\n\nQuijano asked Stefansson, 'What does the 100 percent termination rate, you think, reflect about Icelandic society?'\n\n'It reflects a relatively heavy-handed genetic counseling,' he said. 'And I don't think that heavy-handed genetic counseling is desirable. … You're having impact on decisions that are not medical, in a way.'\n\nStefansson noted, 'I don't think there's anything wrong with aspiring to have healthy children, but how far we should go in seeking those goals is a fairly complicated decision.'\n\nAccording to Hjartardottir, 'We try to do as neutral counseling as possible, but some people would say that just offering the test is pointing you towards a certain direction.' Indeed, more than 4 out of 5 pregnant women in Iceland opt for the prenatal screening test.\n\nFor expectant mother Bergthori Einarsdottir, who chose to have the test, knowing that most women did so helped steer her decision. 'It was not pressure, but they told me that most women did it,' she said. 'It did affect me maybe a little bit.'\n\nOver at Landspitali University Hospital, Helga Sol Olafsdottir counsels women who have a pregnancy with a chromosomal abnormality. They speak to her when deciding whether to continue or end their pregnancies. Olafsdottir tells women who are wrestling with the decision or feelings of guilt: 'This is your life — you have the right to choose how your life will look like.'\n\nShe showed Quijano a prayer card inscribed with the date and tiny footprints of a fetus that was terminated.\n\nQuijano noted, 'In America, I think some people would be confused about people calling this 'our child,' saying a prayer or saying goodbye or having a priest come in -- because to them abortion is murder.'\n\nOlafsdottir responded, 'We don't look at abortion as a murder. We look at it as a thing that we ended. We ended a possible life that may have had a huge complication... preventing suffering for the child and for the family. And I think that is more right than seeing it as a murder -- that's so black and white. Life isn't black and white. Life is grey.'","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/down-syndrome-iceland/","None"

"Zimbabwe's Army Seizes Control, Detains Mugabe And His Wife\nZimbabwe's Army Seizes Control, Detains Mugabe And His Wife\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 6:05 a.m. ET Wednesday\n\nZimbabwe's army said Wednesday that it has seized control in what is being described as 'a bloodless transition' that has apparently pushed aside President Robert Mugabe. The military said he and his family are 'safe and sound.'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP\n\nArmored vehicles and soldiers patrolled streets in the capital, Harare, amid loud explosions overnight. Soldiers reportedly took control of the headquarters of the national broadcaster, ZBC, and an army spokesman said on air: 'This is not a military takeover.'\n\n'We are only targeting criminals around [Mugabe], who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country, in order to bring them to justice,' according to the statement.\n\nHowever, just a week after Mugabe, 93, fired longtime vice president and liberation war veteran Emmerson Mnangagwa, accusing him of disloyalty and disrespect, an account purporting to belong to the ruling ZANU-PF party tweeted that Mnangagwa had been installed as the party's interim president.\n\nThe apparent putsch, which the military is refusing to call a coup, marks the first time in Mugabe's 37-year rule that a public rift was visible between the military and the world's oldest head of state, who has been in office since the end of white minority rule in 1980.\n\nInitially, the governing party accused Army Chief Gen. Constantino Chiwenga of 'treasonous conduct,' but the party's account later tweeted: 'There was no coup,' but instead 'a bloodless transition which saw corrupt and crooked persons being arrested.' Apparently referring to Mugabe, the tweet said that 'an elderly man who had been taken advantage of by his wife [was] detained.'\n\nThe ZANU-PF Twitter account retweeted a message from the party's youth league that said, 'The army is simply effecting a National Democratic Project and it's doing so with peaceful aplomb.'\n\nIn the army's overnight broadcast, spokesman Gen. Sibusiso Moyo said the military expected 'normalcy' to return as soon as the army had completed its 'mission.'\n\nChiwenga had made an unprecedented announcement Monday that the army was prepared to intervene to halt party infighting and the purging of veterans, such as Mnangagwa, who fought Zimbabwe's independence war.\n\nMnangagwa had been tipped as a likely successor to Mugabe, but fell foul of the president's powerful wife, Grace Mugabe. His removal was widely perceived as a prelude to Mugabe promoting the politically ambitious but controversial first lady to one of two vice presidential posts.\n\nIn a statement attributed to Mnangagwa at the time he reportedly left for self-imposed exile, he promised to return to Zimbabwe to 'lead' the country, warning Mugabe that the ZANU-PF party was not his personal property.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy closed to the public and encouraged citizens to shelter in place, citing 'the ongoing political uncertainty through the night.' The British Embassy issued a similar warning and noted 'reports of unusual military activity.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/14/564237707/tensions-increase-in-zimbabwe-as-troops-reportedly-patrol-the-capital","1510635600.0"

All votes from precincts around the state have been counted.\n\nThe margin of victory is well above the half a percentage point which would have triggered a recount.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Roy Moore: 'It is not over'\n\nBut Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, quoted by the Washington Post, said a recount could still be ordered if a review of write-in votes and overseas ballots narrowed it to within this range.\n\nOverseas ballots can continue to come in until the seventh day after the election, ie 19 December, the Department of Defense's Federal Voting Assistance Program says.\n\nThere was a total of 1.7% of votes for write-ins, where voters wrote in names of candidates who did not appear on the ballot paper.\n\nEven if the final result is outside the 0.5% margin, either candidate can request a recount if they are prepared to pay the costs, Alabama officials say.\n\nMr Moore, a 70-year-old former judge, told his supporters it was not yet over.\n\n'We've been painted in an unfavourable and unfaithful light,' he said. 'Realise that when the vote is this close that it's not over.'\n\nAlthough Mr Moore did not concede, President Trump congratulated Mr Jones in a tweet shortly after US media declared him the winner, adding that 'Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time'.\n\nThe Senate seat will come up for re-election in November 2020.\n\nLater, the president tweeted that he had endorsed Mr Moore's opponent in the Republican primary, Luther Strange, because he thought the former judge 'could not win a general election', adding that 'the deck was stacked against him'.\n\nWho is Doug Jones?\n\nMr Jones told his supporters in a victory speech that the 'entire race has been about dignity and respect'.\n\n'This campaign has been about the rule of law. This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which zip code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life,' he said before the crowd erupted in cheers.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Doug Jones: 'We have shown America the way'\n\nThe 63-year-old is a former lawyer known for helping convict two Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a black church in 1963 in Birmingham, killing four girls.

"Guns were Black Friday must-haves, going by the FBI’s record 203,086 background-check requests\n\n\nRyan Salmon fires an assault rifle at the Lynchburg Arms & Indoor Shooting Range in Lynchburg, Va. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFor decades, the term “Black Friday” has conjured up distinct images: turkey-stuffed consumers awake at insanely early hours of the morning, bursting into big-box stores to fight over flat-screen TVs.\n\nBut in a muzzle flash, it seems, a new image may be replacing that stereotype. It involves a trigger and, possibly, a scope.\n\nOn Friday, the FBI received 203,086 requests for instant gun background checks, according to USA Today — nearly a 10 percent increase from the year before and a new record for background checks in a single day.\n\nThat’s not an anomaly. According to the FBI, the previous two records for background checks were also set on the day after the federal holiday in which Americans give thanks for the year’s blessings.\n\nThe FBI didn’t provide any analysis behind the spike, but the biggest shopping day of the year may come at a moment of worry for people who fear someone from the government may knock on their door someday and confiscate their guns.\n\nOn Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed the FBI and ATF to look at potential problems in the National Instant Criminal Background Check system (NICS).\n\nSessions wants the agencies to fix problems with how the military and other federal entities report convictions that could keep someone from having a gun.\n\n[‘I can’t do this again’: Why a congressman walked out of moment of silence for Texas victims]\n\nThe database “is critically important to protecting the American public from firearms related violence,” Sessions wrote in his memo. “It is, however, only as reliable and robust as the information that federal, state, local and tribal government entities make available to it.”\n\nThe directive comes after the Air Force conceded it had never submitted the domestic-abuse conviction of Devin P. Kelley to the NICS database. Kelley purchased a Ruger AR-556 rifle with a 30-round magazine and used it to mow down a church full of parishioners in Sutherland Springs, Tex., earlier this month. It was the largest mass shooting in Texas history.\n\nAnd a month before that, a man using a “bump stock” to make his rifles fire at a much faster rate killed 58 people and injured hundreds more in Las Vegas. The Las Vegas sheriff said Stephen Paddock fired more than 1,100 rounds, according to the Associated Press. Investigators found 4,000 unused rounds in his hotel suite.\n\n[What it’s like to hear a shooting spree unfold two floors above your hotel room]\n\nGun-safety advocates routinely push for greater restrictions on gun purchases after such shootings.\n\n“As my colleagues go to sleep tonight, they need to think about whether the political support of the gun industry is worth the blood that flows endlessly onto the floors of American churches, elementary schools, movie theaters and city streets,” Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said after the Texas shooting.\n\nAnd gun-rights advocates routinely take equally strong stances on the other side of the issue.\n\nAfter the Newtown, Conn., shooting that left six educators and 20 children dead, the National Rifle Association described then-President Barack Obama’s gun-violence-reduction proposals as an effort to ban millions of guns.\n\n“The main goal of the gun banners in Congress is not to make schools safer, but to ban your guns and abolish every last sacred right you have under the Second Amendment . . . until they reduce your freedom to ashes,” the NRA said in an alert.\n\nBut consumers with strong opinions on guns don’t have to wait for the debate to play out. They can just take their wallets to gun stores — and routinely after mass shootings, they do.\n\nAs The Washington Post’s Sari Horwitz and Peter Finn reported, the United States experienced “a record run on military-style assault weapons” in 2013, especially in the months after the Newtown shootings.\n\nBut this year, one mass shooting was different. Even the NRA said there should be additional regulations on devices like Paddock’s bump stocks. Investigators should “identify any additional measures that should be taken to prevent firearms from being obtained by prohibited persons” the association’s memo says.\n\nMeanwhile, it appears the FBI will have to figure out how to deal with the onslaught of background checks.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the agency has “struggled to keep pace with the volume of firearm transactions and still properly maintain the databases of criminal and mental health records necessary to determine whether buyers are eligible to purchase guns.”\n\nLast year, when it processed some 27.5 million background checks, it had to bring in personnel from other units.\n\nRead more:\n\nKa-ching: Why this year’s top tech gifts cost about a grand\n\nA fire alarm from gun smoke led police to the shooter’s room, retired officer says\n\nAfter shootings, police fear being ‘a public target’ — even at lunch\n\nMan held by Taliban for five years thought his captors were joking about Trump being president","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/11/26/guns-were-black-friday-must-haves-going-by-the-fbis-record-203086-background-check-requests/","1511672400.0"

"Russia, in Reversal, Confirms Radiation Spike\nA weather station in the town of Argayash recorded ruthenium 106 levels that were 986 times higher than a month earlier, the state weather agency said. A second station at Novogorny detected levels 440 times higher. Ruthenium 106, which does not occur naturally and has a half-life of about a year, is used for medical purposes.\n\nFor weeks, Russian officials had denied the French and German accusations. Citing the results of its own air monitoring on European territory, Moscow pointed to high radiation levels over Romania, Italy and Ukraine, insisting that there had been only a negligible presence of ruthenium 106 on Russian territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, even after the Russian agency acknowledged the radiation spike in the Urals, Maxim Yakovenko, the head of Roshydromet, said in a statement that higher levels of contamination had been detected in Romania than in Russia. “The published data is not sufficient to establish the location of the pollution source,” he said.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Mayak was part of a string of closed military areas whose existence and function were supposed to be kept secret. The accident in 1957, which released radioactive waste, was kept under wraps for decades.\n\nThe authorities at Mayak denied in a news release on Tuesday that the plant had contributed to the increased levels of ruthenium 106 and insisted that there was no threat to human beings.\n\n“The dose which a person could be subjected to, according to the Roshydromet data, is 20,000 times lower than the safe yearly dose, and does not represent any danger whatsoever to people’s health or their lives,” the news release said.\n\nRosatom, the state company that runs Russia’s nuclear industry, said there had been no accidents at its plants that could explain the concentration of ruthenium 106. “Rosatom categorically confirms there have been no unreported accidents or reportable events on any of its nuclear sites,” the company said. “The highest concentrations are in areas outside Russia.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The nuclear authorities in Kazakhstan also denied responsibility for the pollution.\n\nThe vast Mayak facility once produced plutonium for Soviet nuclear weapons. In the 1957 breach, a nuclear waste storage tank exploded, sending a radioactive cloud over an area estimated at 20,000 square miles.\n\nThe accident is considered to be one of the worst on record after those at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. A further accident was reported at Mayak in 2004 when officials confirmed that waste had been dumped in a nearby river.\n\nThe memory of Mayak has fed skepticism among Russians about the state’s readiness to disclose what is really going on now. Some have taken to social media to voice their frustration. “1986 — silence over Chernobyl … 2017 — silence over Chelyabinsk,” a user named SivSA posted on Twitter.\n\nOfficials in the Mayak region said there were no plans to evacuate the region for now. “First we need to figure this all out,” the Chelyabinsk region’s vice governor, Sergey Sushkov, said.\n\nFor their part, Russian scientists have called for calm.\n\nIlia V. Yarmoshenko of the Institute of Industrial Ecology in Yekaterinburg, which monitors radiation in the Urals, said there was no cause for concern. Radiation levels in an average apartment in the South Urals are “10 times higher” than the levels recorded by Roshydromet, he told Znak.\n\nThe report by Roshydromet was compiled in September, but was released only on Tuesday in response to a request for information by Greenpeace. On Tuesday, Greenpeace said it would petition the Russian State Prosecutor’s office to investigate “a possible concealment of a radiation incident.”\n\nThe Mayak plant was also mentioned in inquiries into the poisoning death of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a KGB defector poisoned with radioactive polonium 210 in London in 2006. Norman Dombey, an emeritus professor of theoretical physics at the University of Sussex, told a public inquiry in 2015 that the polonium used to poison him could only have come from Russia because production had ceased in other places.\n\nProfessor Dombey said that polonium was produced at another plant, using bismuth irradiated at Mayak. In early 2016, the inquiry found that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had probably approved the Litvinenko poisoning.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/world/europe/russia-nuclear-cloud.html","1511240400.0"

"NASA will try again to create colorful clouds in the night sky\n(CNN) NASA is hoping for some better weather as it attempts to launch a much-anticipated rocket Thursday morning after scrubbing the launch too many times to count.\n\nThe rocket's launch has been delayed several times since May 31, with the last attempt, on June 24, foiled by extensive cloud cover. Previous attempts were scrubbed for various reasons, from strong winds and clouds to boats in the potential payload landing area.\n\nForecast for Eastern U.S. at 4:30 a.m. EDT on Thursay, June 129th. The shaded circle indicates the viewable region for colored clouds resulting from NASA's Sounding Rocket launch.\n\nThe rocket is set to launch from Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia's eastern shore. Thursday morning's forecast looks mostly clear for the launch area, but some clouds are forecast just to the north, which could obscure viewing of the colored clouds in the region near New York.\n\nNASA will need clear skies at one of its two viewing locations on the ground: the launch site on Wallops Island, Virginia, and in Duck, North Carolina.\n\nThe sounding rocket's payload is tested at the Wallops Flight Facility.\n\nFour to five minutes after launch, the sounding rocket is expected to deploy 10 canisters about the size of soft drink cans, each containing a colored vapor that forms artificial, luminescent clouds.\n\nThe clouds, or vapor tracers, are formed 'through the interaction of barium, strontium and cupric-oxide,' according to NASA.\n\nSince the canisters will be released about 100 miles (160 kilometers) above the ground, the space agency says they 'pose absolutely no hazard to residents along the mid-Atlantic coast.'\n\nVapor tracers to put on a show\n\nThe vapor tracers will allow scientists on the ground to view the movement of the particles in the ionosphere, a part of Earth's atmosphere that stretches to the edge of space, to learn more about the movement of the air currents at that altitude.\n\nThe whole mission will last about eight minutes before the payload lands in the Atlantic Ocean, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) out to sea from its launch point in Virginia.\n\n'The vapor tracers could be visible from New York to North Carolina and westward to Charlottesville, Virginia,' NASA said.\n\nVapor tracers could be visible from New York to North Carolina and west to Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIf you're near the US East Coast, start looking toward the eastern horizon about five minutes after launch. The farther you are from the launch location, the lower the clouds will appear on the horizon.\n\nIf you are north of the launch site -- say, in Washington, Philadelphia or New York -- the clouds will appear in the lower southeastern sky. If you are to the south -- in Norfolk, Virginia Beach or the Outer Banks of North Carolina -- look toward the northeastern horizon.

"Middle East on edge after Trump's 'dangerous' Jerusalem move\nThe powerful Palestinian Islamist group Hamas called for a new intifada — or uprising — against Israel while a prominent Iraqi militia Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba said Trump’s “stupid decision” could become a 'legitimate reason' to attack U.S. forces in Iraq.\n\nAmerican flags were burned at protests outside the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul and in Cairo and Gaza City late Wednesday, while Iraq on Thursday summoned the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad over the issue.\n\nThe State Department updated its “worldwide caution” advice late Wednesday and sent an internal cable deferring nonessential travel to Israel, Jerusalem and the West Bank through Dec. 20, officials told NBC News.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Jordan said that it had 'temporarily suspended routine public services' and that 'all embassy travel outside Amman, both official and personal, has been prohibited until further notice.'\n\nIn the Baqaa refugee camp on Amman's outskirts, hundreds of Palestinians roamed the streets overnight, denouncing Trump and urging Jordan to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel. 'Down with America ... America is the mother of terror,' they chanted.\n\nIsrael’s security force, the IDF, sent reinforcements to the West Bank as part of “readiness to possible developments” in response to the decision.\n\nTurkey said America had dropped a grenade in the Middle East. 'The United States has pulled the pin on a bomb ready to blow in the region,' Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told a conference in Ankara.\n\nTalk of a new uprising (intifada) after Trump’s statement on Jerusalem. Palestinians say peace process hasn’t worked. pic.twitter.com/BvXcmiEP3D — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) December 7, 2017\n\nTrump's announcement also put in motion a move of the U.S. embassy to the holy city from Tel Aviv — a process that aides have said could take years. It marked follow-through by Trump on a major campaign promise he'd made that had been closely followed by Israel and by evangelical Christians in the U.S.\n\nAhead of the announcement, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had voiced concerns about the threat it would create for American personnel in the region.\n\nRelated: Trump's Jerusalem move undermines U.S. interests, analysts say\n\nSince the 1979 Camp David Accords, U.S. presidents have refused to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or move the U.S. embassy. The U.S. approach has been that Jerusalem's status should be negotiated between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nProtesters chant against America outside the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul on Wednesday night. OZAN KOSE / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe Palestinians have sought the city's eastern sector, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of a future independent state. They fear Trump's declaration essentially imposes on them a disastrous solution for one of the core issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nU.S. ally Saudi Arabia joined the chorus of concern Thursday, saying it followed Trump’s decision 'with deep sorrow' and warned of 'dangerous consequences.”\n\nLebanese militant group Hezbollah said the move closed all paths to negotiations. Hassan Fadlallah, spokesman for the group's lawmakers, said the only way for Arabs to restore their rights was now through armed 'resistance.'\n\nTillerson defended Trump's move, saying it reflected a longstanding reality. Speaking on the sidelines of an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe conference in Vienna, he said the U.S. would still support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 'if that's the desire of the two parties.'\n\nThere were also anti-U.S. rallies in Muslim-majority Pakistan on Thursday, including in the cities of Islamabad and Peshawar.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-jerusalem-uproar-middle-east-braces-violent-protests-n827301","None"
"Massive government recall covers 37.8M Kidde fire extinguishers\nThe federal government is launching a massive fire extinguisher recall. It covers nearly 40 million Kidde extinguishers. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says 37.8 million fire extinguishers might not work during an emergency.\n\nKidde marketing videos emphasize how important their products are in the event of a fire, but the company is now recalling 37.8 million of its fire extinguishers in the United States, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave. The recalled extinguishers date back decades and some models have been recalled before for other issues.\n\nAnn Marie Buerkle leads the agency ordering the recall.\n\n'It's a product that a lot of people have in their homes, in their offices,' Buerkle said.\n\nThe agency claims extinguishers with plastic handles and push button -- or pindicators -- can clog, resulting in a failure to discharge. Nozzles can also pop off with enough force to be a dangerous projectile.\n\nThere have been nearly 400 reports of extinguishers malfunctioning resulting in 16 injuries and one death.\n\n'You're better off to have no fire extinguisher than a defective fire extinguisher,' said former California chief fire marshal James McMullen.\n\nMcMullen says Kidde's huge market share makes the recall worrisome.\n\n'If you attack a fire thinking you're going to put it out with a defective fire extinguisher and it doesn't work you put yourself in harm's way,' McMullen said.\n\nIn 2014, Brendan Rosko died in a Pennsylvania car crash after an extinguisher used by first responders malfunctioned. His family received a settlement from Kidde.\n\nIn response to the recall, Kidde said in a statement that 'customer safety is our first priority' and that it working with authorities to 'ensure that affected fire extinguishers are replaced as quickly as possible.'\n\n'Get a new fire extinguisher free of charge in your home and have that certainty that it will work,' Buerkle said.\n\nKidde will replace defective extinguishers for free with new ones made with metal parts.

"Migrants from west Africa being ‘sold in Libyan slave markets’\nUN migration agency says selling of people is rife in African nation that has slid into violent chaos since overthrow of Gaddafi\n\nWest African migrants are being bought and sold openly in modern-day slave markets in Libya, survivors have told a UN agency helping them return home.\n\nTrafficked people passing through Libya have previously reported violence, extortion and slave labour. But the new testimony from the International Organization for Migration suggests that the trade in human beings has become so normalised that people are being traded in public.\n\n“The latest reports of ‘slave markets’ for migrants can be added to a long list of outrages [in Libya],” said Mohammed Abdiker, IOM’s head of operation and emergencies. “The situation is dire. The more IOM engages inside Libya, the more we learn that it is a vale of tears for all too many migrants.”\n\n'They were psychopaths': how chaos in Libya fuels the migration crisis Read more\n\nThe north African nation is a major exit point for refugees from Africa trying to take boats to Europe. But since the overthrow of autocratic leader Muammar Gaddafi, the vast, sparsely populated country has slid into violent chaos and migrants with little cash and usually no papers are particularly vulnerable.\n\nOne 34-year-old survivor from Senegal said he was taken to a dusty lot in the south Libyan city of Sabha after crossing the desert from Niger in a bus organised by people smugglers. The group had paid to be taken to the coast, where they planned to risk a boat trip to Europe, but their driver suddenly said middlemen had not passed on his fees and put his passengers up for sale.\n\n“The men on the pick-up were brought to a square, or parking lot, where a kind of slave trade was happening. There were locals – he described them as Arabs – buying sub-Saharan migrants,” said Livia Manante, an IOM officer based in Niger who helps people wanting to return home.\n\nShe interviewed the survivor after he escaped from Libya earlier this month and said accounts of slave markets were confirmed by other migrants she spoke to in Niger and some who had been interviewed by colleagues in Europe.\n\n“Several other migrants confirmed his story, independently describing kinds of slave markets as well as kinds of private prisons all over in Libya,” Manente said. “IOM Italy has confirmed that this story is similar to many stories reported by migrants and collected at landing points in southern Italy, including the slave market reports. This gives more evidence that the stories reported are true, as the stories of those who managed to cross-match those who are returning back to their countries.”\n\nAfter his sale, the Senegalese migrant was taken to a makeshift prison of a kind that has been well documented in Libya. Those held inside are forced to work without pay, or on meagre rations, and their captors regularly call family at home demanding a ransom. His captors asked for 300,000 west African francs (about £380), then sold him on to a larger jail where the demand doubled without explanation.\n\nMen who lingered there too long without the ransom being paid were taken away and killed, he said. Some wasted away on meagre rations in unsanitary conditions, dying of hunger and disease, but overall numbers never fell. “If the number of migrants goes down, because of death or someone is ransomed, the kidnappers just go to the market and buy one,” Manente said.\n\nHis terrified family began scraping together loans. As he spoke fluent English, French and some local languages, he translated for his jailers to win time for relatives to collect the money.\n\nMany other migrants flee Libya with similar stories, said Giuseppe Loprete, chief of mission at IOM Niger. “Its very clear they see themselves as being treated as slaves,” he said.\n\nLoprete’s office has arranged for the repatriation of 1,500 people in the first three months of this year – almost the same number as in the whole of 2015. He fears more horrors are likely to emerge.\n\nBodies of dozens of people wash ashore in western Libya Read more\n\n“There are now more migrants coming back from Libya, so that’s also why all these stories are coming to the surface,” he said. “And conditions are worsening in Libya so I think we can also expect more in the coming months.”\n\nEven growing international awareness of the problems migrants face is being exploited. IOM has had credible reports of criminals posing as aid groups that help migrants to lure in people who have escaped or bought their freedom and want to return home.\n\nThe organisation is working to spread awareness across west Africa of the horrors of the journey through the personal stories of those who return. Though most migrants know the boat trips to Europe are extremely risky, fewer realise they may face even worse dangers in Libya before even reaching the coast.\n\n“Tragically, the most credible messengers are migrants returning home with IOM help,” said spokesman Leonard Doyle. “Too often they are broken, brutalised and have been abused. Their voices carry more weight than anyone else’s.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration","1491796800.0"
"Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals\nImage copyright Reuters/EPA Image caption Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (L) and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran are at loggerheads. They have long been rivals, but it's all recently got a lot more tense. Here's why.\n\nHow come Saudi Arabia and Iran don't get along?\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran - two powerful neighbours - are locked in a fierce struggle for regional dominance.\n\nThe decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main sects in Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power.\n\nThis religious schism is reflected in the wider map of the Middle East, where other countries have Sunni or Shia majorities, some of whom look towards Iran or Saudi Arabia for support or guidance.\n\nHistorically Saudi Arabia, a monarchy and home to the birthplace of Islam, saw itself as the leader of the Muslim world. However this was challenged in 1979 by the Islamic revolution in Iran which created a new type of state in the region - a kind of theocracy - that had an explicit goal of exporting this model beyond its own borders.\n\nIn the past 15 years in particular, the differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran have been sharpened by a series of events.\n\nThe 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq overthrew Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab who had been a major Iranian adversary. This removed a crucial military counter-weight to Iranian influence in Iraq, which has been rising since then.\n\nFast-forward to 2011 and uprisings across the Arab world caused political instability throughout the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia exploited these upheavals to expand their influence, notably in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, further heightening mutual suspicions.\n\nIran's critics say it is intent on establishing itself or its proxies across the region, and achieve control of a land corridor stretching from Iran to the Mediterranean.\n\nHow have things suddenly got worse?\n\nThe strategic rivalry is heating up because Iran is in many ways winning the regional struggle.\n\nIn Syria, Iranian (and Russian) support for President Bashar al-Assad has largely routed rebel group groups backed by Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia is trying desperately to contain rising Iranian influence and the militaristic adventurism of the kingdom's young and impulsive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - the country's de facto ruler - is exacerbating regional tensions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five things about Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\n\nHe is waging a war against rebels in Saudi Arabia's southern neighbour, Yemen, in part to stem perceived Iranian influence there, but after nearly three years this is proving a costly gamble.\n\nMeanwhile in Lebanon, many observers believe the Saudis put pressure on the prime minister to resign in order to destabilise a country where Iran's ally, Shia militia group Hezbollah, leads a politically powerful bloc and controls a huge, heavily armed fighting force.\n\nThere are also external forces at play. Saudi Arabia has been emboldened by support from the Trump administration while Israel, which sees Iran as a mortal threat, is in a sense 'backing' the Saudi effort to contain Iran.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nThe Jewish state is fearful of the encroachment of pro-Iranian fighters in Syria ever closer to its border.\n\nIsrael and Saudi Arabia were the two countries most resolutely opposed to the 2015 international agreement limiting Iran's nuclear programme, insisting that it did not go far enough to roll back any chance of Iran obtaining the bomb.\n\nWho are their regional allies?\n\nBroadly speaking the strategic map of the Middle East reflects the Shia-Sunni divide.\n\nIn the pro-Saudi camp are the other major Sunni actors in the Gulf - the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain, as well as Egypt and Jordan.\n\nIn the Iranian camp is Syria's government, which has been strongly backed by Iran, and where pro-Iranian Shia militia groups, including the Lebanon-based Hezbollah, have played a prominent role in fighting predominantly Sunni rebel groups.\n\nThe Shia-dominated Iraqi government is also a close ally of Iran, though paradoxically it also retains a close relationship with Washington on whom it has depended for help in the struggle against so-called Islamic State.\n\nHow is the Saudi-Iranian rivalry being played out?\n\nThis is in many ways a regional equivalent of the Cold War, which pitted the US against the Soviet Union in a tense military standoff for many years.\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia are not directly fighting but they are engaged in a variety of proxy wars around the region.\n\nSyria is an obvious example while in Yemen Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of supplying ballistic missiles fired at Saudi territory by the Shia Houthi rebel movement - an incident which heightened the war of words between the two countries.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Yemen is one of a number of battlegrounds fuelling Iranian-Saudi tensions\n\nBut having become bogged down in Yemen and essentially defeated in Syria, Saudi Arabia seems to have its eye on Lebanon as the next proxy battlefield.\n\nLebanon risks being tipped into Syria-like chaos but few analysts see Saudi interests prevailing there.\n\nConflict in Lebanon could so easily draw in Israel in opposition to Hezbollah and this could lead to a third Israel-Lebanon war far more devastating than any of the previous encounters.\n\nSome cynics wonder if the Saudi crown prince's game plan is to trigger a war between Israel and Hezbollah and deliver a heavy blow to the group this way!\n\nAre we heading towards a direct war between Saudi Arabia and Iran?\n\nSo far Tehran and Riyadh have fought via proxies. Neither is really geared up for a direct war with the other but one successful rocket attack on the Saudi capital from Yemen could upset the apple cart.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Will Saudi Arabia go to war with Iran?\n\nOne obvious area where they could come into direct conflict is in the waters of the Gulf, where they face each other across a maritime border.\n\nBut here too fighting could risk a much broader conflict. For the US and other Western powers, freedom of navigation in the Gulf is essential and any conflict that sought to block the waterway - vital for international shipping and oil transportation - could easily draw in US naval and air forces.\n\nFor a long time the US and its allies have seen Iran as a destabilising force in the Middle East. The Saudi leadership increasingly sees Iran as an existential threat and the crown prince seems willing to take whatever action he sees necessary, wherever he deems it necessary, to confront Tehran's rising influence.\n\nThe danger is that Saudi Arabia's new activism is fast making it a further source of volatility in the region.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42008809","None"
"Full Video and Transcript: Trump’s Speech Recognizing Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel\nMy announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIn 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act urging the federal government to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city, and so importantly, is Israel’s capital. This act passed congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. And was reaffirmed by unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.\n\nYet, for over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law’s waiver, refusing to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem or to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital city. Presidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. Some say they lacked courage but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time. Nevertheless, the record is in.\n\nAfter more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIt would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.\n\nTherefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\n\nWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver.\n\nToday, I am delivering. I’ve judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a long overdue step to advance the peace process. And to work towards a lasting agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIsrael is a sovereign nation with the right, like every other sovereign nation, to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this is a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace. It was 70 years ago that the United States under President Truman recognized the state of Israel.\n\nEver since then, Israel has made its capital in the city of Jerusalem, the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times.\n\nToday, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli Supreme Court. It is the location of the official residence of the prime minister and the president. It is the headquarters of many government ministries.\n\nFor decades, visiting American presidents, secretaries of State and military leaders have met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem, as I did on my trip to Israel earlier this year.\n\nJerusalem is not just the heart of three great religions, but it is now also the heart of one of the most successful democracies in the world. Over the past seven decades, the Israeli people have by the a country where Jews, Muslims and Christians and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience and according to their beliefs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nJerusalem is today and must remain a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the stations of the cross, and where Muslims worship at Al Aqsa Mosque. However, through all of these years, presidents representing the United States have declined to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In fact, we have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital at all.\n\nBut today we finally acknowledge the obvious. That Jerusalem is Israel’s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It’s something that has to be done.\n\nThat is why consistent with the Jerusalem embassy act, I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers and planners so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace.\n\nIn making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear. This decision is not intended in any way to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. We are not taking a position of any final status issues including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved.\n\nThe United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides. I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement.\n\nWithout question, Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in those talks. The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. In the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem’s holy sites including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif. Above all, our greatest hope is for peace. The universal yearning in every human soul.\n\nWith today’s action, I reaffirm my administration’s longstanding commitment to a future of peace and security for the region. There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and a place far greater in understanding and cooperation. This sacred city should call forth the best in humanity.\n\nLifting our sights to what is possible, not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable.\n\nPeace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach it.\n\nSo today we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate. Our children should inherit our love, not our conflicts. I repeat the message I delivered at the historic and extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia earlier this year: The Middle East is a region rich with culture, spirit, and history. Its people are brilliant, proud and diverse. Vibrant and strong.\n\nBut the incredible future awaiting this region is held at bay by bloodshed, ignorance and terror.\n\nVice President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations.\n\nIt is time for the many who desire peace to expel the extremists from their midsts. It is time for all civilized nations and people to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate, not violence. And it is time for young and moderate voices all across the Middle East to claim for themselves a bright and beautiful future.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo today, let us rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect. Let us rethink old assumptions and open our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities.\n\nAnd finally, I ask the leaders of the region political and religious, Israeli and Palestinian, Jewish and Christian and Muslim to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace.\n\nThank you. God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the Palestinians and God bless the United States.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-israel-speech-transcript.html","1512536400.0"
"Massive butterfly migration seen on radar\nOn their radar, National Weather Service meteorologists in Boulder could see it coming.\n\nThey just weren’t sure what “it” was. The mysterious red and purple blobs began appearing on radar screens, stretching at least 100 miles across the Denver area.\n\n“The radar started to light up right after sunrise and that whole mass just started to move over Denver, all flying in the same direction, kind of floating with the light winds that day,” Paul Schlatter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder, told ABC News.\n\nThinking it might be migrating birds, the weather service tweeted out a radar animation of what they were seeing, asking bird experts for advice.\n\nLook at what's flying into Denver!

Today, the butterflies are staying close to the ground. #cowx #Science pic.twitter.com/rkpwmPRnsi — NWS Boulder (@NWSBoulder) October 4, 2017\n\n“It needed to be a lot of butterflies in the area for sure to generate that much of a signal. Especially across that broad an area,” Schlatter said.\n\nSchlatter said that while NWS meteorologists are used to seeing birds on their radar, butterflies and insects are relatively rare.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/AP\n\nThe orange-and-black butterflies, which are known as painted ladies, were passing through Colorado on their annual migration south before the winter months.\n\nSchlatter said the flock of butterflies appeared to be at least 100 miles wide, noting that radar may not have picked up the entire mass migration because its signal eventually drops off due to the curvature of the earth.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/P\n\nLepidopterist Sarah Garrett with the Butterfly Pavilion in Westminster, Colorado, says there are two competing explanations for the population boom.\n\nThe butterflies are either in the process of migrating from colder climates in the north to places like Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico, she says. Or, she says they might just be moving from higher mountain elevations down into the Denver area.\n\n“In either case, what they’re doing is following their food source,” Garrett tells ABC.\n\nThe butterflies also got a boost this past spring. Warm temperatures arrived early in the season, and lots of rainfall helped feed the flowery plants butterflies seek.\n\n“More plants mean more caterpillars,” Garrett said. “So they got a head start. They started reproducing much earlier than normal.”\n\nGarrett says she’s seen radar images capturing butterflies before, but never before in Denver.\n\n“To me this is super-cool, but to see other people get excited about it is really what makes it for me,” she said.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/massive-butterfly-migration-radar/story?id=50308996","None"

What you do is you make it so when someone pulls a lever, sometimes they get a reward, an exciting reward. And it turns out that this design technique can be embedded inside of all these products.\n\nThe rewards Harris is talking about are a big part of what makes smartphones so appealing. The chance of getting likes on Facebook and Instagram. Cute emojis in text messages. And new followers on Twitter.\n\nTristan Harris: There’s a whole playbook of techniques that get used to get you using the product for as long as possible.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What kind of techniques are used?\n\n“...every time I check my phone, I’m playing the slot machine to see, ‘What did I get?’ This is one way to hijack people’s minds and create a habit, to form a habit.” Tristan Harris\n\nTristan Harris: Tristan Harris: So Snapchat’s the most popular messaging service for teenagers. And they invented this feature called “streaks,” which shows the number of days in a row that you’ve sent a message back and forth with someone. So now you could say, “Well, what’s the big deal here?” Well, the problem is that kids feel like, “Well, now I don’t want to lose my streak.” But it turns out that kids actually when they go on vacation are so stressed about their streak that they actually give their password to, like, five other kids to keep their streaks going on their behalf. And so you could ask when these features are being designed, are they designed to most help people live their life? Or are they being designed because they’re best at hooking people into using the product?\n\nAnderson Cooper: Is Silicon Valley programming apps or are they programming people?\n\nTristan Harris: Inadvertently, whether they want to or not, they are shaping the thoughts and feelings and actions of people. They are programming people. There’s always this narrative that technology’s neutral. And it’s up to us to choose how we use it. This is just not true.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Technology’s not neutral?\n\nTristan Harris: It’s not neutral. They want you to use it in particular ways and for long periods of time. Because that’s how they make their money.\n\nIt’s rare for a tech insider to be so blunt, but Tristan Harris believes someone needs to be. A few years ago he was living the Silicon Valley dream. He dropped out of a master’s program at Stanford University to start a software company. Four years later Google bought him out and hired him as a product manager. It was while working there he started to feel overwhelmed.\n\nTristan Harris: Honestly, I was just bombarded in email and calendar invitations and just the overload of what it’s like to work at a place like Google. And I was asking, “When is all of this adding up to, like, an actual benefit to my life?” And I ended up making this presentation. It was kind of a manifesto. And it basically said, you know, “Look, never before in history have a handful of people at a handful of technology companies shaped how a billion people think and feel every day with the choices they make about these screens.”\n\n“Inadvertently, whether they want to or not, they are shaping the thoughts and feelings and actions of people. They are programming people.” Tristan Harris\n\nHis 144-page presentation argued that the constant distractions of apps and emails are “weakening our relationships to each other,” and “destroying our kids ability to focus.” It was widely read inside Google, and caught the eye of one of the founders Larry Page. But Harris told us it didn’t lead to any changes and after three years he quit.\n\nTristan Harris: And it’s not because anyone is evil or has bad intentions. It’s because the game is getting attention at all costs. And the problem is it becomes this race to the bottom of the brainstem, where if I go lower on the brainstem to get you, you know, using my product, I win. But it doesn’t end up in the world we want to live in. We don’t end up feeling good about how we’re using all this stuff.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You call this a “race to the bottom of the brain stem.” It’s a race to the most primitive emotions we have? Fear, anxiety, loneliness, all these things?\n\nTristan Harris: Absolutely. And that’s again because in the race for attention I have to do whatever works.\n\nTristan Harris: It absolutely wants one thing, which is your attention.\n\nNow he travels the country trying to convince programmers and anyone else who will listen that the business model of tech companies needs to change. He wants products designed to make the best use of our time not just grab our attention.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Do you think parents understand the complexities of what their kids are dealing with, when they’re dealing with their phone, dealing with apps and social media?\n\nTristan Harris: No. And I think this is really important. Because there’s a narrative that, “Oh, I guess they’re just doing this like we used to gossip on the phone, but what this misses is that your telephone in the 1970s didn’t have a thousand engineers on the other side of the telephone who were redesigning it to work with other telephones and then updating the way your telephone worked every day to be more and more persuasive. That was not true in the 1970s.\n\nAnderson Cooper: How many Silicon Valley insiders are there speaking out like you are?\n\nTristan Harris: Not that many.\n\nWe reached out to the biggest tech firms but none would speak on the record and some didn’t even return our phone call. Most tech companies say their priority is improving user experience, something they call “engagement.” But they remain secretive about what they do to keep people glued to their screens. So we went to Venice, California, where the body builders on the beach are being muscled out by small companies that specialize in what Ramsay Brown calls “brain hacking.”\n\nCBS News\n\nRamsay Brown: A computer programmer who now understands how the brain works knows how to write code that will get the brain to do certain things.\n\nRamsay Brown studied neuroscience before co-founding Dopamine Labs, a start-up crammed into a garage. The company is named after the dopamine molecule in our brains that aids in the creation of desire and pleasure. Brown and his colleagues write computer code for apps used by fitness companies and financial firms. The programs are designed to provoke a neurological response.\n\n“A computer programmer who now understands how the brain works knows how to write code that will get the brain to do certain things.” Ramsay Brown\n\nAnderson Cooper: You’re trying to figure out how to get people coming back to use the screen?\n\nRamsay Brown: When should I make you feel a little extra awesome to get you to come back into the app longer?\n\nCBS News\n\nThe computer code he creates finds the best moment to give you one of those rewards, which have no actual value, but Brown says trigger your brain to make you want more. For example, on Instagram, he told us sometimes those likes come in a sudden rush.\n\nRamsay Brown: They’re holding some of them back for you to let you know later in a big burst. Like, hey, here’s the 30 likes we didn’t mention from a little while ago. Why that moment--\n\nAnderson Cooper: So all of a sudden you get a big burst of likes?\n\nRamsay Brown: Yeah, but why that moment? There’s some algorithm somewhere that predicted, hey, for this user right now who is experimental subject 79B3 in experiment 231, we think we can see an improvement in his behavior if you give it to him in this burst instead of that burst.\n\nWhen Brown says “experiments,” he’s talking generally about the millions of computer calculations being used every moment by his company and others use to constantly tweak your online experience and make you come back for more.\n\nRamsay Brown: You’re part of a controlled set of experiments that are happening in real time across you and millions of other people.\n\nAnderson Cooper: We’re guinea pigs?\n\nRamsay Brown: You’re guinea pigs. You are guinea pigs in the box pushing the button and sometimes getting the likes. And they’re doing this to keep you in there.\n\nThe longer we look at our screens, the more data companies collect about us, and the more ads we see. Ad spending on social media has doubled in just two years to more than $31 billion.\n\nRamsay Brown: You don’t pay for Facebook. Advertisers pay for Facebook. You get to use it for free because your eyeballs are what’s being sold there.\n\nAnderson Cooper: That’s an interesting way to look at it, that you’re not the customer for Facebook.\n\n“You don’t pay for Facebook. Advertisers pay for Facebook. You get to use it for free because your eyeballs are what’s being sold there.” Ramsay Brown\n\nRamsay Brown: You’re not the customer. You don’t sign a check to Facebook. But Coca-Cola does.\n\nBrown says there’s a reason texts and Facebook use a continuous scroll, because it’s a proven way to keep you searching longer.\n\nRamsay Brown: You spend half your time on Facebook just scrolling to find one good piece worth looking at. It’s happening because they are engineered to become addictive.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You’re almost saying it like there’s an addiction code.\n\nRamsay Brown: Yeah, that is the case. That since we’ve figured out, to some extent, how these pieces of the brain that handle addiction are working, people have figured out how to juice them further and how to bake that information into apps.\n\nLarry Rosen: Dinner table could be a technology-free zone.\n\nWhile Brown is tapping into the power of dopamine, psychologist Larry Rosen and his team at California State University Dominguez Hills are researching the effect technology has on our anxiety levels.\n\nLarry Rosen: We’re looking at the impact of technology through the brain.\n\nRosen told us when you put your phone down – your brain signals your adrenal gland to produce a burst of a hormone called, cortisol, which has an evolutionary purpose. Cortisol triggers a fight-or-flight response to danger.\n\nAnderson Cooper: How does cortisol relate to a mobile device, a phone?\n\nLarry Rosen: What we find is the typical person checks their phone every 15 minutes or less and half of the time they check their phone there is no alert, no notification. It’s coming from inside their head telling them, “Gee, I haven’t check in Facebook in a while. I haven’t checked on this Twitter feed for a while. I wonder if somebody commented on my Instagram post.” That then generates cortisol and it starts to make you anxious. And eventually your goal is to get rid of that anxiety so you check in.\n\nSo the same hormone that made primitive man anxious and hyperaware of his surroundings to keep him from being eaten by lions is today compelling Rosen’s students and all of us to continually peek at our phones to relieve our anxiety.\n\nLarry Rosen: When you put the phone down you don’t shut off your brain, you just put the phone down.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Can I be honest with you right now? I haven’t paid attention to what you’re saying because I just realized my phone is right down by my right foot and I haven’t checked it in, like 10 minutes.\n\nLarry Rosen: And it makes you anxious.\n\nAnderson Cooper: I’m a little anxious.\n\nCBS News\n\nLarry Rosen: Yes.\n\nWe found out just how anxious in this experiment conducted by Rosen’s research colleague Nancy Cheever.\n\nNancy Cheever: So the first thing I’m going to do is apply these electrodes to your fingers.\n\nWhile I watched a video, a computer tracked minute changes in my heart rate and perspiration. What I didn’t know was that Cheever was sending text messages to my phone which was just out of reach. Every time my text notification went off, the blue line spiked – indicating anxiety caused in part by the release of cortisol.\n\nNancy Cheever: Oh, that one is…that’s a huge spike right there. And if you can imagine what that’s doing to your body. Every time you get a text message you probably can’t even feel it right? Because it’s such a um, it’s a small amount of arousal.\n\nAnderson Cooper: That’s fascinating.\n\nTheir research suggests our phones are keeping us in a continual state of anxiety in which the only antidote – is the phone.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Is it known what the impact of all this technology use is?\n\nLarry Rosen: Absolutely not.\n\nAnderson Cooper: It’s too soon.\n\nLarry Rosen: We’re all part of this big experiment.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What is this doing to a young mind or a teenager?\n\nLarry Rosen: Well there’s some projects going on where they’re actually scanning teenager’s brains over a 20-year period and looking to see what kind of changes they’re finding.\n\nCBS News\n\nGabe Zichermann: Here’s the reality. Corporations and creators of content have, since the beginning of time, wanted to make their content as engaging as possible.\n\nGabe Zichermann has worked with dozens of companies – including Apple and CBS – to make their online products more irresistible. He’s best known in Silicon Valley for his expertise in something called “gamification,” using techniques from video games to insert fun and competition into almost everything on your smartphone.\n\nGabe Zichermann: So one of the interesting things about gamification and other engaging technologies, is at the same time as we can argue that the neuroscience is being used to create dependent behavior those same techniques are being used to get people to work out, you know, using their Fitbit. So all of these technologies, all the techniques for engagement can be used for good, or can be used for bad.\n\n“Asking technology companies, asking content creators to be less good at what they do feels like a ridiculous ask.” Gabe Zichermann\n\nZichermann is now working on software called ‘Onward’ designed to break user’s bad habits. It will track a person’s activity and can recommend they do something else when they’re spending too much time online.\n\nGabe Zichermann: I think creators have to be liberated to make their content as good as possible.\n\nAnderson Cooper: The idea that a tech company is not going to try to make their product as persuasive, as engaging as possible, you’re just saying that’s not gonna happen?\n\nGabe Zichermann: Asking technology companies, asking content creators to be less good at what they do feels like a ridiculous ask. It feels impossible. And also it’s very anti-capitalistic, this isn’t the system that we live in.\n\nRamsay Brown and his garage start-up Dopamine Labs made a habit-breaking app as well. It’s called “Space” and it creates a 12-second delay -- what Brown calls a “moment of Zen” before any social media app launches. In January, he tried to convince Apple to sell it in their App Store.\n\nRamsay Brown: And they rejected it from the App Store because they told us any app that would encourage people to use other apps or their iPhone less was unacceptable for distribution in the App Store.\n\nAnderson Cooper: They actually said that to you?\n\nRamsay Brown: They said that to us. They did not want us to give out this thing that was gonna make people less stuck on their phones.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brain-hacking-tech-insiders-60-minutes/","None"
"North Korea: Experts Warn Only Way Forward May Be Diplomacy\nHowever, a more subtle melody can be hear underneath these drums of war. Pence said Tuesday that the U.S. was working with allies to 'achieve a peaceable resolution' to the impasse.\n\n'With diplomatic and economic pressure we have a chance to achieve our objective of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula,' the vice president said in Japan.\n\nTrump also appeared to soften his language, telling Wisconsin's WTMJ radio that 'hopefully [Kim] wants peace.'\n\nSome analysts say this may be Trump's only realistic option for solving the crisis.\n\n'The situation is extraordinarily complicated and not amenable to either simple solutions or one-off ad-hoc interventions designed to demonstrate American strength,' said Professor Hazel Smith at London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).\n\nKim could easily launch a retaliatory strike against Seoul, the South Korean capital of 10 million people that sits 25 miles from the North Korean border, analysts point out.\n\nKim would only need the conventional missiles already in his arsenal, rather than nuclear weapons, to kill thousands. Parts of Japan may also be within range.\n\n'There is no certainty that the U.S. knows the whereabouts of all North Korea’s launch sites, and any attack would lead to a devastating retaliatory strike on Seoul,' Fraser Cameron, director of the Belgium-based EU-Asia Center, wrote in the Financial Times earlier this month.\n\nHe said there was 'no military solution to the problem of Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons.'\n\nNorth Korea is estimated to have at least eight nuclear weapons but not yet the means to miniaturize them in a long-range missile capable of hitting the U.S.\n\nEmbarking on a conflict with North Korea would also come with other challenges.\n\nML Cavanaugh, a U.S. Army strategist writing for the Modern War Institute at West Point, warned of North Korea's 'Afghanistan-like geography' that could allow its army to act like 'a much better-trained, much better-armed version of the Taliban.'\n\nFor all Trump's talk of ripping up the rule book, his softening approach is familiar to students of history.\n\n'This administration is following a well-worn pattern traced by every other U.S. administration from Clinton onward,' said Smith at SOAS. 'All new administrations blame previous administrations for being too weak or incompetent to solve the Korean crisis.'","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-experts-warn-only-way-forward-may-be-diplomacy-n748186","None"
"Catalan independence vote caps 400 years of mistrust\n(CNN) The tensions laid bare between Catalonia and Spain's federal government over Sunday's referendum have a long and painful history that reaches back to the Franco era and beyond. But never since Spain became a democracy have relations been this polarized, the language so inflammatory.\n\nOn Sunday night, the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, accused Catalan secessionists of 'indoctrinating children, harassing judges and journalists.' Barcelona's mayor tweeted that 'a cowardly president filled our city with police.'\n\nWhile Catalans were occupying schools to ensure they could open as polling stations, Spanish flags were suddenly hanging from balconies in faraway Andalucia. Jose Luis Nantunez, a retired jeweler in Cordoba, told CNN that the Catalans were 'rancourous traitors, indoctrinated at an early age to become nationalists.'\n\nThe brief moment of solidarity after the August terror attack in Barcelona, when King Felipe and Rajoy were applauded at a memorial in the Plaza Catalunya , seems a long time ago.\n\nEven then, the sniping resumed within days, with Catalan police complaining that Madrid had deprived them of intelligence from Europol, the pan-European law enforcement agency. The Spanish Interior Minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, said that such information could only be shared 'in an atmosphere of agreement and trust.'\n\nCenturies of mistrust\n\nPeople hold Catalan flags as they listen to Catalan President Carles Puigdemont speak as they await the referendum result.\n\nTrust has often been in short supply since King Felipe V's army captured Barcelona in 1714, an event still remembered every September 11, Catalonia's national day. As Barcelona became Spain's industrial powerhouse in the early 20th century, separatist sentiment stirred again. It contributed to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; General Francisco Franco's planes bombed Barcelona in 1938 and his forces took the city early in 1939.\n\nBarcelona began removing the last plaques from the Franco era this year; street names recalling his rule were changed long ago. But nearly four decades of military dictatorship still provoke a visceral reaction among older Catalans.\n\nFranco banned the use of the Catalan language in public -- yet today it's spoken by at least four million people, and taught as the primary language in every school. Culturally, economically and not least on the football field, Catalans see themselves as a distinct nation. The yellow-and-red striped flag is everywhere.\n\nThe seeds of the current crisis were perhaps sown when Spain adopted a democratic constitution in 1978. It devolved powers to the regions precisely as an insurance against a repeat of Franco's overweening central power, while stressing the 'indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation.'\n\nBut Catalan governments always wanted more, and support for outright independence reached a peak during the country's economic crisis from 2008 to 2012.\n\nIndependence supporters gather in Barcelona's main square on Sunday.\n\nCatalonia is the economic engine of Spain; its economy is the size of Portugal's. For years it has complained that its revenues are 'plundered: by Madrid -- that it pays in some $12 billion more than it receives. Madrid says the gap is much smaller -- a view supported by most economic analysis. Charles Powell, history professor at the Universidad CEU-San Pablo, says the Catalan calculation is 'nonsense' but the region receives less investment than its size would warrant.\n\nCatalan self-confidence\n\nSome 20 years ago, I spoke with the then mayor of Barcelona, Pasqual Maragall. The city was basking in the glow of a successful Olympic Games, for which it had transformed much of Barcelona's infrastructure. I asked him how relations were with Madrid. There was a shrug. Barcelona saw itself more as a European city, he said.\n\nHis reply was a measure of Catalonia's emerging self-confidence. In an era when nationalist movements -- from Scotland to the Baltics and Belgium -- were finding their voice, Catalan politicians felt the tide of history was flowing in their favor.\n\nBarcelona's cosmopolitan self-assurance is often seen elsewhere as arrogance. Powell says that many other Spaniards feel Catalans 'have an annoying superiority complex. Catalans love to describe themselves as more 'European' than the rest of Spain.'\n\nIn Andalucia, one of Spain's poorer provinces, older people recall how they had to travel to Barcelona for work. Powell says Catalonia's economic take-off in the 1960s 'was largely possible thanks to the hundreds of thousands of immigrants from poorer parts of Spain (mainly Andalucía, Extremadura and Murcia) who went to work there.'\n\nThe most ardent expression of the rivalry is on the football field, when the two giants of La Liga, Barcelona and Real Madrid meet. As a former Barcelona FC President Joan Gaspart told writer Sid Lowe: 'History has transformed us into something more than a football club: Barcelona is the defense of a country, a language, a culture.' And Real Madrid was Franco's team.\n\nThe word 'Democracia', Catalan for 'Democracy', is displayed in the Camp Nou stadium board during FC Barcelona's match.\n\nOn Sunday, in the empty Camp Nou stadium , the scoreboard showed not the goal tally but one word: Democracia. But Barcelona's opponents, Las Palmas, had the Spanish flag embroidered into their shirts for the occasion.\n\nDespite the raw emotions, it would be wrong to see opinion on either side as monolithic. The result of this referendum was distorted by circumstances. Polling suggests that support for Catalan independence has slipped in recent years. In elections two years ago, the pro-independence parties won 48% of the vote\n\nElsewhere in Spain (with the exception of the Basque country, which has its own history with Madrid), many Spaniards disapprove of what they see as the central government's heavy-handed tactics and are anxious about the broader fallout. There is a real risk that the minority government in Madrid could collapse.\n\nThe leader of the small but expanding centrist party Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, was born in Barcelona and has a saying: 'Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country and Europe is our future.'\n\nBut we are where we are. Powell told CNN the government's 'use of force has tarnished its image at home and abroad. It looks incompetent as well as heavy-handed.'\n\nAs the newspaper El Pais wrote Sunday night, Spain's democracy faces its greatest challenge.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/02/europe/catalan-independence-referendum-history/index.html","1506916800.0"
"After Tokyo Commuter Train Leaves 20 Seconds Early, Company Apologizes\nAfter Tokyo Commuter Train Leaves 20 Seconds Early, Company Apologizes\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption JTB Photo/UIG via Getty Images JTB Photo/UIG via Getty Images\n\nPassengers on a morning train on the Tokyo region's Tsukuba Express line might not have noticed anything was amiss Tuesday. But when their train left Minami-Nagareyama station, it did so 20 seconds ahead of schedule — and when the company noticed, it issued an apology to customers.\n\nThe train was traveling northbound on the line that connects Tokyo's Akihabara station with Tsukuba to the northeast — a trip that takes less than an hour. After passengers had boarded, the crew didn't check the time, resulting in the slightly early departure 'around' 9:44 a.m., the company said.\n\nThe train had arrived at the station on time, at 40 seconds past 9:43 a.m. It was supposed to leave one minute later, at 9:44:40 — but instead, it left at 9:44:20.\n\n'We deeply apologize for the severe inconvenience imposed upon our customers,' the Metropolitan Intercity Railway Company said, in a translation by Sora News 24.\n\nIn its online posting, the rail company says it didn't receive any complaints from passengers over the 20-second discrepancy. It added that the train's crew has been spoken to and taught to prevent recurrences.\n\nOn the bright side, anyone who missed the 9:44 a.m. Tsukuba Express train because of the 20-second premature departure would have had to wait just four minutes for the next northbound train, according to the line's timetable.\n\nBut even a small lapse in punctuality can be disruptive, in part because, as Casey Baseel reports for Sora News 24, some people in Japan synchronize their phones or watches to the time shown in train stations, so they'll be sure to make their train.\n\nBaseel writes: 'It stands to reason, then, that at least a few people would miss a train if it left 20 seconds earlier than usual, and even if there's another coming in four minutes, adding four minutes to that leg of their commute might cause them to miss other transfers on the way to their destinations, with the effect snowballing enough that they end up being late for work or school.'\n\nCommenters on the story have had a range of reactions — including from people who say Japan's reputation for extreme punctuality in its trains is overblown.\n\nBut on Sora News and other sites, readers also noted that they would welcome such problems.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/16/564558279/after-tokyo-commuter-train-leaves-20-seconds-early-company-apologizes","1510808400.0"
"Bigelow Aerospace founder says commercial world will lead in space\nThere's a new space race and it's not between the U.S. and Russia. It's between private companies and it's attracted multimillionaires and billionaires, like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. A less likely player is Las Vegas real-estate tycoon, Robert Bigelow, who, at 73, is making the biggest gamble of his life -- not on rockets -- but on expandable spacecraft, large, lightweight structures that inflate in space, a technology that could dramatically change how humans live and work in zero gravity.\n\nCBS News\n\nNASA has partnered with Robert Bigelow, who's an unconventional figure in the aerospace world. He's more at home on the Vegas strip than at America's space agency, and he's obsessed with aliens and UFOs. In the spring of last year, he and NASA carried out an historic test to prove his high-flying technology is ready to support humans in space.\n\nWhen Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket roared into the skies above Cape Canaveral, it was on a mission for NASA, carrying nearly 7,000 pounds of cargo to the International Space Station -- food, supplies and Robert Bigelow's expandable spacecraft.\n\nRobert Bigelow: Flying to the International Space Station is a really big deal. It's an experimental spacecraft, which is a big deal. We don't know how it's gonna behave for sure.\n\nLara Logan: Does that make you nervous?\n\nRobert Bigelow: I'm nervous because I'm a nervous person, I think, and I don't necessarily always expect things to go right.\n\nCBS News\n\nBigelow's inflatable was packed inside the rocket's cargo capsule, known as Dragon, which you see here making it's way to the space station. We sped up this video from NASA because it took two days to get there.\n\nIt was moved into place, then just over a month later, we joined Bigelow at Houston Mission Control to see it inflate, the last critical step. If it worked, it would make history, the first expandable structure for humans in space.\n\nLara Logan: So what is it like for you this moment watching this happen?\n\nRobert Bigelow: Severe curiosity as to what's gonna happen next.\n\nSome 250 miles above the Earth, NASA astronaut Jeff Williams injected air. It was supposed to last about an hour. But took two tries over two days.\n\nFinally, it worked. In this time-lapse video, you're seeing it expand in seconds. Close to $300 million and 16 years to get here. But for Bigelow, it was just a beginning.\n\nCBS News\n\nUnder 80-foot ceilings at his company in Las Vegas, he showed us his next generation plans for outer space. He calls this the Olympus, a mansion for the skies. It's so large the rocket powerful enough to launch it is still years away.\n\nLara Logan: Is there anything this big that astronauts are working in today?\n\nRobert Bigelow: No, nothing even remotely close.\n\nBigelow said he can turn this into anything a client wants -- a first-ever orbiting hotel, hospital or inflatable research facility. The B330 is smaller than the Olympus. This is what it would look like if it were used as a space station.\n\nLara Logan: This can function on its own?\n\nRobert Bigelow: Well, it can function as a standalone destination because it has all the facilities that it would take to keep people alive.\n\nCBS News\n\nFor countries hoping to make their mark in space, Bigelow said this offers an affordable way in. Private industry, he believes, is becoming more dominant in developing space.\n\nRobert Bigelow: NASA and government still has a role because it is still in a sort of embryonic stage. And there will come a time when it's not necessary at all. And the commercial world will absolutely be the leader for everything in space.\n\nLara Logan: What about the idea of national pride and what we do as nations. Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. He didn't do that for a private company. He did that for the United States of America and it meant something.\n\n'...the commercial world will absolutely be the leader for everything in space.'\n\nRobert Bigelow: You bet it did. And that created a period of inspiration that hasn't been matched ever since. So now we're looking for a new era that says, 'All right, how can we now shape this to where it's more accessible for a lot more folks at a lot less cost and still have safety and reliability at the same time?'\n\nWith no formal training in science or engineering, Robert Bigelow created an aerospace company with scientists and engineers that's achieved what no one else in the industry has done. His expandable spacecraft are the first and only alternative to the metal structures that have housed every astronaut in space for over half a century.\n\nFor Bigelow, it all began with growing up in a time of nuclear tests. As a young boy, he would watch the skies over Nevada light up with the bursts of atomic bombs.\n\nRobert Bigelow: Witnessing those explosions in the 50s and 60s, you weren't aware of the ultimate ramifications of those kinds of things but there was a real strong feeling of energy and a secretiveness and so forth and it was cool.\n\nArmstrong: 'That's one small step for man…'\n\nLater, he watched Neil Armstrong take the first steps on the moon, a moment in history he said still inspires him.\n\nRobert Bigelow: The approach wasn't lightening fast…\n\nBut on this canyon road just outside Las Vegas, Robert Bigelow's story takes a turn that some may find, to put it lightly, improbable. He told us this is where his grandparents had a close encounter with a UFO.\n\nRobert Bigelow: It really sped up and came right into their face and filled up the entire windshield of the car. And it took off at a right angle and shot off into the distance.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe story sparked his obsession, and explains the alien looking out from the side of Bigelow Aerospace. And it made for the kind of conversation you don't ordinarily have with an accomplished CEO.\n\nLara Logan: Do you believe in aliens?\n\nRobert Bigelow: I'm absolutely convinced. That's all there is to it.\n\nLara Logan: Do you also believe that UFOs have come to Earth?\n\nRobert Bigelow: There has been and is an existing presence, an ET presence. And I spent millions and millions and millions -- I probably spent more as an individual than anybody else in the United States has ever spent on this subject.\n\nLara Logan: Is it risky for you to say in public that you believe in UFOs and aliens?\n\nRobert Bigelow: I don't give a damn. I don't care.\n\nLara Logan: You don't worry that some people will say, 'Did you hear that guy, he sounds like he's crazy'?\n\nRobert Bigelow: I don't care.\n\nLara Logan: Why not?\n\nRobert Bigelow: It's not gonna make a difference. It's not gonna change reality of what I know.\n\nLara Logan: Do you imagine that in our space travels we will encounter other forms of intelligent life?\n\nRobert Bigelow: You don't have to go anywhere.\n\nLara Logan: You can find it here? Where exactly?\n\nRobert Bigelow: It's just like right under people's noses. Oh my gosh. Wow.\n\nThe FAA confirmed to us that for years, it referred reports of UFOs and other unexplained phenomena to a company Bigelow owns. He told us he's had his own close encounters, but declined to go into detail.\n\nRobert Bigelow's quirky and he knows it, but when you have as much money as he does, no one -- not even NASA -- seems to care.\n\nHe bought the idea for his inflatable technology from the space agency. NASA had been working on this since the early 1960s -- but when Congress killed its program in 2000, Bigelow seized the opportunity and invested tens of millions of dollars to advance NASA's original idea.\n\nIt took him just six years to launch the first expandable spacecraft into orbit. His second followed a year later. But those were never meant for humans.\n\nAt that time, Bigelow was still trying to prove his inflatable structures would survive in space. A decade later, with both still circling the Earth intact, NASA felt the technology was ready to be tested for humans. Bigelow still monitors these spacecraft from his own mission control in Las Vegas.\n\nCBS News\n\nRobert Bigelow didn't start out a rich man. He made his fortune not far from the Vegas strip, with this -- a chain of low budget, long-stay rental apartments called Budget Suites of America. In a time of glitzy high rises, he focused on creating homes for the city's temporary workers. And it paid off. Today, he has 19 of these across three states.\n\nLara Logan: And made you how much money?\n\nRobert Bigelow: Enough to support the aerospace indulgence and Bigelow Aerospace.\n\nLara Logan: Well, 'aerospace indulgence' is a big term. So do you want to put a figure on that?\n\nRobert Bigelow: We're approaching 290 million.\n\nLara Logan: Of your own money?\n\nRobert Bigelow: Oh, yea yea.\n\nLara Logan: So for a man who has had extraordinary success in the business world--\n\nRobert Bigelow: Some some.\n\nLara Logan: This space business is financially the worst investment you've ever made?\n\nRobert Bigelow: It's atrocious. I mean, we are not in control of our own destiny.\n\nLara Logan: Who is in control of your destiny?\n\nRobert Bigelow: We're hostage to what happens with transportation, space transportation.\n\nThanks to innovators like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, Bigelow told us reusable rockets -- like this one you see sticking a perfect landing after launching his inflatable -- are making routine transportation a real possibility in the next decade.\n\nWhen Robert Bigelow's inflatable structure was added by NASA to the International Space Station, humans had never been inside one in space. This test would be the first time. And astronaut Jeff Williams, the first American to experience it.\n\nThe interior only has sensors, and for two years, NASA will use them to monitor how this holds up to solar radiation and extreme temperatures.\n\nLara Logan: How far are you from us right now?\n\nJeff Williams: Well currently we're over Libya as I recall, but when we started this conversation, I think we were probably over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nFrom Bigelow's Mission Control, NASA connected us with Jeff Williams on the space station. As we spoke to him about Bigelow's inflatable room, he was orbiting the Earth at nearly five miles a second.\n\nJeff Williams: I was very excited to be part of it and to be part of something new.\n\nLara Logan: And how is it holding up?\n\nJeff Williams: Oh, it's holding up well. It was a little bit cool, and that was expected. Cooler than the air here, but not overly cold, and had that new car smell that you would expect. And it was very quiet, too.\n\nLara Logan: What do you think about men like Mr. Bigelow, people with deep pockets, private citizens getting involved in your world, in the world of space?\n\nJeff Williams: Oh, I'd say anybody that has the means to do exploration and is willing to jump in the game, more power to them. Private enterprise is trying to open up economic doors to space exploration and everybody will benefit from that.\n\nProduced by Max McClellan.

"EU explores account freezes to prevent runs at failing banks\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states are considering measures which would allow them to temporarily stop people withdrawing money from their accounts to prevent bank runs, an EU document reviewed by Reuters revealed.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) headquarters building is seen in Frankfurt, Germany July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nThe move is aimed at helping rescue lenders that are deemed failing or likely to fail, but critics say it could hit confidence and might even hasten withdrawals at the first rumors of a bank being in trouble.\n\nThe proposal, which has been in the works since the beginning of this year, comes less than two months after a run on deposits at Banco Popular contributed to the collapse of the Spanish lender.\n\nIt also come amid a bitter wrangle among European countries over how to deal with troubled banks, roughly a decade after a financial crash that required the European Central Bank to print billions of euros to prevent a prolonged economic slump.\n\nGiving supervisors the power to temporarily block bank accounts at ailing lenders is “a feasible option,” a paper prepared by the Estonian presidency of the EU said, acknowledging that member states were divided on the issue.\n\nEU countries which already allow a moratorium on bank payouts in insolvency procedures at national level, like Germany, support the measure, officials said.\n\n“The desire is to prevent a bank run, so that when a bank is in a critical situation it is not pushed over the edge,” a person familiar with German government’s thinking said.\n\nTo cover for savers’ immediate financial needs, the Estonian paper, dated July 10, recommended the introduction of a mechanism that could allow depositors to withdraw “at least a limited amount of funds.”\n\nBanks, though, say it would discourage saving.\n\n“We strongly believe that this would incentivize depositors to run from a bank at an early stage,” Charlie Bannister of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking lobby group, said.\n\nThe Estonian proposal was discussed by EU envoys on July 13 but no decision was made, an EU official said. Discussions were due to continue in September. Approval of EU lawmakers would be required for any final decision.\n\nINSURED DEPOSITS\n\nThe plan, if agreed, would contrast with legislative proposals made by the European Commission in November that aimed to strengthen supervisors’ powers to suspend withdrawals, but excluded from the moratorium insured depositors, which under EU rules are those below 100,000 euros ($117,000).\n\nUnder the plan discussed by EU states, pay-outs could be suspended for five working days and the block could be extended to a maximum of 20 days in exceptional circumstances, the Estonian document said.\n\nExisting EU rules allow a two-day suspension of some payouts by failing banks, but the moratorium does not include deposits.\n\nThe Commission, which declined to comment on the discussion, had previously excluded insured deposits from the scope of the moratorium tool fearing it “may have a negative impact on market confidence,” according to a press release published in November.\n\nMany states supported a suspension of payouts only during the so-called resolution of a failing bank - the process which imposes losses on lenders’ investors and possibly also uninsured depositors, while preserving the continuity of the banking activities, the document said.\n\nMost countries opposed bolder plans for an early moratorium.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-banks-deposits/eu-explores-account-freezes-to-prevent-runs-at-failing-banks-idUSKBN1AD1RS","1501250903.0"

"Iraqi Kurdistan Is Holding an Independence Referendum\nFor the Kurds, the vote presents an opportunity to finally break away from Iraq.\n\n'We have the right to choose our destiny and fulfill our dream,' Dallo Mohammed, a 32-year-old accountant from the town of Khanaqin, told NBC News. 'I am a Kurdish citizen, this is how I was born, and this is how I would die.'\n\nBut opponents of the vote — a list of countries that includes the U.S. — say the ballot could provoke destabilization, ethnic violence, and hamper the fight against ISIS.\n\nWho are the Kurds?\n\nThey are the world's largest ethnic group who occupy one geographical area but don't have their own country.\n\nThey are mostly Sunni Muslims and their estimated population of 35 million spans a huge mountainous region across Iran, Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Armenia.\n\nThey were given hope of their own nation after World War I when the 1920 Treaty of Sevres carved up the Ottoman Empire and eked out a proposed state for Kurdistan.\n\nDisagreements and subsequent treaties meant that never happened.\n\nA man stains his finger with ink during the Kurdistan independence referendum in Kirkuk, Iraq, on Monday. Thaier Al-Sudani / Reuters\n\nToday, depending on which country they find themselves in, the Kurds are subject to a complex web of adversaries, allegiances and internal divisions.\n\nIn Turkey and Iran, they face discrimination and their organizations have been blacklisted as terrorists. In Iraq and Syria, however, they have proved among the most effective fighters pushing back ISIS, and they have received the backing of the Pentagon in both arenas.\n\nWhile the situation in Syria is far more messy, in Iraq the Kurds have established their own semi-autonomous region. Iraqi Kurdistan is an oil-rich province that encompasses one-third of the country and has emerged as the most secure area in an otherwise chaotic state.\n\nWhat is the vote about?\n\nMonday's referendum is asking people whether they want to expand this autonomy and become a fully fledged, independent country.\n\nMore than 3 million people are expected to participate, according to The Associated Press\n\n'They see this as a once-in-a-century opportunity to begin the process of forming their own state,' said Gareth Stansfield, a senior associate fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.\n\nThe Kurds have threatened to break off from the rest of Iraq for years.\n\nThey accuse the central government of violating its constitutional obligations toward them and withholding their share of the federal budget.\n\n'From World War I until now, we are not a part of Iraq,' Kurdish President Masoud Barzani told the Guardian on Friday. 'It’s a theocratic, sectarian state. We have our geography, land and culture. We have our own language. We refuse to be subordinates.'\n\nMap of Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nRight now may be their best shot at independence thanks to a confluence of events — namely the weakening of political systems surrounding them following two decades of violence and the rise of ISIS in 2014.\n\nBut even in the event of a 'yes' vote, the government says it won't separate right away. Rather, it sees the vote more as a statement of intent, a springboard from which to launch dialogue with the central Iraqi government.\n\nThe vote will cover not only areas in the official, semi-autonomous region but also disputed regions where the Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, have pushed into following their largely successful campaign against ISIS.\n\nThese peshmerga — whose name means 'those who face death' — have been fighting alongside the Iraqi army in the U.S.-led coalition, but it is the Kurds who have proved the far more effective fighting force.\n\nWhat does Iraq think about all this?\n\nThe central government in Baghdad has rejected the referendum as illegal and unconstitutional. Its Supreme Court has officially suspended the ballot — not that the Kurds are listening — and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has threatened military action if the vote leads to violence.\n\nIn a televised address from Baghdad on Sunday night, al-Abadi said that 'the referendum is unconstitutional. It threatens Iraq, peaceful coexistence among Iraqis and is a danger to the region.'\n\nSome Arab Iraqis, such as 44-year-old electrician Ali Hameed, believe the vote will bring more uncertainty to what is already a perilously fractious region.\n\n'This will create more problems for them,' said Hameed, who spoke to NBC News in his home city of Baghdad. 'Iran and Turkey will sooner or later have a reason to invade northern Iraq, and we know the Kurds do not have capabilities to fight' a war against those countries.\n\nA Kurdish woman wears a necklace bearing the Kurdish flag as she takes part in a gathering in the Iraqi town of Bahirka to urge people to vote in the referendum. Safin Hamed / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe prospect of violence doesn't deter Mohammed Ali, a 36-year-old Kurdish pharmacist from Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. He told NBC News his people would be prepared to stand up for their beliefs in the event of a military flare-up.\n\n'The only thing I am afraid of is that if the government in Baghdad tried to stand in our way,' he said. 'This might be the cause of a civil war between the Kurds and Arabs. The Kurds will fight for this, they will fight for their rights.'\n\nNechirvan Barzani, the Iraqi Kurdish prime minister and nephew of the president, has dismissed the possibility of violence. He told Kurdish network Rudaw: 'I do not see any military attack at all on the Kurdistan Region. It is impossible to happen.'\n\nHow about other neighboring countries?\n\nThere has been enormous outside pressure on the Iraqi Kurds to postpone the vote or cancel it entirely.\n\nTurkey and Iran issued a joint statement with Iraq saying they were considering deploying 'countermeasures,' although they didn't say what these might be.\n\nBoth countries are worried that an independence vote might inspire an upsurge in separatism among their own Kurdish populations.\n\nTurkey has for years been locked in conflict with the Marxist militant separatist Kurdistan Workers Party, commonly known as the PKK, and it has also been fighting the Kurds in Syria, who it sees as an extension of its own rebels.\n\nAn Iraqi Kurd shows his finger after voting at a polling station in Irbil during Monday's referendum. MOHAMED MESSARA / EPA\n\nTo get an idea of how truly complex this picture is, the U.S. is a NATO ally of Turkey, but the Pentagon is also arming the Syrian Kurds, even though Turkey and the Kurds have been fighting each other.\n\nIn Iraq, Turkey's relationship with the Kurdistan Regional Government is more nuanced. Whereas Turkey opposes its own Kurds, it has forged strong military and economic ties with those in Iraq. Crucially these ties involve a pipeline that runs from landlocked Kurdistan to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.\n\n'After [the referendum], let's see through which channels the northern Iraqi regional government will send its oil, or where it will sell it,' President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in Istanbul on Monday according to Reuters. 'We have the tap. The moment we close the tap, then it's done.'\n\nTurkey is also conducting military exercises along its border with Iraqi Kurdistan, and Erdogan confirmed this was no coincidence.\n\n'Our military is not [at the border] for nothing,' he added Monday, according to an AP report. 'We could arrive suddenly one night.'\n\nThat Turkey hasn't intervened already has led some to suggest that while it doesn't want to openly support the referendum, in private it might see it as a positive step in its pragmatic and transactional relationship.\n\n'Turkey could have easily stopped [the referendum] in its tracks simply by threatening to close the oil pipeline for extended periods of routine maintenance,' Stansfield wrote in a paper for RUSI earlier this month.\n\n'This has not happened,' he said. 'This raises the possibility that the Kurdish view may be right — that Turkey is publicly positioning itself to be unsupportive ... but privately sees several benefits in embracing independence.'\n\nWhat about the U.S.?\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense has found the Iraqi and Syrian Kurds to be a ruthless anti-ISIS force, this has not translated to White House support for independence.\n\n'The United States strongly opposes the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government’s referendum on independence,' State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. sees the possibility of a fracturing Iraq as a destabilizing force in an already unsettled region politically — not to mention hampering the ongoing fight against ISIS.\n\nVoters wait to cast their ballots in Irbil, Iraq, on Monday. Chris McGrath / Getty Images\n\n'The costs of proceeding with the referendum are high for all Iraqis, including Kurds,' Nauert added. 'Already the referendum has negatively affected ... coordination to dislodge ISIS from its remaining areas of control in Iraq.'\n\nMany Kurds don't see it that way. They see a country that, referendum or not, is already flawed and has not worked in their interests for decades.\n\n'The region is already not stable,' said Omar Khoshnau, a 38-year-old salesman from Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. 'The war against ISIS is going to be more effective if Kurdistan is an independent state, because it is an ally for the international community, and we are the first who fought ISIS.'\n\nWhat would a 'yes' vote mean?\n\nA nod for independence would be no doubt symbolic but its practical implications are harder to pin down.\n\nThe referendum question asks: 'Do you want the Kurdistan region and the Kurdistani areas outside the region’s administration to become an independent state?'\n\nKurdish peshmerga fighters take part in a gathering to support the referendum near Irbil, Iraq. Gailan Haji / EPA\n\nBut it has no formal framework or mechanism for how this might work. Instead, the president has said the decision will be the trigger for meaningful dialogue with Baghdad.\n\nAccording to Marianna Charountaki, a lecturer in Kurdish politics at Britain's University of Leicester, the vote is mainly figurative anyway.\n\n'The reality is that there's already de facto independence and now we're just talking about the outward appearance and official titles,' she said.\n\nThere are many sticking points including disputed areas that the peshmerga pushed into after the Iraqi army abandoned fled as ISIS rampaged across the country. These include the key, oil-rich city of Kirkuk.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iraqi-kurdistan-set-hold-referendum-its-independence-n803741","None"
"China’s Appetite Pushes Fisheries to the Brink\nMany of the Chinese boat owners rely on government money to build vessels and fuel their journeys to Senegal, a monthlong trip from crowded ports in China. Over all, government subsidies to the fishing industry reached nearly $22 billion between 2011 and 2015, nearly triple the amount spent during the previous four years, according to Zhang Hongzhou, a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nThat figure, he said, does not include the tens of millions in subsidies and tax breaks that coastal Chinese cities and provinces provide to support local fishing companies.\n\nAccording to one study by Greenpeace, subsidies for some Chinese fishing companies amount to a significant portion of their income. For one large state-owned company, CNFC Overseas Fisheries, the $12 million diesel subsidy it received last year made the difference between profit and loss, according to a corporate filing.\n\n“Chinese fleets are all over the world now, and without these subsidies, the industry just wouldn’t be sustainable,” said Li Shuo, a global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. “For Senegal and other countries of West Africa, the impact has been devastating.”\n\nIn Senegal, an impoverished nation of 14 million, fishing stocks are plummeting. Local fishermen working out of hand-hewn canoes compete with megatrawlers whose mile-long nets sweep up virtually every living thing. Most of the fish they catch is sent abroad, with a lot ending up as fishmeal fodder for chickens and pigs in the United States and Europe.\n\nVideo\n\nThe sea’s diminishing returns mean plummeting incomes for fishermen and higher food prices for Senegalese citizens, most of whom depend on fish as their primary source of protein.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“We are facing an unprecedented crisis,” said Alassane Samba, a former director of Senegal’s oceanic research institute. “If things keep going the way they are, people will have to eat jellyfish to survive.”\n\nWhen it comes to global fishing operations, China is the indisputable king of the sea.

"Peru floods kill 67 and spark criticism of country's climate change preparedness\nDevastating downpour, caused by high ocean temperatures, could not have been predicted, president said, months after state of emergency declared for wildfires\n\nSixty-seven people have been killed and thousands more forced to evacuate by intense rains which damaged 115,000 homes and destroyed more than 100 bridges in Peru’s worst floods in recent memory.\n\n\n\n“We are confronting a serious climatic problem,” said Peru’s president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, in a broadcast to the nation on Friday afternoon. “There hasn’t been an incident of this strength along the coast of Peru since 1998.”\n\nThe disaster – which came after a period of severe drought – has been blamed on abnormally high temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, and fuelled criticism that the country is ill-prepared for the growing challenges of climate change.\n\nOver the past three days, the downpour has burst river banks, created mudslides, collapsed bridges, closed roads and forced school suspensions in swaths of the west and north of the country.\n\n\n\nRains continued to lash the northern Piura region where streets remained flooded in the regional capital and homes had been washed away in poorer neighbourhoods.\n\nBy Thursday night, the floodwaters had subsided in the city’s La Primavera slum, but the floor of Shirley Moran’s home was a sea of dried mud and half-buried children’s toys.\n\n“The water came up to our knees, the only thing we could do was run for our lives and to try and keep calm,” said Moran in the battered home she shared with five siblings.\n\nEven the capital city, Lima, where a desert climate means that rain is rare, was lashed by a downpour which flooded outlying neighbourhoods.\n\nWith temperatures still high, the meteorological agency expects the rain front to move inland and south over the coming days and has issued a highest-level weather warning for the Amazon part of the Cusco, Ucayali and Huánuco regions.\n\nIt is not the first time this year that Peru has been affected. Two months ago, tourists in Machu Picchu were stranded by mudslides and had to be airlifted.\n\nThe prime minister, Fernando Zavala, said 176 districts had already declared emergencies.\n\nAbraham Levy, a Peruvian meteorologist, said the weather conditions were “extremely unusual” and the storms and flooding were caused by the “atypical” warming of sea surface temperatures off Peru’s northern coast by five to six degrees to 29C.\n\nHe described the phenomenon as a “coastal El Niño”. The last time this was seen was nearly a century ago in 1925.\n\n“We’ve had these kinds of El Niños as long as we have historical data, so it’s very difficult to link climate change or even global warming to these events,” he said.\n\nOther scientists say a global trend of rising sea temperatures was likely to have contributed to the recent storms.\n\nPeru declares state of emergency over deadly forest fires Read more\n\nIn November Peru declared a state of emergency when wildfires tore through drought-stricken areas burning nearly 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of land.\n\n“We’ve rarely seen this kind of rapid and quick change in climatic conditions,” Juber Ruiz, from Peru’s civil defense institute, told Reuters.\n\nScientists accused Peruvian authorities of ignoring a warning to countries in the region that there was a severe risk of drought, and opposition politicians have accused the government of failing to respond adequately to forecasts of increasingly frequent extreme weather events.\n\n“We know the ‘coastal El Niño’ comes from time to time. We know we are a country that is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We should have prepared ourselves better,” said the leader of the New Peru movement, Verónika Mendoza, earlier this week.\n\nThe frustrations of those affected were evident in Tambogrande, Piura, where dozens called for help as the country’s education minister, Marilú Martens, briefly visited the town by helicopter.\n\n\n\n“We are dealing with this emergency in the short term, but of course we need long-term strategies to avoid these situations so the people are not continually suffering in these emergencies,” Martens told the Guardian. She said the government has set aside $800m Peruvian soles for Peru’s hard-hit north and would implement programmes to prevent the spread of diseases such as dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes which breed in stagnant water.\n\nA spokesman for the Peruvian ministry of environment said it was premature to attribute the floods to climate change though there are studies which suggest the El Niño phenomenon will become more frequent as a result of global warming.\n\n“It is a duty of our government and society to work in order to reduce risk of vulnerability,” said Dimitri Gutiérrez. “Part of this work should be investing more for urban and territorial use planning.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/17/peru-floods-ocean-climate-change","1489723200.0"
"North Korea crisis: Where to now after 'fire and fury'?\nImage copyright EPA Image caption US bombers recently flew a mission over the Korean peninsula as a warning to Pyongyang\n\nIn the escalating war of words between the United States and North Korea, one assumes that Kim Jong-un's propaganda machine is now working overtime.\n\nAfter threatening revenge 'a thousand fold' in response to United Nations sanctions over its destabilising lurch towards a nuclear capability, how can Pyongyang top President Donald Trump's return volley, through which he pledged 'fire and fury like the world has never seen' if North Korea continues to threaten the United States?\n\nFirst, let's put this latest exchange in context. How much of this have we experienced before? And to what extent are we beginning to break new and dangerous ground?\n\nTerminology surrounding North Korea has always seemed backwards. The end of the Korean War in 1953 technically represented a cessation of hostilities between the two sides. But in reality there has been open hostility ever since.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen'\n\nThe US and North Korea came very close to armed conflict in 1994 after Pyongyang refused to allow international inspectors access to its nuclear facilities as required under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nThat crisis was resolved diplomatically, but it set the stage for a two-decade cat and mouse game where North Korea paid lip service to its pledge to denuclearise but kept its options open to build an actual weapon and the means to deliver it.\n\nOver time, while the international community offered North Korea normal relations in return for denuclearisation, Pyongyang wanted normal relations and nuclear weapons. Without admitting it, the US policy became containment, preventing North Korea from exporting its nuclear know-how while hoping that its erratic regime would implode before it actually obtained a nuclear deterrent.\n\nUltimate insurance policy\n\nIn recent years, two key developments changed the basic contours of the North Korea problem.\n\nFirst, the removals of Saddam Hussein by the Bush administration and Muammar Gaddafi by the Obama administration - two leaders who contemplated nuclear weapons but didn't actually build them - led Pyongyang to a simple conclusion: an actual nuclear capability is the ultimate regime insurance policy.\n\nAnd second, Kim Jong-il passed away in late 2011. The elder Kim was sufficiently deferential to his primary benefactor, China, that he maintained plausible deniability as to North Korea's actual nuclear capability. Kim Jong-un, his son and successor, has abandoned all pretence and is openly racing to obtain a demonstrated nuclear deterrent.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption There is growing alarm in South Korea as tensions rise between Washington and Pyongyang\n\nThe Trump administration must decide what it can and cannot live with, and what to do about a situation that is rapidly moving from bad to worse.\n\nTo his credit, even as a candidate, President Trump placed the North Korea issue at or near the top of his list of national security concerns. And he has consistently called on China, North Korea's leading trading partner, to do more to rein in its client state.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr Trump has underestimated the risk and complexity surrounding the North Korea problem. While he vowed early in his tenure that he would solve it one way or another, he ignored the reality that there are no good policy options available.\n\nAt one level, President Trump's threat of fire and fury is not new. In many different forms, albeit not as colourful, the US has always said that if North Korea ever attacks, the regime will cease to exist. That said, Mr Trump's rhetoric seemed to suggest that he was prepared to take pre-emptive action if North Korea gets closer to an actual nuclear deterrent.\n\nBut any use of force immediately places hundreds of thousands of South Koreans and Japanese citizens at risk. North Korea will almost certainly respond to a pre-emptive attack.\n\nWhat is different about this cycle is the lack of a diplomatic process that could serve as a firebreak.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a recent media briefing that the United States is open to dialogue with North Korea, provided talks are about ending missile tests and giving up nuclear weapons. Pyongyang, even as it confronts new sanctions, is unlikely to agree to those conditions.\n\nWhile China welcomed Mr Tillerson's gesture, North Korea's young leader doesn't seem to care what Beijing thinks. And the next move is his.\n\nThe danger is that at some point, the over-heated rhetoric creates an action-reaction cycle without an obvious reverse gear.\n\nThey fire a missile. We slap on more sanctions. They promise revenge. We declare these threats intolerable. They fire another missile. Then what?\n\nThis is where rhetoric meets strategy. But it's unclear if there is one behind Trump's fire and fury.\n\nPJ Crowley is a former US Assistant Secretary of State and author of Red Line: America Foreign Policy in a Time of Fractured Politics and Failing States.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40871754","None"
"Militants Kill 305 at Sufi Mosque in Egypt’s Deadliest Terrorist Attack\nCAIRO — Militants detonated a bomb inside a crowded mosque in the Sinai Peninsula on Friday and then sprayed gunfire on panicked worshipers as they fled, killing at least 305 people and wounding at least 128 others. Officials called it the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt’s modern history.\n\nThe scale and ruthlessness of the assault, in an area racked by an Islamist insurgency, sent shock waves across the nation — not just for the number of deaths but also for the choice of target. Attacks on mosques are rare in Egypt, where the Islamic State has targeted Coptic Christian churches and pilgrims but avoided Muslim places of worship.\n\nThe attack injected a new element into Egypt’s struggle with militants because most of the victims were Sufi Muslims, who practice a mystical form of Islam that the Islamic State and other Sunni extremist groups deem heretical. And it underscored the failure of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has justified his harsh crackdown on political freedom in the name of crushing Islamic militancy, to deliver on his promises of security.\n\n“The scene was horrific,” said Ibrahim Sheteewi, a resident of Bir al-Abed, the small north Sinai town where the attack took place. “The bodies were scattered on the ground outside the mosque. I hope God punishes them for this.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/world/middleeast/mosque-attack-egypt.html","1511499600.0"

"How India and China Have Come to the Brink Over a Remote Mountain Pass\nThe dispute dates to contradictory phrases in an 1890 border agreement between two now-defunct empires, British India and China’s Qing dynasty, that put the border in different places. One gives Bhutan control of the area — the position that India supports — and the other China.\n\n“This comes down to both countries having a reasonable claim,” said Ankit Panda, a senior editor at The Diplomat, an Asian affairs journal.\n\nBhutan and India say that China, by extending its road, is trying to extend its control over an area known as the Dolam Plateau, part of a larger contested area.\n\nThe plateau’s southernmost ridge slopes into a valley that geographers call the Siliguri Corridor but that Indian strategists know as the Chicken Neck.\n\nTIBET CHINA NEPAL BHUTAN INDIA Dolam Plateau Siliguri Corridor BANGLADESH INDIA MYANMAR 150 Miles TIBET CHINA NEPAL BHUTAN INDIA Dolam Plateau Siliguri Corridor BANGLADESH INDIA MYANMAR 150 Miles\n\nThis narrow strip of Indian territory, at points less than 20 miles wide, connects the country’s central mass to its northeastern states. India has long feared that in a war, China could bisect the corridor, cutting off 45 million Indians and an area the size of the United Kingdom.\n\nIndia’s Aggressive Response\n\nFew countries have been eager to confront China’s regional ambitions as directly with military forces, which has made India’s response to the construction so striking and, according to analysts from both countries, so fraught with danger.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in recent months, India’s leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has shown that he is willing to flout China’s wishes — and ignore its threats.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn April, a top Indian official accompanied the Dalai Lama to the border of Tibet, shrugging off China’s public insistence that the journey be halted. In May, India boycotted the inauguration of President Xi Jinping’s signature “One Belt, One Road” project, saying the plan ignored “core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\n\nThe border skirmish arose even as Mr. Modi visited Washington to court President Trump’s favor as India vies with China for influence in Asia.\n\n“I hope the Indian side knows what it’s doing, because the moment you put your hand in the hornet’s nest, you have to be prepared for whatever consequence there is going to be,” said Shiv Kunal Verma, the author of “1962: The War That Wasn’t,” about the bloody border conflict the two countries fought that year.\n\nChinese officials say the construction of the road was an internal affair because, they say, it took place within China’s own borders. On Tuesday, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, reiterated the country’s warning to India to withdraw as a precondition for any broader talks. “The solution to this issue is also very simple,” he said during a visit to Thailand, addressing the Indians directly. “That is, behave yourself and humbly retreat.”\n\nBhutan, Caught in the Middle\n\nPhoto\n\nBhutan, which joined the United Nations in 1971, does not have diplomatic relations with China. It has always been closer to India, particularly after fears stemming from China’s annexation of Tibet, another Buddhist kingdom, in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nSince then, India has played a central role in the kingdom’s administration, contributing nearly $1 billion in economic and military aid annually in recent years. China has sought to woo Bhutan with its own offers of aid, investments and land swaps to settle border disputes.\n\nTwo weeks after the construction began, Bhutan’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying it violated earlier agreements, and called for a return to the status quo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Bhutan has felt uncomfortable from the start,” said Ajai Shukla, a former army colonel and consulting editor for strategic affairs at Business Standard, a daily newspaper in India. “It does not want to be caught in the middle when China and India are taking potshots at each other. Bhutan does not want to be the bone in a fight between two dogs.”\n\nPhoto\n\nThe confrontation, meantime, has soured already tense relations.\n\nMr. Modi and Mr. Xi both attended the recent Group of 20 meeting in Germany but did not hold a meeting, one on one, that might have defused tensions. India’s national security adviser is expected to attend a meeting in Beijing this week, which analysts say could signal whether any face-saving compromise is possible.\n\nMr. Xi is preparing for an important Communist Party congress in the fall that will inaugurate his second five-year term as president and consolidate his political pre-eminence. Given the unbending nature of Chinese statements, few analysts believe he would do anything that would seem weak in response to India’s moves.\n\n“It may be harder to make concessions until after that gathering,” Shashank Joshi, an analyst at the Lowy Institute, wrote in an essay posted on Friday, “while it may even suit Beijing to keep the crisis simmering through this period.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/world/asia/dolam-plateau-china-india-bhutan.html","1501041600.0"
"Roman Theater Discovery Near Jerusalem's Western Wall Delights Archaeologists\n“The work started two years ago, and we couldn't even stand up straight,” archaeologist Tehillah Lieberman told NBC News. “We were crawling from a hole in the ceiling and dug it all by hand.'\n\nLieberman's team was looking for a street that they suspected passed through the site from 530 B.C. to 70 A.D.\n\nBut the researchers were puzzled when they exposed the remnants. Eventually a circle-shaped structure started to emerge.\n\n“Everything got a lot more exciting since we understood we were exposing history,” Lieberman said.\n\nThe theater was uncovered underneath Wilson's Arch, next to the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Yaniv Berman courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority\n\nExperts have been looking for a Roman theater since the dawn of archaeological research in Jerusalem more than 150 years ago.\n\nThe city was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. and eventually turned into a Roman colony.\n\nBased on historical writings, archaeologists knew that like any other city in the Roman Empire, Jerusalem had to have a theater.\n\nWhat Lieberman and her colleagues unearthed looks a great deal like what generations of archaeologists before them were feverishly searching for.\n\nArchaeologists had different opinions of where the theater might actually be, but it appears no one guessed that it would be hiding right next to the Western Wall itself.\n\nTehillah Lieberman, the archaeologist in charge of the dig near the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City, stands at the site of the excavation as a worker continues to clear rubble. Behind her is the Roman construction she unearthed, and in the background, the Western Wall. Dave Copeland\n\nLieberman said the theater, which apparently seat about 200 people, is not like the bigger examples seen in other cities held by the Romans.\n\n'It has the same structure, the same semicircular stepped building,' she said. 'It's just a lot smaller.'\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether the theater was ever actually used.\n\nOne of its staircases was never completely hewn. Some speculate that a Jewish revolt against Rome, which occurred from 132-135 A.D., might have halted construction and left the theater unfinished.\n\nLieberman says the find sheds more light on Jerusalem of the late Roman period, a time that historians don’t know much about.\n\nMost of the major public structures from Roman Jerusalem — the large theater forum, basilica and bathhouse — have yet to be uncovered.\n\n“Jerusalem was always inhabited and there were always different cultures and nations that lived here,” Lieberman said. “It's very hard to find the remains from the different periods. You usually find a foundation here, a wall there. But to find something standing completely whole doesn't happen so much in Jerusalem, especially not from the late Roman period.'\n\nResearchers have at least another 10 feet of ground below the theater to excavate to see what other discoveries may be awaiting underneath. The Israeli Antiquities Authority says the excavation site may eventually be opened to the public.\n\nPaul Goldman reported from Jerusalem, and Yuliya Talmazan from London.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/roman-theater-discovery-near-jerusalem-s-western-wall-delights-archaeologists-n814101","None"

"Video shows an officer slamming, then pummeling a black man accused of jaywalking\nAn investigation is underway into whether Sacramento police used excessive force against an unarmed black man accused of jaywalking. (Reuters)\n\nIn less than a minute, a police stop over claims of jaywalking devolved into what many are calling a troubling example of excessive force: a white officer walloping a black man with more than a dozen punches on a Sacramento street.\n\nThe officer involved has been suspended, Sacramento police said, and is the subject of an internal and a criminal investigation.\n\nOn Monday, Nandi Cain Jr. had just gotten off work and was headed to his Sacramento apartment when he noticed an officer approaching from behind him with his hand on his gun, according to police accounts, videos of the event and local news reports. Cain put his hands up as the officer approached, but continued to walk away slowly. He asked the police officer the reason for the stop, then protested when he heard it:\n\n[Sessions orders Justice Dept. to end forensic science commission, suspend review policy]\n\n“You were jaywalking,” the officer said on the dash-cam video released by the police department this week.\n\n“I looked both ways,” Cain replied. “You’re harassing me. I just got off work. You’re trying to pull me over for nothing.”\n\nThe officer, a two-year member of the Sacramento police force who has not been identified by authorities, then told Cain to stop or he would take him to the ground.\n\n“So, what, you holding on to your gun?” Cain asked. “You a big man because you got a gun? You going to hold onto your gun?”\n\nThe officer stepped forward and grabbed Cain, slamming him to the ground. The officer then straddled Cain and punched him repeatedly. Soon other officers sped to the scene and helped subdue and handcuff Cain.\n\n[A body cam captured a cop’s violent encounter with a teen — but a new law keeps the video secret]\n\nThe entire incident was caught on video by several police dash cams and the cellphone of an acquaintance of Cain’s who was passing by. In their statement, Sacramento police officials said they have reviewed the video and “determined the officer’s actions appeared to be outside of policy.”\n\n“The actions of the involved Sacramento Police Officer are disturbing and does not appear to be reasonable based upon the circumstances,” the statement said.\n\nPolice also said there were “insufficient grounds” to charge Cain with jaywalking. An officer delivered paperwork to the jail to have him released, though Cain still faces a court date on an outstanding warrant.\n\n.@SacPolice deputy chief calls altercation with Nandi Cain 'disturbing' pic.twitter.com/Adkw9eBUNA — Tom Miller (@KCRAMiller) April 12, 2017\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, Cain told Sacramento NBC-affiliate KCRA that he feared the officers were going to shoot and kill him, even after he was handcuffed.\n\n“I thought I was going to be like the next Trayvon Martin,” he said. “I thought, as soon as they got me on the ground and they start putting my arms in different positions. I felt like they were going to draw a gun out and shoot me in my back or try to break my arms off or something.\n\n” … I think the best way I fought for my life was just silence … Just (be) silent. Don’t say nothing. Don’t move. Don’t do nothing. Don’t give them a reason. Because that’s what they wanted, a reason for me to pop off and get the reaction that they wanted out of me.”\n\n[A mentally ill veteran kept banging on his cell. So jailers beat him into a coma, a complaint says.]\n\nOn Monday night, 40 demonstrators gathered in front of one of the police department’s substations, with many wearing shirts that said “Black Lives Matter,” according to the Sacramento Bee. Cain’s girlfriend, who was among the demonstrators, said he was “still in pain and recovering.”\n\nThe case occurred as police departments across the United States are under increased scrutiny amid claims that they are too quick to use force against blacks and other minorities. So far this year, 284 people have been shot and killed by police, according to The Washington Post’s Fatal Force database. Of those, 25 percent were black. Last year, 963 people were shot and killed by police, including 233 black people.\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the Justice Department to review reform agreements at police departments across the nation. The review includes some consent decrees that encouraged police departments to train their officers on how to better resolve situations without using force, according to The Post’s Sari Horwitz, Mark Berman and Wesley Lowery.\n\nRead more:\n\n‘I was just reading a book’: Canadian cops called on black man reading C.S.

"Saudi Arabia Calls Iran 'Outlaw State,' Hails Corruption Crackdown\nBreaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nSaudi Arabia has doubled down on its claims that Iran was responsible for a missile attack on Riyadh, its capital, calling for stiff sanctions on a regional rival it accuses of spreading extremism and terrorism.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Riyadh on Thursday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir also said the world should be reassured by a sweeping corruption crackdown that has already netted high-ranking princes and business leaders.\n\nAl-Jubeir called Iran an “outlaw state” that is “on a rampage,” adding that it should face sanctions over its ballistic missile program, its support for the powerful Lebanese militia and political party Hezbollah, and its role in other conflicts such as the war in neighboring Yemen.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir Alex Brandon / AFP - Getty Images\n\n“Iran is all over the place in a very negative and hostile way,” he said. “The whole world is determined to push back against Iran.”\n\nAl-Jubeir was speaking five days after a ballistic missile fired from Yemen toward Riyadh was shot down by Saudi defense forces. A Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-linked Houthi militants in Yemen, a conflict that has led to one of world's worst humanitarian crises.\n\n“We hold Iran responsible for this — they’re the ones that provided the missiles,” al-Jubeir said. “We believe this could be considered an act of war.”\n\nAsked if Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim monarchy, was heading for a war with the Shiite republic, he said, 'I hope not.'\n\n'A sizeable amount of our budget, we discovered, was being stolen' 'A sizeable amount of our budget, we discovered, was being stolen'\n\nHe added that he would not 'comment on rumors' that Saudi Arabia was working with Israel against Hezbollah.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, although the two face a common enemy in Iran. Shortly after the interview with CNBC, Saudi Arabia ordered its citizens out of Lebanon amid worsening tensions between their two governments.\n\nAl-Jubeir added: “Iran is an outlaw state … the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism. The evidence is irrefutable that Iran has assassinated diplomats around the world … [and] needs to be held accountable for the mischief it is causing.”\n\nIran denies any direct aid to Yemen’s Houthis, and its foreign minister, Javad Zarif, on Tuesday hit back at Saudi Arabia's claims, accusing it of “wars of aggression, regional bullying, destabilizing behavior and risky provocations.”\n\nAl-Jubair is one of the few Saudi officials to have spoken openly since the region was rocked by a crackdown on corruption ordered by Saudi Arabia’s young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who says he is determined to remodel the country into a modern state that is less economically dependent on oil.\n\nRelated: Prince Aims to Rebrand Saudi Arabia From 9/11 Hotbed of Extreme Islam\n\nEleven top princes and four ministers were among those rounded up Saturday according to Al Arabiya, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the Middle East’s richest people and an investor in Twitter, Apple, Citigroup, and the Four Seasons, Fairmont and Movenpick hotel chains.\n\nSaudi Arabia's attorney general said Thursday that a total of 201 people remained in detention after the sweep, suspected of embezzlement and corruption worth $100 billion.\n\nAl-Jubeir denied there was a lack of transparency, and said there was evidence that senior figures had taken large amounts of money from public funds.\n\n“Under our legal system we don’t publicize names until after the verdicts are out,” he said, adding that “individuals will have trials in accordance with our laws and they will be held accountable.”\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud chats with his son and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Reuters\n\nSalman “has made it very clear that no prince, no minister or high-ranking official is immune from corruption charges,” he said. “A sizable amount of our budget, we discovered, was being stolen. You cannot have effective, transparent government. Money was stolen from the public treasury, and that robbed the country of the ability to invest it for the good of its people.”\n\nHe said the world should look favorably on the detentions. “I think it will increase investor confidence in Saudi Arabia. … It shows that we have adopted a zero tolerance policy on corruption.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has applauded the crackdown, posting on Twitter that the crown prince and his father, King Salman, 'know exactly what they are doing.'\n\nRelated: 'Davos in the Desert' Offers Glimpse of Changing Saudi Arabia\n\n'Some of those they are harshly treating have been 'milking' their country for years!'

Something will have to be done.”\n\nTrump added: “I don’t draw red lines,” repeating his criticism of President Barack Obama’s stance over Syria and chemical weapons.\n\nIn his remarks to a packed crowd of thousands in Krasinski Square, Trump also pledged to confront the 'dire threats to our security and our way of life.'\n\nThe president said America and Europe 'have suffered one terror attack after another' and he promised that the U.S.'s borders will be closed to 'extremism and terrorism of any kind.'\n\nTrump declared the West’s survival “the fundamental question of our time,” lashing out at “the steady creep of government bureaucracy” that he said “drains the vitality and wealth of the people.”\n\n'Defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means, but also on the will of its people to prevail,' said the president, who was repeatedly interrupted with chants from the enthusiastic crowd. 'The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.'\n\nRelated: Read the Full Text of Donald Trump's Speech in Poland\n\nThousands lined the sun-drenched square to secure a vantage point for Trump's speech.

"How Syria's White Helmets became victims of an online propaganda machine\nThe Syrian volunteer rescue workers known as the White Helmets have become the target of an extraordinary disinformation campaign that positions them as an al-Qaida-linked terrorist organisation.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian has uncovered how this counter-narrative is propagated online by a network of anti-imperialist activists, conspiracy theorists and trolls with the support of the Russian government (which provides military support to the Syrian regime).\n\nThe White Helmets, officially known as the Syria Civil Defence, is a humanitarian organisation made up of 3,400 volunteers – former teachers, engineers, tailors and firefighters – who rush to pull people from the rubble when bombs rain down on Syrian civilians. They’ve been credited with saving thousands of civilians during the country’s continuing civil war.\n\nThey have also exposed, through first-hand video footage, war crimes including a chemical attack in April. Their work was the subject of an Oscar-winning Netflix documentary and the recipient of two Nobel peace prize nominations.\n\nDespite this positive international recognition, there’s a counter-narrative pushed by a vocal network of individuals who write for alternative news sites countering the “MSM agenda”. Their views align with the positions of Syria and Russia and attract an enormous online audience, amplified by high-profile alt-right personalities, appearances on Russian state TV and an army of Twitter bots.\n\nThe way the Russian propaganda machine has targeted the White Helmets is a neat case study in the prevailing information wars. It exposes just how rumours, conspiracy theories and half-truths bubble to the top of YouTube, Google and Twitter search algorithms.\n\n“This is the heart of Russian propaganda. In the old days they would try and portray the Soviet Union as a model society. Now it’s about confusing every issue with so many narratives that people can’t recognise the truth when they see it,” said David Patrikarakos, author of War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Reshaping Conflict in the 21st Century.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The first page of results for ‘White Helmets’ on YouTube shows how the conspiracy theories bubble to the top of search engines. Photograph: YouTube\n\nHybrid warfare\n\n\n\nThe campaign to discredit the White Helmets started at the same time as Russia staged a military intervention in Syria in September 2015, supporting President Bashar al-Assad’s army with airstrikes bombarding opposition-held areas. Almost immediately, Russian state media such as RT and Sputnik started falsely claiming that Isis was the only target and throwing doubt on the bombings of infrastructure and civilian sites.\n\nThe same propaganda machine scooped up fringe anti-American activists, bloggers and researchers who believe the White Helmets are terrorists, giving them a platform on state TV and amplifying their articles through social media.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that these activists and bloggers are knowingly spreading disinformation, although the stories are often thinly sourced.\n\nScott Lucas, professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham, describes the overall campaign as “agitation propaganda” but said that some of its participants don’t realise they are being used as pawns.\n\n“The most effective propaganda is when you find someone who believes it then give them support – you don’t create them from scratch,” he added.\n\nWhy the White Helmets?\n\nThe White Helmets play two roles within Syria. The first is their rescue work: providing an ambulance service, fire service and search and rescue in conflict areas where infrastructure has been decimated.\n\nThe second role is the documentation of what is taking place within the country via handheld and helmet cameras.\n\n“This is the thing that has annoyed not just the Assad regime and Russian authorities but a lot of the propagandists who work in their orbit,” said Amnesty International’s Kristyan Benedict, a crisis response manager who specialises in Syria.\n\nTheir footage has helped organisations like Amnesty and the Syria Justice and Accountability Center corroborate testimony they receive from people in Syria via phone, Skype and WhatsApp. It allows them to check the aftermath of airstrikes to see whether civilians were targeted and whether there was any military presence or checkpoints.\n\n“That’s really been damaging to the war narrative of Syria and Russia,” said Benedict.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raed al-Saleh, head of the White Helmets. Photograph: Bernd von Jutrczenka/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt was the White Helmets’ footage that documented the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun in April, which killed at least 83 people, a third of them children. UN war crimes investigators later concluded the attack was carried out by the Syrian regime against its own people. Russian state media and a network of supportive alternative news sites continue to cast doubt on investigators’ findings, describing it as “illogical” and “deliberately staged” by militants. The alt-right site Infowars repeated the conspiracy theory, describing the attack as staged by the White Helmets, who were described as an “al-Qaida affiliated group funded by George Soros”. The White Helmets have never received funding from George Soros or any of his foundations.\n\nSome of the most vocal sceptics of the UN’s investigation include the blogger Vanessa Beeley, the daughter of a former British diplomat who visited Syria for the first time in July 2016; a University of Sydney senior lecturer, Timothy Anderson, who described the April chemical attack as a “hoax”; and Eva Bartlett, a Canadian writer and activist who said the White Helmets staged rescues using recycled victims – a claim that’s been debunked by Snopes and Channel 4 News.\n\n“They are basically excusing the inexcusable,” said Lucas.\n\n“They have a range of websites that will publish whatever nonsense and Russia Today will have them on TV,” he added.\n\nThe Russian strategy has been very successful at shaping the online conversation about the White Helmets. By gaming the social media algorithms with a flood of content, boosted by bots, sock puppet accounts and a network of agitators, propagandists are able to create a “manufactured consensus” that gives legitimacy to fringe views. Even Russia’s official channels, such as its UK embassy Twitter accounts, post memes discrediting the organisation.\n\nRussian Embassy, UK (@RussianEmbassy) Russia welcomes #Oscars award for “White Helmets” film. Indeed, they are actors serving an agenda, not rescuers. #OscarMistake pic.twitter.com/RsQesgZ4Te\n\n“If you scroll through tweets about the White Helmets, pretty much every other conversation is equating them with Isis, calling them terrorists. It looks like they are the bad guys,” said Sam Woolley, who studies computational propaganda at the University of Oxford.\n\n“It’s all part of an effort to delegitimise western efforts to stabilise Syria,” he said.\n\nHis colleague Samantha Bradshaw adds: “The more confusion there is, the easier it is to manipulate people.”\n\nThe research that shows the link\n\nThe Guardian spoke to several researchers studying the spread of disinformation and propaganda online who have found evidence of a targeted Russian influence campaign against the White Helmets.\n\nFil Menczer, a computer science professor at Indiana University, has developed a tool called Hoaxy to chart the spread of misinformation online. Searching for “White Helmets” reveals a handful of sources generated hundreds of stories about the organisation. “It’s like a factory,” he said.\n\nThe same handful of people are quoted as “experts” in articles that are repackaged and interlinked to create a body of content whose conspiracy claims gain a semblance of legitimacy.\n\nThe analytics firm Graphika has spent years analysing a range of Russian disinformation campaigns including those around the Macron leaks and the Russian doping scandal. In research commissioned by the human rights group the Syria Campaign, it found that the patterns in the online network of the 14,000 Twitter users talking about the White Helmets looked “very similar” and included many known pro-Kremlin troll accounts, some of which were closed down as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the US election. Other accounts appeared to generate more than 150 tweets per day (more than 70 is seen by scholars studying bots as suspicious).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Graphika map of the online conversation about the White Helmets. Photograph: Graphika\n\nGraphika also found evidence of coordination of timing and messaging around significant events in the news cycle relating to the White Helmets.\n\nSeparately, both Graphika and Menczer’s Hoaxy tool identify Beeley, the British blogger, as among the most influential disseminators of content about the White Helmets.\n\nTheir findings also correlate with work done by Kate Starbird from the University of Washington in Seattle, who asserts that Beeley and the alternative news site 21st Century Wire have dominated the Twitter conversation about White Helmets over the last few months, along with Sputnik and RT.com.\n\nKate Starbird (@katestarbird) Created a domain network graph for “white helmets” tweets May-Aug 2017. These are websites connected by users (who tweet to both). pic.twitter.com/5j0YkmF7D1\n\nBeeley frequently criticises the White Helmets in her role as editor of the website 21st Century Wire, set up by Patrick Henningsen, who is also a former editor at Infowars.com.\n\nIn 2016, Beeley had a two-hour meeting with Assad in Damascus as part of a US Peace Council delegation, which she described on Facebook as her “proudest moment”. She was also invited to Moscow to report on the “dirty war in Syria”; there, she met senior Russian officials including the deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, and Maria Zakharova, director of information and press at Russia’s foreign ministry.\n\nThe mannequin challenge\n\nTo understand the propaganda machine in action, you only have to look at what happened when the White Helmets posted their version of the mannequin challenge, a viral internet video trend where people would film themselves frozen mid-action. The rescue group filmed themselves in a staged rescue and shared the video on social media with the hashtag #MannequinChallenge.\n\nThe video, posted in November 2016 by the Revolutionary Forces of Syria Media Office, was immediately stripped of its context and reshared as evidence that the organisation uses “crisis actors” in staged rescues designed to make the Russian and Syrian armies look bad.\n\nms_knowital (@ms_knowital) Here is the White Helmets caught faking a rescue after a fake attack. https://t.co/T8xzX6kKtM\n\nOne Twitter user, retweeted hundreds of times, stated: “Unbelievable! Must watch video showing White Helmets fakery.”\n\nRT reported on the incident, including some of the tweets, and cited Beeley as an independent researcher asserting that the video fuelled suspicion around the “already questionable credibility” of the organisation. The following day Beeley wrote a story on 21st Century Wire in which she argued that the video caused “widespread doubt, even among diehard supporters, as to the veracity of their much edited slick video reports”.\n\nThe White Helmets later issued an apology, saying they had hoped the viral video would create a connection between the horror or Syria and the outside world, but acknowledged it was an “error of judgement”..\n\n“It was a stupid thing to do,” said Eliot Higgins, founder of the investigative reporting collective Bellingcat, “but it was then completely misused by people who have an agenda.”\n\nA year on and the White Helmets’ mannequin challenge video is still widely circulated as evidence that they stage rescues.\n\nThere have, however, been isolated rogue actors within the White Helmets who are used to discredit the entire group. One former White Helmet was fired after he was filmed assisting armed militants in disposing of the mutilated corpses of pro-Assad fighters, and others have been photographed with guns despite marketing themselves as unarmed. There is also footage of White Helmets taking a body away from an execution carried out by rebel militants, which critics claim shows they are “assisting” executions.\n\n“These are isolated incidents at the volunteer level – there has never been any kind of incident involving anyone in the leadership,” added Saleh, the White Helmets leader, looking down at his phone as he received a breaking news notification about a British politician resigning over sexual harassment allegations. “No one is saying that the government of the UK is a predatory organisation just because of this one incident.”\n\nMeanwhile, Beeley’s influence continues. In April 2017, she gave a talk at a conference alongside ministers in Assad’s cabinet (who spoke via video conference) titled “White Helmets: Fact or Fantasy?” Her briefing paper and slides on the topic were then submitted to the UN security council and UN general assembly by the Russian government as “evidence” against the White Helmets.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The White Helmets have been credited with saving thousands of lives. Photograph: Depo Photo/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n“These leaked documents offer cast-iron proof that the Russian government is doing what it can to elevate Vanessa Beeley as a key player in its propaganda campaign,” said James Sadri, executive director of the Syria Campaign. “A blogger for a 9/11 truther website who only visited Syria for the first time last year should not be taken seriously as an impartial expert on the conflict.”\n\nThe Guardian contacted Beeley several times asking for comment and she declined to respond to specific queries, saying that the questions put to her were “a disgrace” containing “no relevant facts and are reminiscent of a McCarthyite interrogation”.\n\nThe Guardian also contacted Eva Bartlett, who said she had “no interest in participating in your quite evidently already-decided ‘story’ (an odd term for a journalist to use for an article)”.\n\nShortly after the requests for comment, Beeley appeared on a 40-minute-long YouTube programme in which she discussed the emailed requests for comment and criticised the Guardian’s coverage of Syria, alleging “faux reporting” based on footage provided by “al-Qaida affiliates” the White Helmets. Beeley said that the “majority consensus” was that the White Helmets were a fraudulent terrorist organisation.\n\n• This article was amended on 21 December 2017.

"Bus seats mistaken for burqas by members of anti-immigrant group\nA Norwegian anti-immigrant group has been roundly ridiculed after members apparently mistook a photograph of six empty bus seats posted on its Facebook page for a group of women wearing burqas.\n\n“Tragic”, “terrifying” and “disgusting” were among the comments posted by members of the closed Fedrelandet viktigst, or “Fatherland first”, group beneath the photograph, according to screenshots on the Norwegian news website Nettavisen.\n\nOther members of the 13,000-strong group, for people “who love Norway and appreciate what our ancestors fought for”, wondered whether the non-existent passengers might be carrying bombs or weapons beneath their clothes. “This looks really scary,” wrote one. “Should be banned. You can’t tell who’s underneath. Could be terrorists.”\n\nFurther comments read: “Ghastly. This should never happen,” “Islam is and always will be a curse,” “Get them out of our country – frightening times we are living in,” and: “I thought it would be like this in the year 2050, but it is happening NOW,” according to thelocal.no and other media.\n\nThe photograph, found on the internet, was posted “for a joke” last week by Johan Slåttavik, who has since described himself as “Norway’s worst web troll and proud of it”, beneath a question asking the group: “What do people think of this?”\n\nSlåttavik told Nettavisen and Norway’s TV2 he wanted to “highlight the difference between legitimate criticism of immigration and blind racism”, and was “interested to see how people’s perceptions of an image are influenced by how others around them react. I ended up having a good laugh.”\n\nIt went viral in Norway after Sindre Beyer, a former Labour party MP who said he has been following Fatherland first for some time, published 23 pages of screenshots of the group’s outraged comments.\n\n“What happens when a photo of some empty bus seats is posted to a disgusting Facebook group, and nearly everyone thinks they see a bunch of burqas?” he asked in a post shared more than 1,800 times.\n\n\n\nThe comments suggested the vast majority of the anti-immigrant group’s members saw the photo as evidence of the ongoing “Islamification” of Norway, although a small number pointed out it was in fact a picture of bus seats. One warned the group was making itself look ridiculous.\n\nBeyer told Nettavisen: “I’m shocked at how much hate and fake news is spread [on the Fedrelandet viktigst page]. So much hatred against empty bus seats certainly shows that prejudice wins out over wisdom.”\n\nThe head of Norway’s Antiracist Centre, Rune Berglund Steen, told the site that people plainly “see what they want to see – and what these people want to see are dangerous Muslims”.\n\nNorway recently became the latest European country to propose restrictions on the wearing of burqas and niqabs, tabling a law that will bar them from kindergartens, schools and universities. France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria all restrict full-face veils in some public places.\n\n\n\nThe country’s minority government, a coalition of the centre-right Conservatives and the populist Progress party that faces elections next month, said in June it was confident it would find opposition support for the move.\n\nPer Sandberg, then acting immigration and integration minister, told a press conference that face-covering garments such as the niqab or burqa “do not belong in Norwegian schools. The ability to communicate is a basic value.”","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/02/bus-seats-mistaken-burqas-anti-immigrant-group-norwegian","1501646400.0"
"60 Minutes investigates hidden motors and pro cycling\nThe following script is from “Enhancing the Bike,” which aired on Jan. 29, 2017. Bill Whitaker is the correspondent. Michael Rey and Oriana Zill de Granados, producers.\n\nThe sport of cycling is notorious for its culture of cheating—made most famous by the rise and fall of Lance Armstrong and his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Now when cycling hopes to be cleansed of the dopers there’s a surprising new twist—riders enhancing the bike’s performance. Some professional racers aren’t putting steroids and blood boosters in their veins they’re hiding motors in their bike frames. We followed a lead to Budapest, Hungary, and met an engineer who said he built the first secret bike motor back in 1998. And he told us motors have been used in the Tour de France. Our story tonight is not about the latest drugs the riders are using to cheat…it’s all about enhancing the bike.\n\nBill Whitaker: Where is the motor in here?\n\nStefano Varjas: It’s in here.\n\nIn a bike shop in Budapest, Hungary, we met Istvan Varjas. Stefano, as he’s known, is a former cyclist, a businessman and a scientist. His most important invention he placed inside this bike. The frame is fitted with a small motor he designed. Add to it a lithium battery that powers it and a secret button that he installed.\n\nCBS News\n\nStefano Varjas: This is first speed.\n\nBill Whitaker: Uh. Huh.\n\nStefano Varjas: Try to keep the pace.\n\nBill Whitaker: Wow!\n\nThe sound is mostly the chain and the wheels. He said you can’t hear it on the road and all of his motor designs use brushless motors and military-grade metal alloys.\n\nBill Whitaker: And how does this work?\n\nThis is now the latest version of his hidden motor design.\n\nBill Whitaker: Unbelievable…\n\nIt can be connected to a heart rate monitor by remote control. When a riders heart beat gets too high it sends a signal for the motor to kick in.\n\nWe took his hidden motors for some test rides up in the hills above Budapest.\n\nBill Whitaker: This is like I’m on flat ground.\n\nCBS News\n\nIt was hard to believe it’s real until I put my feet on the pedals. Harder to believe when I took them off the pedals…\n\nBill Whitaker: “Hello.”\n\nAnd still beat the local talent. As you can tell it’s not like a moped. There’s no exhaust pipe or revving engine noise. It’s designed to give a short but powerful boost to the rider’s own effort.\n\nBill Whitaker: So this is a lower gear or a higher gear?\n\nStefano Varjas sells complete motorized bikes to wealthy recreational riders for about $20,000. But we went to Budapest to find out who else might have bought a silent, hidden motor for a racing bike.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you know, are professionals using bikes like these on a professional tour?\n\nStefano Varjas: This one, no. This on --\n\nBill Whitaker: But bikes with motors?\n\nStefano Varjas: Yes. I know-- I know this.\n\nBill Whitaker: They are?\n\nStefano Varjas: They use, yes.\n\nSuspicions of hidden motors are fueled by videos of riders crashing in races. This bike seems to move by itself without the rider.\n\nAnd the first time anyone suspected they were looking at a motor was in 2010 when a famed Swiss racer sped ahead of the pack at unnatural speeds.\n\nThese riders all denied they were using motors and no one had ever been caught until last year. Race officials suspended this Belgian rider after they found a motor inside her spare bike.\n\nJean-Pierre Verdy is the former testing director for the French Anti-Doping Agency who investigated doping in the Tour de France for 20 years.\n\nBill Whitaker: Have there been motors used in the Tour de France?\n\nJean-Pierre Verdy: Yes, of course. It’s been the last three to four years when I was told about the use of the motors. And in 2014, they told me there are motors. And they told me, there’s a problem. By 2015, everyone was complaining and I said, something’s got to be done.\n\nVerdy said he’s been disturbed by how fast some riders are going up the mountains. As a doping investigator, he relied for years on informants among the team managers and racers in the peloton, the word for the pack of riders. These people told Jean-Pierre Verdy that about 12 racers used motors in the 2015 Tour de France.\n\nBill Whitaker: The bikers who use motors, what do you think of them and what they’re doing to cycling?\n\nJean-Pierre Verdy:They’re hurting their sport. But human nature is like that. Man has always tried to find that magic potion.\n\nHe now thinks that magic potion is a motor like the one designed by Stefano Varjas.\n\nBill Whitaker: Are you selling your motors to pro peloton now?\n\nStefano Varjas: Never, ever.\n\nBill Whitaker: Never, ever?\n\nStefano Varjas: Never, ever. But I don’t know, if a grandfather came and buy a bike and after it’s go to finishing his grandson who is racing, it’s not my problem.\n\nBill Whitaker: It sounds like plausible deniability, which means my fingerprints aren’t on this when it ends up in the bike of a professional. I just sold it to a client. What the client did with it--\n\nStefano Varjas: Is their problem.\n\nBill Whitaker: --I don’t know--\n\nStefano Varjas: It’s not my problem.\n\nBill Whitaker: So if someone came to you and said directly, “I wanna use your invention to cheat. I’ll pay you a lot of money for it,” would you sell it to them?\n\nStefano Varjas: If the money is big, why not?\n\nHe said he got his first big money in 1998 when a friend saw his hidden motor prototype and thought he could sell it to a professional racer.\n\nBill Whitaker: So your friend said, “With all this doping going on, you’re-- you’re crazy not to try to sell your invention--”\n\nStefano Varjas: Exactly. And--\n\nBill Whitaker: “--to these professional--”\n\nStefano Varjas: He proposed me--\n\nBill Whitaker: “--racers”?\n\nStefano Varjas: He proposed me, “Give me this bike and I fix it up, your life.” And it’s happened.\n\nHe told us his friend found a buyer in 1998 and Stefano swears he has no idea who it was. He gave us this bank record that shows that he had about $2 million at the time. We also know that he spent time in jail for not paying a substantial tax bill in Hungary. He said whoever paid him all that money wanted an exclusive deal—he couldn’t work on the motor, sell it or talk about it for 10 years.\n\nBill Whitaker: And you were OK with that?\n\nStefano Varjas: For 10 years. $2 millions-- if you are in Hungary, if you live in Hungary, if you-- they offer you $2 million to don’t do nothing--\n\nBill Whitaker: You couldn’t refuse it?\n\nStefano Varjas: Can you refuse it? I don’t think.\n\nBill Whitaker: So you believe that hidden motors have been used by professional cyclists since as far back as 1998?\n\nStefano Varjas: I think, yes.\n\nIn France, where cycling is a religion, the newspaper Le Monde said this past December that the timeline of Stefano’s story might implicate Lance Amstrong. Armstrong won his first of seven Tour de France victories in 1999, just a year after Stefano Varjas’ said he sold his first motor. Armstrong denied to the paper ever meeting Stefano in person or putting a motor in his bike.\n\nWe asked Armstrong too through his lawyer and he denied ever using a motor and declined an interview.\n\nCBS News\n\nWe contacted Armstrong’s former teammate Tyler Hamilton who has admitted to being part of all the chemical doping by members of the U.S. Postal team. And Tyler told us he never knew of any motors on the team back then.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the motors existed as far back as 1998, Stefano Varjas suggested to us that we find a carbon fiber 1999 U.S. Postal Service team bike, the same bike the U.S. Postal team used in the 1999 Tour de France. We bought this bike off the Internet and he installed a motor based on his first design into the bike. He charged us $12,000, saying that covered his costs for the parts and labor.\n\nWe then asked Hamilton to test out the bike.\n\nBill Whitaker: You could feel the difference?\n\nTyler Hamilton: Oh yeah, oh, yeah. It’s not super obvious. You know, you-- all of a sudden, you’re just like, “Ah.”\n\nBill Whitaker: It seems easier?\n\nTyler Hamilton: It feels a little bit smoother, yeah. Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: So you could see how somebody could get away with it?\n\nTyler Hamilton: I could see how teams are doing it. Yeah. I could.\n\nThe motor gives a limited boost of power for about 20 minutes. Tyler Hamilton said that much motorized assistance during a race on a mountain road could be a game changer for a professional rider.\n\nBill Whitaker: What kind of benefit could this motor give a cyclist?\n\nTyler Hamilton: That’s the difference between winning and losing for sure. For sure.\n\n“I guess we shoulda known this was coming, you know? ‘Cause, I mean, there’s more pressure in today’s cycling world than ever to win.” Tyler Hamilton\n\nFew riders know that better than Tyler Hamilton. When he spoke to 60 Minutes in 2011, he was one of the first to talk openly about chemical doping in the sport. He said riders have always looked for ways to stay ahead of the authorities.\n\nTyler Hamilton: They’d find-- you know, for a while, they didn’t have an EPO test. EPO increases your red blood cell production. When the new tests came out, you’d figure out new ways around them.\n\nCBS News\n\nTyler Hamilton: I guess we shoulda known this was coming, you know? ‘Cause, I mean, there’s more pressure in today’s cycling world than ever to win.\n\nDuring this car ride in Hungary with Stefano Varjas we listened as he talked on the phone with one of his clients about delivering some new motorized bikes. He said he was speaking to this man, Dr. Michele Ferrari. Ferrari is the man behind the doping programs of Lance Armstrong and other top cyclists. He has been banned from the sport of cycling.\n\nStill Stefano Varjas told us that Ferrari bought bikes with hidden motors in the past three years. We spoke to Dr. Ferrari by phone and he denied buying motorized bikes from Stefano but said he has tested one.\n\nThree-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond and his wife Kathy first learned about hidden motors in 2014 when Greg met Stefano Varjas in Paris and took a test ride. Greg was outspoken about chemical doping and now has the same level of concern about the motors.\n\nCBS News\n\nGreg LeMond: I’ve watched-- last couple years-- and I’m going I know the motor’s still in the sport and--\n\nBill Whitaker: You know it is still in the sport?\n\nGreg LeMond: Yeah. Yeah. There’s always a few bad apples and-- because it’s a lotta money.\n\nHe is so concerned about it that while working as a broadcaster at the Tour de France he and his wife worked secretly with the French police investigating the motors. His best source it turns out was Stefano Varjas.\n\nKathy LeMond: I asked Stefano if he would please come and talk to the French police.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did he? Is he cooperating with the police?\n\nKathy LeMond: Completely.\n\nStefano said he told the French police that just before the 2015 Tour de France he again sold motorized bikes to an unknown client through a middleman. He said he was directed to deliver the bikes to a locked storage room in the town of Beaulieu Sur Mer, France.\n\nStefano Varjas told us that in addition to the motors in the bike frames, he’s designed a motor that can be hidden inside the hub of the back wheel seen here in a video he gave us.\n\nKathy LeMond: Stefano had said, “Weigh the wheels. You’ll find the wheels. The wheels are in the peloton.”\n\nAccording to Varjas the enhanced wheels weigh about 800 grams—or 1.7 pounds more than normal wheels.\n\nBill Whitaker: You could detect it by weight?\n\nGreg LeMond: Yeah. Cycling weight is everything. Your body, your bike. If your bike weighs a kilo more, you would never race on it.\n\n“This is curable. This is fixable. I don’t trust it until they figure out how to take the motor out. I won’t trust any victories of the Tour de France.” Greg LeMond\n\nIn the 2015 Tour de France, bikes in the peloton were weighed before one of the time trial stages. French authorities told us the British Team Sky was the only team with bikes heavier than the rest—each bike weighed about 800 grams more. A spokesman for Team Sky said that during a time trial stage bikes might be heavier to allow for better aerodynamic performance. He said the team has never used mechanical assistance and that the bikes were checked and cleared by the sports governing body.\n\nA heavy bike doesn’t prove anything on its own but to Greg LeMond the weight difference should have set off alarm bells. In this case, sources told us, the sport’s governing body would not allow French investigators to remove the Team Sky wheels and weigh them separately to determine if the wheels were enhanced. LeMond said not enough is being done by the International Cycling Union to prevent cheating with motors.\n\nGreg LeMond: This is curable. This is fixable. I don’t trust it until they figure out how to take the motor out.

Less than a year later, she’s going back to prison.\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama speaks to reporters during a July 2015 visit to the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution outside Oklahoma City. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nCarol Denise Richardson was sentenced to life in prison in 2006. Her crime? Possessing 50 grams or more of cocaine. Prosecutors said she intended to distribute the drugs. But what she had was crack cocaine and, like many in prison, she claimed the chunks of cocaine were to feed her own addiction — that she had no intention to share or sell them.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was president, he agreed with criminal justice reform advocates who argued current laws unjustly treated those found with crack cocaine the same as those caught with more expensive, but less bulky, pure form of powder cocaine. Since prosecution and sentencing standards are based on weight, a handful of rocks of crack could result in much harsher punishment.\n\nBased on this argument, Obama chose to grant clemency to a record number of prisoners who had committed nonviolent drug-related offenses. In 2016, Richardson became one of them. But now, she has been ordered to return to federal prison after violating the terms of her supervised release, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas said Thursday.\n\n'The president has taken great pains in giving positive reinforcement to those he's given clemency,' Valerie Jarrett, senior advisor to President Obama, told The Post's Sari Horwitz at a Washington Post event about incarceration and reentry into society. (Washington Post Live)\n\nRichardson, a 49-year-old resident of Texas City, was originally convicted in 2006 for “conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine as well as two counts of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base.” At the time, U.S. District Judge Keith P. Ellison sentenced her to life in federal prison, noting that she had an extensive criminal history.\n\nRichardson had already served about a decade of her life sentence when she received a reprieve last year, under an agreement that her release would be supervised for 10 years. For Richardson and hundreds of other nonviolent drug offenders granted clemency, the truncated prison sentence was a rare opportunity to reenter society. During his two terms in office, Obama commuted a total of 1,715 prison sentences, more than any other president in history.\n\nRichardson was released from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons on July 28, 2016.\n\nHowever, on April 13, less than a year after her release, Richardson was arrested for theft in Pasadena, Tex., a Houston suburb.\n\n[Obama grants final 330 commutations to nonviolent drug offenders]\n\nAccording to acting U.S. attorney Abe Martinez, Richardson also violated four other terms of her release, including a failure to report any “law enforcement contact” to her probation officer within 72 hours.\n\n“She has also failed to maintain regular contact with the U.S. Probation Office and failed to report that she had been terminated from her employment with Home Health Providers for abandoning her position,” Martinez said in a statement. “She also failed to report a change in her residence. In fact, as of May 15, 2017, attempts to reach her were unsuccessful, and her whereabouts were unknown.”\n\nRichardson was finally located and arrested May 31, Martinez said. In a hearing Thursday, Ellison — the same judge who had sentenced Richardson to life in federal prison in 2006 — told her he was disappointed that she had wasted “the extremely rare opportunity she was given,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\nEllison ordered Richardson to return to federal prison for 14 months; afterward, she will be placed on supervised release for five years.\n\n“This defendant was literally given a second chance to become a productive member of society and has wasted it,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Ted Imperato said in a statement after the hearing. “She has clearly shown a willful disregard for the law and must face the consequences for her crimes and actions.”\n\nMark Anthony Diaz, an attorney for Richardson, did not immediately return messages Saturday morning. Diaz told the Houston Chronicle that Richardson’s theft was for $60 worth of laundry detergent that she was going to sell for drug money and that she cried at her hearing.\n\nDiaz said Richardson’s addiction to crack cocaine was why she relapsed and fell out of touch with her support system after her release, and he asked to know why she had not received drug treatment in prison, the Chronicle reported.\n\nThe CAN-DO Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for clemency for nonviolent drug offenders — including that of Richardson while she was imprisoned — echoed those concerns.\n\n[Sessions weighs return to harsher punishments for low-level drug crimes]\n\n“We are very concerned to hear that Carol Richardson has been sent back to prison for various probation violations that appear to stem from her drug addiction that has gone untreated,” the group said in a statement. “The system has failed Carol, yet again. It will be easy for some to point a finger at Carol and justify their support of harsh mandatory sentences as a necessity to keep people locked up, when we feel Carol’s current situation is proof that we desperately need to overhaul our current drug policy that treats addiction as a criminal issue, rather than a medical issue.”\n\nWhile in prison, Richardson had been in contact with CAN-DO to make a case for her clemency. She detailed the circumstances that led to her life sentence, and said she had admitted herself into rehab in March 2005 and was getting treatment when she was indicted.\n\n“I was a drug user and do not consider myself a drug dealer because I never profited from the sell of drugs,” Richardson wrote in a letter to the group. “I was convicted on testimony alone — no proof.”\n\nShe also noted that, among her four male co-defendants, including her husband, she received the harshest sentence for being present at two drug “buys,” despite never receiving money.\n\nCAN-DO supported and prioritized Richardson’s case, placing her on its list of “Top 25 Women” seeking clemency, because the group felt she had been “tossed into the indictment, not because they profited from the drug trade, but because they were feeding a habit or in a relationship with a man involved in the drug trade.”\n\n“Often, when the major dealers are arrested, they are offered sentence reductions if they will provide ‘substantial assistance’ and provide more names that can be added to the indictment,” the group says on its website. “Often, that will include anyone associated even slightly to the drug activity, including women who may have been a courier in exchange for drugs, or given very little money to feed their habit.\n\n“Tragically, Carol fell into this category.”\n\n[In Trump’s ‘ruthless’ vow, experts see a return to the days of the drug war]\n\nAmy Povah, the founder of CAN-DO, told The Washington Post that, unlike some others the group has worked with, Richardson fell out of touch after she was released from prison.\n\n“Most people do,” Povah said. “Carol was a little more introverted.”\n\nShe said the group does not keep statistics on the recidivism rate of those who had been granted clemency — beyond trying to keep in touch with former prisoners — but said that Richardson’s case was “extremely rare.” Povah said she had only known of one other person, Robert M. Gill of San Antonio, who had been returned to prison after being granted a second chance under Obama.\n\nEarlier this year, Gill was arrested after being caught with cocaine and trying to flee from officers, according to the San Antonio Express News. Povah told The Post she felt Gill’s case was “more alarming … whereas it seems (Carol Richardson’s) behavior and lack of success is related to probation violations, many of which stem from her addiction.”\n\nAccording to Povah, Richardson had always been forthcoming about her drug addiction, but was never able to take a 500-hour drug program in prison. She also likely had little assistance with medical issues, Povah said.\n\nLike Carol, most people who get life sentences, upon release “literally have NO FUNDS, no home, no fruits from the drug trade that the feds wants the public to believe they were profiting from,” Povah wrote in an email. “Carol is a self admitted drug addict who used ‘daily,’ and tried to get help but never completed the program due to her addiction. The actual drug dealers in her case cut deals and are were back on the street in a few short years — so why are we hyper focused on Carol’s recidivism[?] Hopefully, her case can be used to understand what is wrong with our current drug war policy from start to finish.”\n\nNorman Brown, of Hyattsville, Md., was granted clemency by former President Barack Obama in July 2015. In 1993 at age 22, Brown was sentenced to life in prison for cocaine distribution.

"Kim Jong Un's Missiles May Be Final Nail for Japan's Pacifism\nBreaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nTOKYO — The two ballistic missiles that North Korea fired over Japan in the past three weeks sent ordinary Japanese citizens scrambling for cover, rattled financial markets and shocked a region long accustomed to a tense peace.\n\nBut amid the crisis, one man’s stock appears to be rising. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s public approval ratings have surged along with his prospects for revising the country's pacifist constitution, acquiring more powerful weapons and confronting China’s rising regional clout.\n\nWhile Abe hopes his growing stature will allow him to bolster Japan’s military in the face of multiple threats beyond North Korea, he risks alarming neighbors who have not forgotten the horrors of its World War II-era expansion.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Saki Tsukada / Kyodo News via AP file\n\n“In a sense, it’s as if China and North Korea are supporting Abe’s popularity,” said Yukihisa Fujita, a lawmaker with the opposition Democratic Party.\n\nFujita worries that Abe’s moves will cause “unnecessary mistrust and tensions, not only by governments but also people in other countries.”\n\nAbe had set a deadline to revise the constitution by 2020 — the year Tokyo will host the Olympic Games — to formalize Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as an actual military. While a mostly symbolic move, it's one that feeds red meat to his conservative base.\n\nAbe’s popularity has proved unstable in the past: He distanced himself from his own deadline when his approval ratings dipped over the summer and some analysts attribute his recent burst of popularity to scandals among his opponents.\n\n'There is right now a one-sided arms race that China is winning' 'There is right now a one-sided arms race that China is winning'\n\nBut he’s nevertheless moving ahead with plans to purchase more advanced weaponry capable of offensive operations, such as Tomahawk cruise missiles and the first batch of 42 advanced F-35s fighter jets ordered from the United States.\n\nHe’s also beefing up Japan’s defenses by adding a land-based missile defense system called Aegis Ashore to its sea-borne capabilities.\n\nAll of this will be paid for by the country’s most sustained stretch of military funding increases in a generation.\n\nRelated: U.S. Bombers Join Flurry of Drills After Kim's Latest Test\n\nAbe has pumped up Japan’s military budget every year since he’s been in office. For 2018, he’s asking for 2.5 percent more for the Ministry of Defense — a princely total budget of $48.2 billion.\n\nTo Abe supporters, such ambitions smack of realism rather than militarism: Given the threat posed by North Korea, any nation would want the option of pre-emptive self-defense.\n\nA photo released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is described as showing Kim Jong Un during the launch of a medium-to-long range strategic ballistic missile. The image was issued on Saturday. KCNA / EPA\n\nJapanese and American hawks have long argued that Tokyo's military spending is too low relative to its more militaristic neighbors.\n\nAfter all, Japan’s SDF already walks and talks like a real military. With nearly 250,000 standing soldiers, Asia’s most powerful navy and some of its most advanced military technology, Japan already ranks among the world’s top 10 defense spenders.\n\n“We have a full-fledged military, but we are saying that these are self-defense forces, that these are quasi-military forces,” said Narushige Michishita, a Tokyo-based military analyst. “So it’s a big lie.”\n\nMichishita and other analysts reject the notion that more weapons for Japan would spark a regional arms race. They maintain Abe’s militarization will maintain the current balance of power rather than allowing Japan to yield ground to China.\n\n“There is right now a one-sided arms race that China is winning,” said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Japanese history at Temple University’s Tokyo campus.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/kim-jong-un-s-missiles-may-be-final-nail-pacifist-n802271","None"
"Garrison Keillor Accused Of 'Inappropriate Behavior,' Minnesota Public Radio Says\nGarrison Keillor Accused Of 'Inappropriate Behavior,' Minnesota Public Radio Says\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Baenen/AP Jeff Baenen/AP\n\nUpdated at 2:32 p.m. ET\n\nGarrison Keillor, the creator and former host of A Prairie Home Companion, has been accused of inappropriate behavior with someone who worked with him, according to Minnesota Public Radio, which has announced it is cutting ties with Keillor and his production company.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, the NPR member station says it learned of the allegations in October and has retained an outside law firm to investigate them. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nIn statements to the Minnesota Star Tribune, Keillor said that he 'put [his] hand on a woman's bare back' and alleged that he had been groped by dozens of female fans.\n\nKeillor, 75, no longer hosts A Prairie Home Companion, the show indelibly tied to his name. But he continues to produce The Writer's Almanac. Both shows are widely carried by public radio stations across the country.\n\nMPR says in its statement that the station and its owner, American Public Media, will no longer distribute Writer's Almanac and will stop rebroadcasting The Best Of A Prairie Home Companion. In addition, new episodes of A Prairie Home Companion — now hosted by Chris Thile — will be given a new name.\n\nThe allegations 'relate to Mr. Keillor's conduct while he was responsible for the production of A Prairie Home Companion,' MPR says. 'Based on what we currently know, there are no similar allegations involving other staff.'\n\n'Garrison Keillor has been an important part of the growth and success of MPR, and all of us in the MPR community are saddened by these circumstances,' Jon McTaggart, the president of MPR, said in that statement. 'While we appreciate the contributions Garrison has made to MPR and to all of public radio, we believe this decision is the right thing to do and is necessary to continue to earn the trust of our audiences, employees and supporters of our public service.'\n\nKeillor told The Associated Press that MPR cut ties with him over 'a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard.'\n\nThe radio personality later told the Star Tribune that he was not, in general, physically demonstrative, and that the incident that led to his firing involved touching a woman's bare skin. 'I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches,' he said. 'She recoiled. I apologized.'\n\n'If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I'd have at least a hundred dollars. So this is poetic irony of a high order,' Keillor later said.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Washington Post published an opinion column by Keillor in which he defended Sen. Al Franken, accused of forcibly kissing a radio host and groping another woman during a photo, against calls for his resignation.\n\n'On the flight home, in a spirit of low comedy, Al ogled Miss [Leeann] Tweeden and pretended to grab her and a picture was taken. Eleven years later, a talk show host in LA, she goes public, and there is talk of resignation. This is pure absurdity, and the atrocity it leads to is a code of public deadliness,' Keillor wrote. 'No kidding.'\n\nKeillor, who was never part of MPR's newsroom, openly supports Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and has personally donated thousands of dollars to Franken's campaigns, according to FEC data.\n\nBut his column on Franken was not the first time Keillor has pushed back against criticism of sexual harassment.\n\nHoward Mortman, the communications director of C-SPAN, notes that in 1994 Keillor spoke at the National Press Club in D.C. and said, among other things, ' A world in which there is no sexual harassment at all is a world in which there will not be any flirtation.' The crowd was quiet.\n\n'A world without thieves at all will not have entrepreneurs,' Keillor said next, and at that, the crowd laughed.\n\nAllegations of misconduct — specifically, of sexual harassment — have caused a number of prominent men to lose their jobs in recent weeks, including two top editors at NPR.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, NBC News announced that longtime Today host Matt Lauer had been fired over a complaint about 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/29/567241644/garrison-keillor-accused-of-inappropriate-behavior-minnesota-public-radio-says","1511931600.0"
"North Korean Nuclear Test Draws U.S. Warning of ‘Massive Military Response’\nTaken literally, such a policy would be tantamount to demanding a stoppage of any Chinese oil to North Korea, essentially an attempt to freeze out the country this winter and bring whatever industry it has to a halt.\n\nThe Chinese would almost certainly balk; they have never been willing to take steps that might lead to the collapse of the North Korean regime, no matter how dangerous its behavior, for fear that South Korean and American troops would occupy the country and move directly to the Chinese border.\n\nBeyond that, the economic disruption of ending all trade with China would be so huge inside the United States that Mr. Trump’s aides declined on Sunday to discuss the implications.\n\nAfter meeting with Mr. Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emerged to warn North Korea that “any threat to the United States or its territory, including Guam or our allies, will be met with a massive military response.” But Mr. Mattis, in a terse statement delivered on the White House driveway with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., also offered a word of reassurance to the North’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un.\n\n“We are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea,” he said. “But as I said, we have many options to do so.”\n\nThe statement echoed past comments by the defense secretary as well as a warning issued by President George W. Bush after North Korea’s first atomic test, in 2006. In that statement, Mr. Bush also said North Korea would be held responsible if it ever exported any of its nuclear weapons technology to other nations or to terrorists.\n\nCHINA 100 Miles Nuclear test site Punggye-ri NORTH KOREA Sea of Japan East Sea Pyongyang Seoul Yellow Sea SOUTH KOREA JAPAN Korea Strait\n\nStill, Mr. Mattis’s statement left open many questions. His formulation seemed to rule out the kind of “preventive war’’ that the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, warned last month might be necessary after the North tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in an effort to demonstrate that it could reach Los Angeles and beyond. Instead, Mr. Mattis seemed to be talking about “pre-emptive strikes,” which the United States might order if it determined that an attack seemed imminent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was no public discussion of pursuing a diplomatic opening to the North. Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson raised such a possibility two weeks ago, after a brief lull in North Korea’s testing. That statement turned out to be optimistic at best. The North has shown no interest in engaging with the United States unless the Americans end their military presence in the South.\n\nTo the contrary, the North Korean leader has tried to portray his nuclear program as unstoppable and nonnegotiable, posing by a picture of what the North’s official news agency on Sunday called a hydrogen bomb that could be fitted into the nose cone of the ICBMs tested last month. Experts warned that the weapon, while shaped like a hydrogen bomb, could well have been a mock-up or decoy, one of the many steps the North takes to make it appear more powerful than it truly is.\n\nOn Monday, South Korea’s army fired short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast in a simulated attack on North Korea’s nuclear test site, its military said in a statement. F-15K fighter jets also joined in the show of force, firing air-to-land missiles, it said.\n\nOnly hours earlier, Mr. Trump reacted to the North Korean test by lashing out at South Korea.\n\n“North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success,” he said. “South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!”\n\nMr. Trump appeared to be referring to the offers by South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, to enter into some kind of negotiations with the North that might lead to a renewal of the “Sunshine Policy,” an effort by some of his predecessors to lure the North into disarmament with economic engagement. Those efforts failed.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Moon said recently that he had obtained a promise from Washington that the United States would never take military action without Seoul’s approval — a commitment the Trump administration has never confirmed.\n\nMr. Trump’s undisguised swipe at the South for “appeasement” was certain to exacerbate fears that the United States might put it in danger. And it came only a day after Mr. Trump threatened a new rift in relations with suggestions that the United States might withdraw from a trade deal with South Korea — one that was intended to bolster the alliance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn response to Mr. Trump’s criticism, Mr. Moon’s office said it was working closely with Washington to exert “maximum sanctions and pressure.” But it also reiterated that the allies shared the understanding that the goal of these sanctions and pressure was to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He has conducted more than 80 missile tests since taking over the country. And four of the six nuclear tests have been on his watch.\n\nThis was the biggest, by far. The United States Geological Survey estimated that the tremor set off by the blast, detected at 12:36 p.m. at the Punggye-ri underground test site in northeastern North Korea, had a magnitude of 6.3.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe South Korean Defense Ministry’s estimate was much lower, at 5.7, but even that would mean a blast “five to six times” as powerful as the North’s last nuclear test, a year ago, said Lee Mi-sun, a senior analyst at the South Korean Meteorological Administration.\n\nThe South’s National Fire Agency, which operates an emergency hotline, said it had received 31 calls about buildings and the ground shaking, the first time that South Koreans had reported tremors after a North Korean nuclear detonation.\n\nThe blast was so powerful that the first tremor was followed by a second, weaker one minutes later, which the United States Geological Survey called a “collapse,” probably a cave-in at the North’s underground test site.\n\nCondemnation of the test came from around the world.\n\nChina, the North’s main ally and biggest trading partner, expressed “strong condemnation” of the test, according to Xinhua, the state news agency, but suggested no new action. Its leaders feel as stymied as their American counterparts, according to many China experts.\n\nThe test’s timing was a major embarrassment for President Xi Jinping of China, who on Sunday was hosting a summit meeting of the so-called BRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeter Hayes, director of the Nautilus Institute, a United States-based research group specializing in North Korea, said the test seemed intended to jolt Mr. Xi and convince him that he needed to persuade the United States to talk to North Korea.\n\nJapan requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, as it did earlier in the week after a missile test over Hokkaido, its northernmost island.\n\nIn Europe, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that North Korea “deserves absolute condemnation,” and a joint statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France said “the most recent provocation from Pyongyang reaches a new dimension.”\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said the test amounted to a “complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community.”\n\nThe timing of the test on Sunday was almost certainly no coincidence: It came during the American Labor Day weekend, and the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean government is next Saturday.\n\nIn the coming days, the government is expected to organize huge rallies to celebrate the bomb test and Mr. Kim’s leadership.\n\n“Pyongyang has a playbook of strategic provocations, throws off its adversaries through graduated escalation, and seeks maximum political impact by conducting weapons tests on major holidays,” said Lee Sung-yoon, a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.\n\nBut it also exaggerates its power. After its fourth nuclear test, in January 2016, North Korea claimed to have used a hydrogen bomb. Other countries dismissed the claim for lack of evidence, but experts have said that the North may have tested a “boosted” atomic bomb that used tritium, a common enhancement technique that produces a higher explosive yield.\n\nAnalysts noted that the device in the photo that the North released on Sunday — whether real or a mock-up — was shaped like a two-stage thermonuclear device. David Albright, president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, said he doubted the device was real, but he said there was strong evidence that the North had been working on thermonuclear weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The size of the seismic signal of the recent test suggests a significantly higher explosive yield than the fifth test,” Mr. Albright said. “Getting this high of a yield would likely require thermonuclear material in the device.” But he said he was “skeptical that this design has been miniaturized to fit reliably on a ballistic missile.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/world/asia/north-korea-tremor-possible-6th-nuclear-test.html","1504411200.0"
"NRKbeta site commenters must pass test before posting\n(CNN) How often do you read a headline online and race to the comment section, desperate to vent?\n\nIt may be natural to many, but it's exactly the type of behavior that NRKbeta , the technology section on the news website of Norway's public broadcasting network, is trying to stop.\n\nOn some stories, potential commenters must answer three simple multiple-choice questions about an article before they can post responses to it.\n\nOn a recent NRKbeta article about a new Facebook search tool , for example, readers have to answer these correctly questions before they can post a comment: Who developed Stalkscan? Should you be terrified of Stalkscan? When did Facebook Graph Search launch? Three options are given for each, and the answers can all be found in the story.\n\nThe site has few problems with its regular community of readers, NRKbeta editor Marius Arnesen told CNN.\n\n'But when we share our articles on the home page, they attract a lot of readers not familiar with the topics,' he said. 'They just read the headline, assume certain things and race to the comment field.\n\n'The aim is to make people take 30 seconds before they comment, to take the edge off.'\n\nThe initiative was launched three weeks ago. Arnesen admits that its success will be difficult to measure: 'Are fewer comments a sign of success? Better comments? How do you measure good/bad comments?'\n\nBut he said the initial reaction from the site's regular audience has been positive.\n\nOver the last few years, many news platforms, including CNN , have disabled the comment field entirely on some or all of their articles, choosing to encourage discussions on social media channels instead.\n\nLast year, tech site Engadget disabled its comment system for a week because 'so many of the replies' to stories dealing with topics such as gender, race or harassment were 'hateful, even threatening,' according to a statement posted on the website\n\nThe comment system was re-enabled soon afterward with a new series of safeguards, including in-line moderator tools and user profiles.\n\nOther sites are taking advantage of tools such as Civil Comments , which uses crowdsourced moderation, or Disqus , which uses ban lists and word filters to moderate reader comments.\n\nLike many other platforms, NRKbeta is committed to keeping comment fields open if at all possible.\n\n'We believe that you reading NRKbeta are at least as clever, and often smarter, than us who work here,' Arnesen wrote in a statement on the website in August . 'We believe in the idea that comments help to make the articles better by deepening, enriching and questioning the themes.'\n\nBut NRKbeta is one of very few sections on the NRK website to have any comment fields still open at all, according to Arnesen. 'Most of the comment fields on the rest of the site have been turned off for years,' he told CNN.\n\nWith this new tool, Arnesen said he hopes to reinvigorate reader engagement across the NRK platform. 'This could lead to us turning on comment fields elsewhere on the site,' he said.\n\nWhether it can halt the slow death of comment fields on sites across the Web, however, remains to be seen.","https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/02/europe/norway-tech-site-quiz/index.html","1488430800.0"

"After Irma, Florida prepares for days — and maybe weeks — without power\nCAPE CORAL, Fla. — Millions of Floridians grappled with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma on Wednesday, confronting a sweltering reality: More than 40 percent of Florida still lacked electricity, and for some of them, the lights might not come back on for days or even weeks.\n\n“We understand what it means to be in the dark,” said Robert Gould, vice president and chief communications officer for Florida Power and Light (FPL), the state’s largest utility. “We understand what it means to be hot and without air conditioning. We will be restoring power day and night.”\n\nBut, he acknowledged: “This is going to be a very uncomfortable time.”\n\nAcross the nation’s third most-populous state, that discomfort played out in homes that were silent without the usual thrum of perpetual air-conditioning. It meant refrigerators were unable to cool milk, laundry machines were unable to clean clothes and, for the particularly young and old, potential danger in a state where the temperatures can range from warm to stifling.\n\n[Irma’s final danger: Flooding in the Southeast]\n\nEven for those who had power, some also were struggling to maintain cellphone service or Internet access, sending Floridians into tree-riddled streets in an effort to spot a few precious bars of signal to contact loved ones.\n\n1 of 71 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Aftermath: Residents assess damage in the wake of Hurricane Irma View Photos The full extent of the damage caused by Irma, which destroyed homes and cut off power for many, is being determined.

Spencer Platt Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\n“It’s a mess, a real mess. The biggest issue is power,” said Bill Barnett, mayor of Naples, on Florida’s Gulf Coast. “We just need power. It’s 92 degrees and the sun is out and it’s smoking out there.”\n\nUtility companies made progress as they undertook a massive recovery effort, restoring power to some. At its peak, the Department of Homeland Security said about 15 million Floridians — an astonishing three out of four state residents — lacked power.\n\nBy early Wednesday, state officials gradually lowered the number of customers without power, dropping it to about 4.4 million from 6.5 million on Monday. Because each power company account can represent multiple people, the sheer number of residents without electricity was massive: Going by the Homeland Security estimates, at one point Irma had knocked out power to one out of every 22 Americans.\n\nIt would take some time before all of them had electricity again. Duke Energy Florida said it would restore power to most customers by Sunday, a week after Irma made its first landfall in Florida. Some harder-hit areas could take longer due to the rebuilding effort.\n\nGould said that FPL, which powers about half of the state, expected customers on Florida’s East Coast to have power back by the end of the weekend. People in western Florida, closer to Irma’s path, should have it back by Sept. 22. That estimate does not include places with severe flooding or tornado damage, he said, and those areas could also face a longer wait to be able to switch on the lights.\n\nFloridians reacted to the outages eclectically. Some welcomed the absence of perpetual air-conditioners. Others flocked to their local malls for a respite from the heat.\n\n“There’s no power at home, so we might as well just stay here and stay cool,” Amanda Brack, who was with her son, Gavin, said while walking through a Brookstone at the Galleria shopping mall in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nBlake Deerhog had walked to the mall from his powerless and steamy apartment in nearby Victoria Park, trekking some 20 minutes in the stifling heat and humidity after he Googled and learned it would be open.\n\n“This is definitely better than being back at my apartment,” he said, adding that he planned to spend the afternoon there.\n\n[Florida Keys are battered but bouncing back]\n\nThe outages also caused rising alarm in some places. Here in Cape Coral, an assisted care facility for patients with dementia and memory impairment that sheltered in place during the storm went without power for three days, as elderly patients suffered in the rising heat.\n\nThe southwest Florida facility, Cape Coral Shores, had 20 patients stay during the storm as part of an agreement with state and local officials because the emergency shelters it would normally use were both evacuated as Irma approached. Power at the facility went out, and it stayed out, even as homes and businesses all around it saw their lights come back on.\n\nAs the indoor temperature climbed to the mid-80s Wednesday morning, humidity made the hard-surfaced floors slick with condensation. Patients gathered in a small day room to catch a slight breeze from screened windows. A handful of small fans powered by a borrowed generator were all that kept the situation from devolving into a medical emergency, said Dan Nelson, Cape Coral Shores’ chief operating officer.\n\n“People here are fragile,” Nelson said, adding that air-conditioning in such facilities is a medical necessity. “This is not just about comfort, it’s about safety. We have magnet door locks that don’t work, fire suppression equipment whose batteries have run out, assisted bed lifts that don’t work. And the temperatures today and tomorrow are headed back to the mid-90s.”\n\nA state emergency official said Wednesday afternoon he had found a large generator and 50 gallons of gas for the facility, but there was no need: The power came back on.\n\n[Most of Florida lost power in Hurricane Irma. Here’s what it looks like from space.]\n\nWhile the Sunshine State was the hardest hit by the outages, they extended to the other states Irma raked as it headed north. Hundreds of thousands lost power in the Carolinas, Alabama and Georgia, where at one point 800,000 were experiencing outages on Tuesday, though that number declined during the day.\n\nThe deteriorating storm once known as Hurricane Irma — classified Tuesday as a post-tropical cyclone — grazed onward through the Mississippi Valley, losing essentially all of its prior strength but still drenching some areas with rainfall.\n\nAcross the southeast, even as people acknowledged that they had dodged the worst possible hit from Irma, they were still left to contend with destroyed homes, flooded cities, swollen rivers, canceled flights and debris in the streets.\n\nThe city of Jacksonville, Fla., remained flooded after the St. Johns River overflowed so severely the day before that it forced residents from their homes. Charleston, S.C., city officials said the intense flooding there on Monday closed more than 111 roads, most of which had reopened Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities said they were investigating several fatalities that came since the storm made landfall, though it was not clear how many were directly due to the storm.\n\nAmong them were a 51-year-old man in Winter Park, Fla., outside Orlando, who police said was apparently electrocuted by a downed power line in a roadway. In Georgia, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office said a 67-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on her car; the mayor of Sandy Springs said a 55-year-old man was killed when a tree fell on the bedroom where he was sleeping.\n\nIn other cases, fatal car crashes claimed lives as the storm loomed. And other dangers also lurked: Officials warned of the risks posed by the generators people have used since the storm knocked out power. The Daytona Beach Fire Department said Wednesday morning that one person was dead and three others taken to a hospital for carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator inside a home, and the department urged people to keep their generators outside.\n\n[Why Irma wasn’t far worse]\n\nIn Key West, it remained unclear when power, cellphone service or supplies would be available again.\n\n“What you have on hand is rationed to make sure you can get through,” said Todd Palenchar, 48, noting that his supplies of food and water are designed to last for a week. “You don’t know how long it’s going to be.”\n\nPalenchar said he is used to camping and roughing it, but his main concern right now is his property.\n\n“I’ve already posted signs where I’m at, ‘Looters will be shot, no questions asked,’” he said as he pulled up his shirt to reveal a .380 caliber pistol.\n\nMonroe County said in a statement that no assessments had been done yet determining the percentage of damage or the cost in the Keys, with Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers saying in a statement: “Things look real damaged from the air, but when you clear the trees and all the debris, it’s not much damage to the houses.”\n\nAs Irma tore through the Caribbean and approached the Keys last week, authorities had ordered millions in Florida to evacuate and, in some cases, ordered them to hit the road again as the storm’s path wobbled. On Tuesday, officials slowly began letting those people return home.\n\nIn Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys, and other places that let residents back, officials warned that many areas are still without power, cellphone reception is questionable and most gas stations remain shut.\n\nMiami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said about half of the county’s traffic signals were out. Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief said the number was closer to 45 percent of traffic signals there. Across the state, the explanations for the outages were visible alongside the road.\n\n“It’s a lot of trees and power lines and snapped poles,” said Kate Albers, a spokeswoman for Collier County, which stretches across southwestern Florida and includes Marco Island, where Irma made her second landfall.\n\n“I can tell you from driving around you see lines down all over the place,” Albers said. “You see trees thrown through power lines and you’ll see an occasional pole.”\n\nThe high number of outages across Florida were due largely to the storm’s massive size, said Ted Kury, director of energy studies for the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida.\n\n“For a significant period of time, the entire state was under a hurricane warning,” Kury said. “Normally it comes through, sometimes it comes through fast and sometimes it comes through slowly. But this one hit pretty much everybody.”\n\nKury was among those who did not lose power but did lose Internet, cable and cellphone service, so he and his wife had to walk to the next development before his wife got enough signal to text their oldest son and her parents.\n\nStorms that rip down power lines are frequently followed by questions about why more power lines are not buried underground, away from punishing winds.\n\nCost is one factor. A 2012 report for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electrical utilities, found that it can be five to 10 times more expensive to put lines underground — otherwise known as “undergrounding” — than to hang them overhead.\n\nThe utilities also weigh issues such as how much cost they can pass on to their customers and the aesthetics of overhead wires, Kury said, noting that there is no uniform policy for power companies because diverse regions have different needs.\n\n“It’s kind of a misstatement when folks say undergrounding power lines protects them from damage,” Kury said. “What it really does is insulates them from damage from wind events and flying debris. But it makes them more susceptible to things like flooding and things like storm surge.”\n\nHe added: “If you’re in an area where your biggest risk to the infrastructure is storm surge and flooding, putting the lines underground can actually make them more susceptible to damage and not less.”\n\n[Richard Branson urges “Marshall Plan” for Caribbean after Irma]\n\nFlorida utility companies embarked upon a massive response effort to get the lights back on. Gould, the spokesman for FPL, said the company had dispatched 20,000 workers to work day and night restoring power, first to critical care infrastructure — like hospitals and 911 systems — and then to feeders that send juice to the most customers. Finally, they get to individual neighborhoods.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, where gas-powered generators had growled through the night, residents lit their way with battery-powered lanterns, flashlights and tea lights.\n\n“We’ve run out of power before,” said Jeanne Isacco, 71, reaching for her walker to stand and punctuate her point. “Why do you think we live here? Excuse me! We know it’s hot.”\n\nBerman and Zezima reported from Washington. Darryl Fears in St. Petersburg, Leonard Shapiro in Fort Lauderdale, Camille Pendley in Atlanta, Dustin Waters in Charleston, Kirk Ross in Raleigh, Scott Unger in Key West, Fla., and Brian Murphy, Angela Fritz and Carol Morello in Washington contributed to this report, which was updated throughout the day.\n\n1 of 71 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Aftermath: Residents assess damage in the wake of Hurricane Irma View Photos The full extent of the damage caused by Irma, which destroyed homes and cut off power for many, is being determined.

"Could Illinois be the first state to file for bankruptcy?\nIllinois residents may feel some solidarity with the likes of Puerto Rico and Detroit.\n\nA financial crunch is spiraling into a serious problem for Illinois lawmakers, prompting some observers to wonder if the state might make history by becoming the first to go bankrupt. At the moment, it's impossible for a state to file for bankruptcy protection, which is only afforded to counties and municipalities like Detroit.\n\nChapter 9 bankruptcy protection could be extended to states if Congress took up the issue, although Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell noted in an article last year that he believed the precedents are iffy for extending the option to states. Nevertheless, Illinois is in a serious financial pickle, which is why radical options such as bankruptcy are being floated as potential solutions.\n\nRatings agency Moody's Investor Service earlier this month downgraded Illinois' general obligation bonds to its lowest investment grade rating, citing the state's growing pile of unpaid bills and its mounting pension deficit. Illinois, by the way, has the lowest credit rating of any state. Lower ratings mean higher borrowing costs, since lenders view such borrowers as riskier bets.\n\n'Legislative gridlock has sidetracked efforts not only to address pension needs but also to achieve fiscal balance, allowing a backlog of bills to approach $15 billion, or about 40 percent of the state's operating budget,' the agency noted.\n\nAs noted by the Fiscal Times, Illinois is the only state that's been operating without a balanced and complete budget for almost two years.\n\n'We're like a banana republic. We can't manage our money,' Gov. Bruce Rauner said after the Illinois Legislature failed to produce a full 2017 budget earlier this month.\n\nThe situation has prompted comparisons with Puerto Rico, which earlier this year announced a historic restructuring of some of its $70 billion in debt through courts after negotiations with bondholders failed.\n\nLike Puerto Rico, Illinois has a massive pension crisis. Its unfunded pension liability for the state's five major plans grew 25 percent alone in one year, reaching $251 billion, according to Moody's. On a per-household basis, the state's pension debt burden stands at $27,000, according to the conservative-leaning Illinois Policy Institute.\n\nSo how did the state's pensions balloon into such a crisis? First, the pension problem has been a long time in the making. The state has more than 660 government pension funds, which are sometimes called defined benefit plans because they promise workers will receive a specific pension when they retire.\n\nBut critics say some of those pensions carried overly optimistic assumptions, especially given periods of market turmoil like the global financial crisis, which ate into investment returns. The state's general assembly wasn't required to fully fund pensions, which meant tax money was spent on other priorities such as schools or infrastructure.\n\nThe result? Growing unfunded liabilities, or money promised to workers in their pensions when they retire that the state doesn't have. Other contributing factors include inadequate employer contributions and benefit increases, according to the Civic Federation.\n\nAdding to the state's financial pain is a shrinking tax base. For the last three consecutive years, Illinois has lost residents. Its population is now at its lowest in a decade. Tepid wage growth on top of fewer residents puts a strain on the state's ability to grow its tax revenue.\n\nIt's not unprecedented for a state to default on its debt. Arkansas defaulted in 1933 as it struggled to repay debt during the the Great Depression. Spending on an ambitious road-building project and a series of natural disasters heightened the Southern state's problems.\n\nBankruptcy is often seen as a last-ditch effort, but it also can help struggling cities or companies reinvent themselves on a stronger financial footing. Detroit serves an example of how a reorganization can help, at least in the near-term. The city is now paying its bills and is keeping up with maintenance, although it still has a looming pension payment that could spell trouble in just a few years, according to the Detroit Free-Press.\n\nAs Michigan Treasurer Nick Khouri told the publication, 'We certainly know many people were hurt during the bankruptcy, but what would have been the alternative and how would they have been hurt under the alternative?'\n\nAs for Illinois, Rauner on Thursday called state legislators to a 10-day special session starting next week to hammer out a budget deal and end an unprecedented impasse that could soon enter a third year.\n\nThe Republican announced the news in a Facebook video and statement, accusing majority Democrats of 'ignoring' his recommendations.\n\n'We have tough, urgent choices to make, and the Legislature must be present to make them,' he said.\n\nLawmakers adjourned last month without a deal before a critical May 31 deadline, triggering the need for a three-fifths majority vote instead of a majority on a budget agreement. The new fiscal year begins July 1. Rauner has called for a special session running from June 21 to July 30.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-illinois-be-the-first-state-to-file-for-bankruptcy/","None"
"Malcolm Young, AC/DC guitarist and co-founder, dead at 64\nNEW YORK -- Malcolm Young, the rhythm guitarist and guiding force behind the bawdy hard rock band AC/DC who helped create such head-banging anthems as 'Highway to Hell,' ''Hells Bells' and 'Back in Black,' has died. He was 64.\n\n'With enormous dedication and commitment he was the driving force behind the band,' the band said on its website. 'As a guitarist, songwriter and visionary he was a perfectionist and a unique man. He always stuck to his guns and did and said exactly what he wanted.'\n\nYoung founded the Australian rock band with his brother Angus in 1973. He was the group's rhythm guitarist until 2014, when the band announced he was taking a leave of absence for health reasons. It was later revealed he had been diagnosed for dementia.\n\nThe family put out a statement posted on the band's website calling Young a 'visionary who inspired many.'\n\nToday it is with deep heartfelt sadness that AC/DC has to announce the passing of Malcolm Young. Malcolm, along with... Posted by AC/DC on Saturday, November 18, 2017\n\nWhile Young's younger brother, Angus, the group's school-uniform-wearing lead guitarist, was the public face of the band, Malcolm Young was its key writer and leader, the member the rest of the band watched for onstage changes and cutoffs.\n\nAC/DC were remarkably consistent for over 40 years with its mix of driving hard rock, lusty lyrics and bluesy shuffles, selling over 200 million albums, surviving the loss of its first singer and creating one of the greatest rock records ever in 'Back in Black,' the world's second best-selling album behind Michael Jackson's 'Thriller.'\n\nThe Glasgow-born Young brothers -- who moved to Sydney, Australia, with their parents, sister and five older brothers in 1963 -- formed the band in 1973. They were inspired to choose the high-energy name AC/DC from the back of a sewing machine owned by their sister, Margaret.\n\nAngus experimented with several different stage costumes at first -- including a gorilla suit and a Zorro outfit -- but the school uniform was a natural, since he was only 16 at the time.\n\nThe Youngs went through several drummers and bass guitarists, finally settling on Phil Rudd on drums in 1974 and Englishman Cliff Williams on bass three years later. Their original singer was fired after a few months when they discovered Bon Scott, who was originally hired as the band's driver.\n\nBy 1980, the band was on a roll, known for its high energy performances and predictably hard-charging songs. Their album 'Highway To Hell' was certified gold in America and made it into the top 25 Billboard album charts, and the single 'Touch Too Much' became their first UK Top 30 hit. But on Feb. 18, 1980, everything changed -- Scott died of asphyxiation after choking on his own vomit after an all-night drinking binge.\n\nThe band decided to keep going and hired English vocalist Brian Johnson at the helm. The newly reconfigured group channeled their grief into songwriting and put out 1980's 'Back In Black,' with the songs 'You Shook Me All Night Long,' ''Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution' and 'Hells Bells.' The cover of the album was black, in honor of Scott's death.\n\nThe band continued with a studio or live album every few years , blending their huge guitar riffs with rebellious and often sophomoric lyrics - song titles include 'Big Balls,' ''Beating Around the Bush,' ''Let Me Put My Love Into You' and 'Stiff Upper Lip.' AC/DC won only a single Grammy Award, for best hard rock performance in 2009 for 'War Machine.'\n\nRolling Stone said in 1980 that 'the AC/DC sound is nothing more and nothing less than aggressively catchy song hooks brutalized by a revved-up boogie rhythm, Malcolm's jackhammer riffing, Angus' guitar histrionics and Johnson's bloodcurdling bawl.'\n\nIn the book 'The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC' by Jesse Fink, Angus Young said the formula worked. 'We've got the basic thing kids want,' he said. 'They want to rock and that's it. They want to be part of the band as a mass. When you hit a guitar chord, a lot of the kids in the audience are hitting it with you. They're so much into the band they're going through all the motions with you. If you can get the mass to react as a whole, then that's the ideal thing. That's what a lot of bands lack, and why the critics are wrong.'\n\nAC/DC's infectious, driving sound stretched further than rock arenas. The song 'Shoot to Thrill' was heard in the film 'The Avengers,' ''Back in Black' made it into 'The Muppets,' ''Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap' was played in 'Bridesmaids' and their songs were included in the 'Iron Man' franchise. On TV, the band's music was heard in everything from 'Top Gear,' the 'Hawaii Five-0' reboot, 'Glee,' ''CSI: Miami' and 'The Voice.'\n\nThough the band championed good-natured hell-raising, it had to weather suggestions in the 1980s that they were a threat to the moral fabric of society. There were rumors the band's name stood for Anti-Christ/Devil's Children and many were shocked when it was learned that serial murderer and rapist Richard Ramirez identified himself as a fan and left an AC/DC baseball cap behind at a crime scene.\n\nIn 2014, the band released 'Rock or Bust,' the first AC/DC album without Malcolm Young. Even so, he is very present on the record since the 11 songs are credited to the Young brothers (Angus said he built the album from guitar hooks the two had accumulated over the years).\n\nAround the album's release, Angus Young said that Malcolm was doing fine, but that he couldn't perform anymore.\n\n'It was progressing further, but he knew he couldn't do it,' Angus Young said of his older brother's dementia. 'He had continued as long as he could, still writing. But he said to me, 'Keep it going.''\n\nThe fate of the band was also put into doubt by the retirement of Williams, legal trouble for Rudd and Johnson's hearing loss, which forced him to leave. The band enlisted Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose to sing on tour in 2016.\n\nSeveral musicians paid their respects to Malcolm Young on social media, writing about his influence and impact in music.\n\n'It is a sad day in rock and roll. Malcolm Young was my friend and the heart and soul of AC/DC. I had some of the best times of my life with him on our 1984 European tour,' Eddie Van Halen tweeted on Saturday. 'He will be missed and my deepest condolences to his family, bandmates and friends.'\n\n'The driving engine of AC/DC has died. A tragic end for a sometimes unsung icon. One of the true greats. RIP,' Paul Stanley, of Kiss, wrote on Twitter.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/malcolm-young-acdc-guitarist-and-co-founder-dead-at-64/","None"
"Police say Las Vegas gunman planned ‘extensively,’ used cameras to monitor officers as they approached\nInvestigators trying to determine what sparked the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history have found the massacre to be the work of a sophisticated planner with the means and desire to inflict unprecedented carnage.\n\nBut on the second full day after Stephen Paddock smashed out the windows of a high-floor suite on the Las Vegas Strip and opened fire on a crowd of unsuspecting concertgoers, authorities still were trying to understand what drove him to such evil.\n\nSeveral new details emerged Tuesday about Paddock — a 64-year-old retired accountant — and how he worked methodically to thwart law enforcement as he killed scores of people and injured hundreds more.\n\nAs he fired round after round during an 11-minute stretch from a suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Paddock used video cameras to keep an eye out for police storming his hotel room, according to Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\n\nPaddock hid one camera in the peephole of his suite and two more in the hall, at least one of them disguised on a service cart, authorities said. At one point, he shot numerous rounds through the door, wounding a security guard. Paddock eventually put a gun in his own mouth and pulled the trigger as SWAT officers closed in. They found him with blood pooling behind his head and around the empty shell casings that littered the carpet, a handgun near his body.\n\n“It was preplanned, extensively, and I’m pretty sure that he evaluated everything that he did in his actions, which is troublesome,” Lombardo said.\n\nThe sheriff said investigators were “making progress” on determining a motive, but complete answers remained elusive. There were precious few clues in Paddock’s background.\n\nNeighbors in several states where Paddock owned homes in retirement communities describe him as surly, unfriendly and standoffish. Paddock was the son of a bank robber who was once on the FBI’s most-wanted list and who authorities described at the time as a “psychopath,” but Paddock’s brother said their father was not involved in their lives when they were children.\n\nRelatives say the roots of Paddock’s loner lifestyle might have been planted on July 28, 1960. On that day, when Paddock was 7, a neighbor from across the street took him swimming. The neighbor told a local newspaper at the time that she knew authorities were coming for his father, and she wanted to spare the young boy from the trauma of seeing his father taken away. From that point on, Paddock’s family was never the same.\n\nUntil carrying out the massacre Sunday night, Paddock had no criminal history himself. Despite repeated claims by the Islamic State to the contrary, he also had no ties to international terror groups, authorities said. He had done some government work during his career, as a letter carrier for the Postal Service, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service and an auditor for the federal government’s Defense Contract Audit Agency in the late 1970s and 1980s. He was divorced twice and recently had been dating a woman from the Philippines who has Australian citizenship. He was known to gamble routinely and extensively.\n\nSome public officials seemed to suggest Paddock’s mind was troubled, though there were no immediate indications that he had been diagnosed with a mental illness or was anything other than fully aware of what he was doing.\n\n“A normal person would not cause this type of harm to innocent people,” said Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.). “Clearly, there was something wrong with this man.”\n\nPeople close to the investigation also said that in the weeks before the attack, Paddock transferred a large amount of money — close to $100,000 — to someone in the Philippines, possibly his girlfriend. The significance of that development was not immediately clear, though investigators said they were interested in probing Paddock’s finances and his avid interest in high-stakes gambling.\n\nThe girlfriend, Marilou Danley, returned to the United States from the Philippines Tuesday night and was met at Los Angeles International Airport by FBI agents, according to wire reports. Investigators considered her a “person of interest,” Lombardo said. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said that police are eager to talk to her, as Paddock “doesn’t meet any profiles” and the “best lead is through this girlfriend.”\n\n“They don’t know a lot about who the girlfriend is and why she left the country a week prior to the shooting,” said Heller, who has been briefed by authorities. “She is someone they need to have this discussion with to better understand the shooting and what his thought process was.”\n\nAt his home in Orlando, Eric Paddock, Stephen Paddock’s brother, said he doubts Danley had any prior knowledge of the incident and speculated that Stephen might have been trying to quietly ensure her financial stability. Stephen Paddock loved and doted on his girlfriend, whom he had met when she was a hostess at a casino, Eric Paddock said. The couple often gambled side by side.\n\n“He manipulated her to be as far away from here and safe when he committed this,” Eric Paddock said. “The people he loved he took care of, and as he was descending into hell he took care of her.”\n\nThe shooting — which left 59 people dead and injured more than 500 others — reignited the debate on Capitol Hill and across the country about whether lawmakers should impose new restrictions on firearms. Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg on Tuesday evening clarified that Paddock was among the 59 slain in the incident; previously, authorities had said he wasn’t.\n\nUndersheriff Kevin C. McMahill, speaking after Fudenberg, warned that the number of dead and injured could fluctuate as the investigation progresses.\n\n“The answer that the coroner provided you is the most recent, relevant number that we have,” McMahill said.\n\nSeveral Democrats used the massacre to push for new restrictions, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) asserted Tuesday that Republican leaders have no plans to advance a bill, which passed a House committee last month, that would make it easier to buy gun silencers.\n\nLeaving the White House to visit hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday morning, President Trump said that “we’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.”\n\nPaddock brought 23 guns to his Mandalay Bay suite, which overlooked the concert grounds on the southern end of the Strip. Included in that cache was an AR-15-type rifle with a high-capacity magazine and 12 “bump stocks,” a modification that would allow a gun to fire as if it were an automatic weapon. He also brought another AR-15-type rifle with a magnification scope commonly used for hunting and a bipod stand to help steady it, according to law enforcement officials and experts who reviewed images of the weapons posted online.\n\n“For this individual to take it upon himself to create this chaos and harm is unspeakable,” Lombardo said.\n\nThe guns appeared to be but a piece of the arsenal Paddock had acquired during a period of years, at least some of it legally obtained from major retailers such as Cabela’s, national retailer of guns and outdoor gear, and Guns & Guitars, a store in Mesquite, Nev., according to people familiar with the case. ATF Special Agent in Charge Jill A. Snyder said Tuesday Paddock had purchased shotguns, handguns and rifles in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas.\n\nAt Paddock’s home in Mesquite, Nev., investigators recovered 19 more guns and an explosive, and in his car, they found ammonium nitrate, a chemical that can be used in bomb making. At another property in Reno, Nev., investigators recovered five more handguns, two shotguns and a “plethora” of ammunition, Lombardo said Tuesday.\n\nPaddock probably secreted the weapons to his Mandalay Bay suite using more than 10 suitcases he brought with him. Lombardo said hotel housekeeping had been there since Paddock checked in on Sept. 28 and spotted nothing nefarious.\n\nLombardo said investigators had scoured Paddock’s suite, his car and the homes in Nevada, and they were examining surveillance and body camera video evidence and other electronic items they had seized in their searches. Separately, Lombardo said the department had opened an investigation into the unauthorized release of images that show the crime scene. Another sheriff’s official confirmed the authenticity of those images.\n\nPolice also continued documenting the crime scene and performing the grim task of identifying those slain, some of whom died blocks away from the concert as they tried to flee or seek help. As of late Tuesday afternoon, authorities had tentatively identified all of the victims.\n\nSince the shooting, horrific stories have emerged of lives cut short, some taking bullets as they sought to protect their loved ones.\n\nBobby and Jenny Parks, a married couple from California who had been high school sweethearts, were swaying to a love song when a bullet struck her. He held her as she died.\n\nAfter Cameron Robinson, a 27-year-old from Utah, was shot in the neck, his boyfriend, Robert Eardley, carried him to a vehicle. Robinson died before they made it to a hospital.\n\nTwo people who met at the festival — Kody Robertson and Michelle Vo — were watching the final act together when a bullet struck her chest. Robertson threw his body over hers to protect her. Later, they were separated; he tracked her down to a hospital and was told late Monday morning that she was dead.\n\nPaddock’s weaponry would have allowed him to fire both rapidly and precisely at the crowd that was several hundred yards away and below him. The shots — fired from two windows of Mandalay Bay’s golden facade, which Paddock had smashed out — sent thousands of people scrambling for safety under Vegas’s neon glow. Police on Tuesday showed body camera footage of officers scrambling to determine where the shots came from as they yelled for people to leave the area.\n\n“They’re shooting right at us, guys,” an officer can be heard saying. “Stay down! Stay down!”\n\nHospitals across the region continued to treat patients from the scene, many of them seriously injured. Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center says as of Tuesday night, 59 patients remain in the hospital and 31 of them are still in critical condition. University Medical Center said it had 64 patients from the attack, 12 of them critical.\n\nLynh Bui and Tim Craig in Las Vegas; Barbara Liston in Orlando; Ally Gravina in Reno, Nev.; William Dauber in Los Angeles; and Alex Horton, Wesley Lowery, Julie Tate, Jessica Contrera, Sandhya Somashekar, Aaron C.

"Iceberg twice size of Luxembourg breaks off Antarctic ice shelf\nA giant iceberg twice the size of Luxembourg has broken off an ice shelf on the Antarctic peninsula and is now adrift in the Weddell Sea.\n\nReported to be “hanging by a thread” last month, the trillion-tonne iceberg was found to have split off from the Larsen C segment of the Larsen ice shelf on Wednesday morning after scientists examined the latest satellite data from the area.\n\nThe Larsen C ice shelf is more than 12% smaller in area than before the iceberg broke off – or “calved” – an event that researchers say has changed the landscape of the Antarctic peninsula and left the Larsen C ice shelf at its lowest extent ever recorded.\n\n\n\n“It is a really major event in terms of the size of the ice tablet that we’ve got now drifting away,” said Anna Hogg, an expert in satellite observations of glaciers from the University of Leeds.\n\n\n\nAt 5,800 sq km the new iceberg, expected to be dubbed A68, is half as big as the record-holding iceberg B-15 which split off from the Ross ice shelf in the year 2000, but it is nonetheless believed to be among the 10 largest icebergs ever recorded.\n\nThe huge crack that spawned the new iceberg grew over a period of years, but between 25 May and 31 May alone, the rift grew by 17km – the largest increase since January. Between the 24 June and 27 June the movement of the ice sped up, reaching a rate of more than 10 metres per day for the already-severed section.\n\n\n\nBut in the end it wasn’t a simple break – data collected just days before the iceberg calved revealed that the rift had branched multiple times. “We see one large [iceberg] for now. It is likely that this will break into smaller pieces as time goes by,” said Adrian Luckman, professor of glaciology at Swansea University and leader of the UK’s Midas project which is focused on the state of the ice shelf.\n\n\n\nAdrian Luckman (@adrian_luckman) The Larsen-C rift opening over the last 2 years from #Sentinel1 pic.twitter.com/MT9d3HAw1M\n\nUnlike thin layers of sea ice, ice shelves are floating masses of ice, hundreds of metres thick, which are attached to huge, grounded ice sheets. These ice shelves act like buttresses, holding back and slowing down the movement into the sea of the glaciers that feed them.\n\n“There is enough ice in Antarctica that if it all melted, or even just flowed into the ocean, sea levels [would] rise by 60 metres,” said Martin Siegert, professor of geosciences at Imperial College London and co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change & Environment.\n\n\n\nBut while the birth of the huge iceberg might look dramatic, experts say it will not itself result in sea level rises. “It’s like your ice cube in your gin and tonic – it is already floating and if it melts it doesn’t change the volume of water in the glass by very much at all,” said Hogg.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the more northerly Larsen A ice shelf in 1995 and Larsen B in 2002, all eyes have turned to Larsen C.\n\n\n\nBut Siegert is quick to point out that the calving of the new iceberg is not a sign that the ice shelf is about to disintegrate, stressing that ice shelves naturally break up as they extend further out into the ocean. “I am not unduly concerned about it – it is not the first mega iceberg ever to have formed,” he said.\n\n\n\nAndrew Shepherd, professor of Earth Observation at the University of Leeds, agreed. “Everyone loves a good iceberg, and this one is a corker,” he said. “But despite keeping us waiting for so long, I’m pretty sure that Antarctica won’t be shedding a tear when it’s gone because the continent loses plenty of its ice this way each year, and so it’s really just business as usual!”\n\n\n\nLuckman said that while the Larsen C ice shelf might continue to shed icebergs, it might regrow. Nevertheless previous research by the team has suggested that the remaining ice shelf is likely less stable now that the iceberg has calved, although it is unlikely the event would have any short-term effects. “We will have to wait years or decades to know what will happen to the remainder of Larsen C,” he said, pointing out that it took seven years after the release of a large iceberg from Larsen B before the ice shelf became unstable and disintegrated.\n\n\n\nQ&A How significant is the release of the Larsen C megaberg? Show Hide In terms of size, it’s fairly big. This is a 5,800 sq km iceberg - that’s twice the size of Luxembourg, or roughly the area of Delaware. While that doesn’t make it the largest iceberg on record - that gong goes to an iceberg that broke away from the Ross ice shelf in 2000 - it is one of the biggest. It is also exciting for the technological advances that have allowed scientists to regularly track the development of the rift, monitoring its growth down to 1km resolution. But in terms of its impact, the event is less dramatic: the iceberg itself won’t result in a sea level rise, and scientists say there is no evidence its formation is down to climate change. But, they note, the release of the iceberg might make the rest of the Larsen C ice shelf less stable. Collapse of the Larsen C ice shelf would remove buttressing from glaciers, meaning they could flow faster into the sea, eventually resulting in sea level rises. Only time will tell what the full impact of the birth of the new iceberg will be.\n\nWhat’s more, Luckman stressed that while large melt ponds were seen on Larsen B prior to its collapse - features which are thought to have affected the structure of the ice shelf - those seen on Larsen C are far smaller and are not even present at this time of year.\n\n\n\nAnd while climate change is accepted to have played a role in the wholesale disintegration of the Larsen A and Larsen B ice shelves, Luckman emphasised that there is no evidence that the calving of the giant iceberg is linked to such processes.\n\nTwila Moon, a glacier expert at the US National Ice and Snow Data Center agrees but, she said, climate change could have made the situation more likely.\n\n“Certainly the changes that we see on ice shelves, such as thinning because of warmer ocean waters, are the sort [of changes] that are going to make it easier for these events to happen,” she said.\n\nLuckman is not convinced. “It is a possibility, but recent data from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography actually show most of the shelf thickening,” he said.\n\nThe progress of the rift, and the loss of the iceberg, has been carefully followed by analysis of radar images from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 mission, which provides data from the region every six days.\n\n“Before we would have been lucky if we had got one satellite image a year of an event like this, so we would not have been able to watch it unfold,” said Hogg, pointing out that the radar system allows data to be collected whatever the weather and in the dark, while technological advances mean more data that can be downloaded than for previous satellites.\n\nThe news of the giant iceberg comes after US president Donald Trump announced that the US will be withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate accord – an agreement signed by more than 190 countries to tackle global warming. “Truly I am dismayed,” said Moon of the move.\n\nNow at the mercy of the ocean currents, the newly calved iceberg could last for decades, depending on whether it enters warmer waters or bumps into other icebergs or ice shelves.\n\n\n\n","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/12/giant-antarctic-iceberg-breaks-free-of-larsen-c-ice-shelf","1499832000.0"

'He reached his right hand around to my behind, and as we smiled for the photo he asked the group, 'Do you want to know who my favorite magician is?' As I felt his hand dig into my flesh, he said, 'David Cop-a-Feel!' '\n\nBush's spokesman Jim McGrath responded to the allegations with a statement — a 'non-apology apology' — to multiple news organizations:\n\n'At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner.

"Trump Meets Palestinian Leader Abbas and Wants Mideast Peace Deal\nThis possible endorsement of a one-nation solution to the conflict would be very difficult for both sides. It would either end up being two systems for two peoples, which Palestinians would see as apartheid and unending occupation — or equal rights for all, which would compromise Israel’s Jewish character.\n\nTrump has said he is looking 'very, very strongly' at moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the disputed holy city that both Palestinians and Israelis lay claim to.\n\nSo for Palestinians, it will be vital that Abbas simply presents an alternate view of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n\n“For us the most important thing in this meeting is that it will allow a Palestinian perspective,” Khatib said. “The current American president is very familiar with the Israeli side and is constantly in touch with the Israeli point of view, but is a stranger to the Palestinian narrative.”\n\nA Palestinian demonstrator throws an old shoe at a poster of President Donald Trump during a protest in the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron on Feb. 24. Hazem Bader / AFP/Getty Images\n\nYossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at London's Chatham House think tank, said it is possible that Trump's well-known unpredictability could be a positive for the Palestinians.\n\n“He’s not interested in details,” he said. “Israelis and Palestinians know all the details. What Trump can contribute is that he is ready to act regardless of not knowing the details, which might do something ... in the unpredictable world we live in right now.”\n\nTrump's close relationship with Netanyahu will not be the only thing the Palestinian Authority leader is up against. Abbas, 82, also faces challenges at home. Palestinians — who are partly governed by militant group Hamas which has ruled the seaside enclave of Gaza since it won an election there in 2006 — are more despondent and divided than ever.\n\nPalestinians travel past destroyed buildings on their way to their homes in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza Strip, in August 2014. Oliver Weiken / EPA file\n\nThere is widespread disappointment at the lack of a political solution to the Israeli occupation and general malaise brought on by a slowing economy and high unemployment.\n\nThe release on Monday of a Hamas political document declaring their recognition of Israel’s 1967 borders — while explicitly not recognizing the 'legitimacy of the Zionist entity' — draws attention away from Abbas' more secular government and undermines the message that he speaks for the Palestinian people as a whole.\n\nIsrael has fought three wars with Hamas, which does not recognize its legitimacy as an independent Jewish state. Militant rockets are often fired at Israeli territory. The group rules the desperately poor population of approximately 1.9 million people — 1.3 million of whom are refugees displaced during the establishment of the state of Israel — with an iron fist.\n\nAbbas’ Palestinian Authority is also at odds with Hamas in Gaza, which has been blockaded by the Israelis for years.

"How Xi Jinping became one of modern China's most powerful leaders\n(CNN) After less than five years as China's leader, Xi Jinping has become one of the most powerful people in the nation's modern history, outshining his immediate predecessors.\n\n'He is a powerful figure, he is the most powerful leader since (paramount leader) Deng Xiaoping, but again his power has limitations,' Cheng Li, director at the Brookings Institution's John L. Thornton China Center, told CNN. 'China is not in the mood for a dictator-like figure.'\n\nA relative enigma when he came into power, in this first term Xi has revealed himself as not only an economic and political conservative but also a skilled populist.\n\nNow, after being declared the country's 'core leader' in late 2016, Xi may be preparing to break two decades of tradition and stay on after his second term as head of the ruling Communist Party ends in 2022, some analysts say.\n\nStill, as China steps up to the global stage in the wake of US President Donald Trump's election, experts are divided on whether Xi can steer his country through the difficult times ahead.\n\nSon of a revolutionary\n\nXi was born in June 1953, just four years after the People's Republic of China was established by Chairman Mao Zedong.\n\nHe is one of China's 'princelings,' the sons and daughters of former revolutionary leaders who have risen into high positions within the party.\n\nHis father was Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary fighter and former Chinese vice premier, who also pioneered China's early experiments with capitalism, helping to establish Shenzhen's Special Economic Zone.\n\nAs with many Chinese leaders, little is known about Xi's early years until his father and family fell out of favor during the chaotic upheaval of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nXi (R) meets with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) in Beijing on March 19.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1975, Xi worked as an agricultural laborer in Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, one of 30 million urban youths who were sent to the countryside to teach them a lesson.\n\nXi's time in Liangjiahe has become a powerful part of his personal narrative. Chinese tourists can even go to the city and see a small museum built to commemorate his time working among the people.\n\nEventually Xi's father was rehabilitated after Mao's death, and his son officially joined first the Communist Party in 1974, then became an official in the Chinese government.\n\nJUST WATCHED On China: Is Xi Jinping more Mao, or Putin? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH On China: Is Xi Jinping more Mao, or Putin? 01:32\n\nRise to power\n\nXi's first official job in the Chinese government was personal secretary to the then-Minister of Defense Geng Biao.\n\nA trip as part of a Chinese delegation to inspect US farming technology in Iowa in 1985 left a strong impression on the young leader, and he would return to the area as China's vice president about 27 years later.\n\nIowa governor Terry Branstad, who met Xi on his 1985 trip, was named as Trump's pick for ambassador to China in December.\n\nThe young princeling rose quickly through the ranks, and in 2002 he was named the party secretary of Zhejiang province, on China's eastern coast.\n\nWilly Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Center for China Studies, said Xi turned his five years in Zhejiang province into a major advantage, building a power base that sustains him to this day.\n\n'He has promoted large numbers of his former colleagues, associates, from Zhejiang province ... this so-called Zhejiang faction is a major component of the Xi Jinping faction,' Lam said.\n\n'The Xi Jinping faction, this is a testimony to his success in self-aggrandizement. It is now the largest faction in the party.'\n\nThen-Vice President Xi (2nd R) climbs out of the cab of a tractor with Rick Kimberley (R) while touring his family farm on February 16, 2012 in Maxwell, Iowa.\n\nIn 2007, Xi was anointed as a member of China's nine-member Politburo Standing Committee, the country's top decision-making body.\n\nJust five years later, he was named the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in November 2012, and officially became China's president four months later in March.\n\nBut Xi's style as party leader would be very different from that of his immediate predecessors, former leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who followed collective decision making in the Deng model.\n\n'Deng was a major victim of the Cultural Revolution, so the first thing he said after taking power was no more personality cults, no more hero worship,' Lam said.

In many ways (corruption) was the greatest challenge for the communist system since the end of the Cultural Revolution,' Li said.\n\nBut some have pointed out that the campaign's high-ranking targets were rarely Xi's supporters.\n\n'This anti-corruption campaign is very selective,' Chinese leadership analyst Bo Zhiyue told CNN. 'Some people say if you look at the names of people who have been brought down, you don't see a lot of names of (Xi's) princeling allies.'\n\nAmid the anti-corruption campaign, a separate propaganda campaign praising and promoting Xi went into overdrive.\n\nChina's televisions and internet were filled with poetry lauding the Chinese leader , viral videos about his policies and visits by Xi to media organizations countrywide.\n\nAccording to a study by the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, in the first 18 months of Xi's administration, he was mentioned in party mouthpiece People's Daily twice as much as Hu had been\n\nwas made official when he was named the Communist Party's 'core,' In October 2016, Xi's special statuswas made official when he was named the Communist Party's 'core,' a powerfully symbolic title.

Even if 'he wants to be like Putin in Russia, to stay beyond his second term, we don't know if this can be realized.'\n\nLi said Xi needed to accumulate power in order to push through difficult political and economic reforms, but despite his bold power plays, China's president has left many economists frustrated.\n\nSome feel he has failed to live up to his rhetoric, particularly after his initial statements in 2012 that changes 'can brook no delay.'\n\n'His economic reforms have been disappointing ... He's a preservationist. He wants the (Communist Party) to maintain a total dominance over the country's political and, to some extent, economic resources,' Lam said.\n\n'He is not a man of the 21st century, he seems to be a throwback to the Mao Zedong era.'\n\n'In spite of his charisma, in spite of his Machiavellian skills in winning over enemies, he has these big problems that I think no one can solve,' Lam said.\n\n'How to square the circle?

For Jews, Jerusalem is home to the religion’s holiest site and is tied to its history as the location of the First and Second Temples.

Then, Palestinians took to the streets protesting Israel’s decision to install metal detectors at the entrance to the third holiest site in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nBut analysts say those were largely led by the public. The calls for protests this time came from the Palestinian leadership.\n\n“For a lot of Palestinians, the finer points of U.S. policymaking are not as relevant as the daily impact of the occupation,' said Hugh Lovatt, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in the Middle East and North Africa program.\n\nWhile recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, Trump signed a waiver pushing off the move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem for at least six months, just as every other U.S. president has done since Congress passed the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act.

"How Pirates Of The Caribbean Hijacked America's Metric System\nHow Pirates Of The Caribbean Hijacked America's Metric System\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NIST Museum NIST Museum\n\nIf the United States were more like the rest of the world, a McDonald's Quarter Pounder might be known as the McDonald's 113-Grammer, John Henry's 9-pound hammer would be 4.08 kilograms, and any 800-pound gorillas in the room would likely weigh 362 kilos.\n\nOne reason this country never adopted the metric system might be pirates. Here's what happened:\n\nIn 1793, the brand new United States of America needed a standard measuring system because the states were using a hodgepodge of systems.\n\n'For example, in New York, they were using Dutch systems, and in New England, they were using English systems,' says Keith Martin, of the research library at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nThis made interstate commerce difficult.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Keith Martin (Fed)/NIST Museum Keith Martin (Fed)/NIST Museum\n\nThe secretary of state at the time was Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson knew about a new French system and thought it was just what America needed. He wrote to his pals in France, and the French sent a scientist named Joseph Dombey off to Jefferson carrying a small copper cylinder with a little handle on top. It was about 3 inches tall and about the same wide.\n\nThis object was intended to be a standard for weighing things, part of a weights and measure system being developed in France, now known as the metric system. The object's weight was 1 kilogram.\n\nCrossing the Atlantic, Dombey ran into a giant storm.\n\n'It blew his ship quite far south into the Caribbean Sea,' says Martin.\n\nAnd you know who was lurking in Caribbean waters in the late 1700s? Pirates.\n\n'These pirates were British privateers, to be exact,' says Martin. 'They were basically water-borne criminals tacitly supported by the British government, and they were tasked with harassing enemy shipping.'\n\nThe pirates took Joseph Dombey prisoner on the island of Montserrat, hoping to obtain a ransom for him. Unfortunately for the pirates, and for Dombey as well, he died in captivity.\n\nThe pirates weren't interested in the objects Dombey was carrying. They were auctioned off along with the rest of the contents of his ship.\n\nUltimately, the kilogram made it into the hands of an American land surveyor at the time named Andrew Ellicott. It was passed down in the Ellicott family until 1952, when Andrew Ellicott Douglas, an astronomer, gave it to the agency that was the precursor of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the kilogram has been redefined over the years, so the version Dombey was carrying probably isn't exactly the same mass as the modern kilogram, which is a platinum-iridium artifact stored in France. Even that object will likely become obsolete next year when the kilogram is expected to be redefined again — not as a physical artifact but instead as something related to a fundamental constant in nature.\n\nWould it really have made any difference if Dombey had been able to deliver his kilogram to Jefferson?\n\n'We don't know for sure, but it seems like there was a missed opportunity there,' says Martin.\n\nThis wasn't the only occasion the United States could have gone metric. According to Toward a Metric America, a document on the NIST website, in 1866, 'Congress authorized the use of the metric system in this country and supplied each state with a set of standard metric weights and measures.'\n\nIn 1875, the United States signed the Convention du Mètre, establishing an international body to maintain metric standards. In 1893, all weights and measures used in this country were defined with respect to metric standards. So, 1 pound is officially defined as 0.45359237 kilograms, and 1 yard is 0.9144 meters.\n\nThe Metric Conversion Act of 1975 declared that it was the policy of the United States 'to designate the metric system of measurement as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.'\n\nThis act was later amended by the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Savings in Construction Act of 1996 and the Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004, all aimed at pushing the routine use of the metric system — so far, without much success.\n\nSo for now, we're stuck with Quarter Pounders and 9-pound hammers.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/28/574044232/how-pirates-of-the-caribbean-hijacked-americas-metric-system","1514437200.0"

"Scientists Sneak A Peek At How Ladybugs Fold Their Wings\nScientists Sneak A Peek At How Ladybugs Fold Their Wings\n\nWith the help of high-speed cameras, CT scanners and some nail-art supplies, scientists in Japan have managed to catch a glimpse of the elaborate way that ladybugs fold their wings to tuck them away.\n\nThe research could have implications for everything from aeronautics to umbrellas.\n\nThe study, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, explored how ladybugs can have wings strong enough to fly with, but quickly collapsible so they can be tucked out of the way.\n\nThe wings, after all, are much larger than the black-spotted wing cases they fold down to fit inside — as is immediately obvious easy to see if you just watch a video of the wings unfolding.\n\nBut the researchers at the University of Tokyo explain that no one knew how the ladybugs put the wings away, since they actually shut the wing cases first — then pull the wings inside. The interesting action is tucked out of sight.\n\nSo they replaced those distinctive red and black cases with transparent ones — built out of a kind of UV-cured resin that's often used in nail art, according to a press release from the university. The artificial wing case, called an elytron, allowed the researchers to watch how the wing folded.\n\n'I wasn't sure if the ladybug could fold its wings with an artificial elytron made of nail-art resin,' says Kazuya Saito, a professor at the University of Tokyo and the lead author on the study. 'So I was surprised when I found out it could.'\n\nThe scientists used high-speed cameras to record the process, and CT scans of folded and unfolded wings to help figure out the precise pattern of folds.\n\nThe process by which the wings collapse is akin to origami — in fact, the scientists used origami paper to recreate portions of the wing folds.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption University of Tokyo/PNAS University of Tokyo/PNAS\n\nAnd the wings remain stable when expanded partly because of veins that use 'tape springs' — the kind of curve that allows carpenter tape to hold itself straight.\n\n'The ladybugs' technique for achieving complex folding is quite fascinating and novel, particularly for researchers in the fields of robotics, mechanics, aerospace and mechanical engineering,' Saito said, according to the university's press release.\n\nIn the study, the scientists suggest some immediate applications for the research — including aircraft wings, space technology like folding antennas and solar arrays, and far more prosaic items like umbrellas and fans.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/20/529148056/scientists-sneak-a-peek-at-how-ladybugs-fold-their-wings","1495252800.0"

('Ultra violet' with a space, we'll note: actual 'ultraviolet' light is, by definition, invisible.)\n\nEach color of the year encompasses something about fashion, decorating and design trends while also reflecting 'what's needed in our world today,' the Pantone Color Institute's vice president, Laurie Pressman asserted in a statement.\n\nLat year's color of the year was a 'life-affirming' shade of green. The year before was a pairing of rose quartz and serene blue that was seen as anti-stress while also nodding toward gender fluidity, Pantone said.\n\nSo. What does purple have to say about our planet in 2018?\n\nIt's 'a dramatically provocative and thoughtful purple shade,' Pantone says, one that 'communicates originality, ingenuity, and visionary thinking that points us towards the future.'\n\nThink Prince, or David Bowie, or Jimi Hendrix, Pantone says. Think purple-toned pictures of stars scattered across the galaxy, the 'vast and limitless night sky,' the 'mysteries of the cosmos,' purple-lit meditation spaces.\n\nAnd — unmentioned by Pantone — in Alice Walker's novel The Color Purple, the color purple is presented as an example of God-given beauty.\n\nOf course, there are more worldly associations with the color as well.\n\nFor centuries, purple has been associated with royalty, because of the extraordinary expense of dying fabric purple.\n\nIn our current political climate, where red is linked with Republicans and blue with Democrats, purple is periodically identified as a symbol of bipartisanship — or, in the case of swing states, as a signifier of uncertain affiliation.\n\nAnd then there's Southern California.\n\n'The forecast for [Thursday] is purple,' Ken Pimlott said last night.\n\nPimlott, the director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, wasn't making an extremely accurate prediction about the Pantone color of the year .

Thames Water says the team is progressing at a rate of 20-30-tons a day.\n\nRimmer compared removing it to breaking up concrete.\n\nFor context, the BBC helpfully notes that the fatberg weighs almost as much as a blue whale.

Add Interest\n\nDozens of Tomahawk missiles struck the air base near Homs, damaging runways, towers and traffic control buildings, a local resident and human rights activist living near the air base told ABC News via an interpreter.\n\nU.S. officials believe the plane that dropped chemical weapons on civilians in Idlib Province on Tuesday, which according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights killed 86 people, took off from the same air base.\n\nThe attack lasted approximately 35 minutes and its impact was felt across the city, shaking houses and sending those inside them fleeing from their windows. Firefighters responded shortly after the attack was over.\n\nBy Friday, shops were closed, traffic was flowing normally, and regime forces were back in the air base to assess the damage. A Syrian Army spokesman announced on State TV that six people were killed and several more were injured in the attack. Both of the air base's major runways were struck by missiles, and some of its 40 fortified bunkers and some out-of-service planes, parked in a hangar, were damaged as well.\n\nLocal residents say the Russian military had used the air base in early 2016 but have since withdrawn their officers, so the base is now mainly operated by Syrian and Iranian military officers. There is also a hotel nearby where Iranian officers have been staying, though it was not clear whether it was damaged.\n\nThe city remains on high alert, and there is already a wave of people flowing out of the area surrounding the air base, possibly fearing a followup strike.\n\nThe airstrike follows confirmation by the Turkish Health Ministry that autopsies on several victims of Tuesday's attack confirmed the use of the nerve agent sarin in violation of international law and represents an escalation of U.S. involvement in the six-year conflict.\n\nSoon after the strike, President Donald Trump delivered a statement from his Mar-A-Lago retreat, where he was meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping.\n\n'There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored the urging of the UN security council,' Trump said Thursday night. 'Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behavior have all failed and failed very dramatically.'\n\nFormer National Security Adviser and ABC News contributor Richard Clarke said this attack, one of the quickest displays of force by a new president in recent history, is largely 'symbolic.'\n\nFollowing a 2013 chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1400 people outside of Damascus, which a U.S. government intelligence assessment concluded likely used a nerve agent, the Obama administration threatened retaliation but ultimately called off planned airstrikes after Assad agreed to turn over the majority of his chemical weapons arsenal to an international watchdog group.\n\nTrump, who was critical of Obama's decision during his presidential campaign, despite the fact that he in 2013 he urged Obama via Twitter not to take military action, has recently attempted to blame Obama's 'weakness' for the worsening violence in Syria.\n\n'This attack on one air base seems more symbolic,' Clarke said. 'I think Secretary of Defense [General] James Mattis gave the president a list of options, this being the smallest. It was a targeted attack not designed to overwhelm the Syrian military ...

The attitude shifted somewhat with the 2006 World Cup, where the German hosts unabashedly flew their flag and celebrated national pride.\n\nBut there is still enough of a void that leaves people with an “inner emptiness,” Ms. Reuter said. This gap in self-definition has left them no way to express their identity except by what they are not — what is sometimes termed a “negative identity.”\n\n“You can say ‘I’m not a Muslim,’ but most people can’t say ‘I am a Christian,’” or otherwise articulate a positive identity, she explained. “There is an emptiness. And I think that’s a societywide thing. It’s not just one group. It’s a very wide problem.”\n\nTaking Control\n\nGermany’s identity taboo is not new. But recent events may have made it suddenly feel more painful.\n\nImmo Fritsche, a political scientist at the University of Leipzig, has found that when people feel they have lost control, they seek a strong identity that will make them feel part of a powerful group.\n\nIdentifying with something powerful and capable of bringing about change, like a strong nation, becomes very attractive, he said.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/world/europe/how-a-sleepy-german-suburb-explains-europes-rising-far-right-movements.html","1489982400.0"
"Tillerson on North Korea: Russia and China must take 'direct action' over missile launch\nJapanese PM says Pyongyang has ‘no bright future’ and calls for UN security council meeting after projectile flew over island of Hokkaido\n\nJapan has warned North Korea it has “no bright future” and called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council after Pyongyang launched a ballistic missile over Japanese territory for the second time in just over a fortnight.\n\nThe missile, thought to be intermediate-range, flew further than any missile tested by the regime, triggering emergency sirens and text alerts minutes before it passed over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on Friday morning.\n\nHow has North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme progressed this year? Read more\n\nThe US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called for the international community to take “new measures” against North Korea, singling out Russia and China as the countries best placed to apply pressure on the regime, almost week after it tested what is now believed to be a powerful hydrogen bomb.\n\nAs major suppliers of oil to the regime, Russia and China “must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own,” Tillerson said in a statement.\n\nThe launch was an apparent show of defiance days after the UN security council approved a new round of sanctions against the regime. Flight data shows the missile travelled higher and further than the one involved in the 29 August flyover of Japan, suggesting the regime is continuing to make advances in its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.\n\nThe UN security council is due to meet in New York at 3pm local time on Friday to discuss the launch.\n\nShinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, called the launch “absolutely unacceptable”. He said the recent UN resolution banning North Korean textile exports and capping the supply of oil to the country “showed the international community’s unified strong will for a peaceful solution. But despite that, North Korea has again carried out this outrageous conduct.\n\n“Now is the time when the international community is required to unite against North Korea’s provocative acts, which threaten world peace,” Abe told reporters shortly after arriving back in Tokyo from a trip to India. “We must make North Korea understand that if it continues down this road, it will not have a bright future.”\n\n\n\nThe US defence secretary, James Mattis, said North Korea’s latest “reckless act” had “put millions of Japanese in duck and cover”.\n\n\n\nAsked about a possible US military response, Mattis said: “I don’t want to talk on that yet”, adding that Donald Trump had been briefed on the launch.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing objected to North Korea’s latest launch but believed diplomacy was the only way to solve the “complicated, sensitive and grim” problem.\n\n\n\n“The top priority is now to prevent any provocative acts,” Hua told reporters.\n\n\n\nBut Hua rejected the theory - advanced, among others, by Trump and Theresa May - that Beijing held the key to thwarting Kim Jong-un’s nuclear and missile ambitious.\n\n\n\n“China is not the focus. China is not the driving force behind the escalating situation. And China is not the key to resolving the issue,” Hua said.\n\n\n\nHua said China had already made “great sacrifices” and “paid a high price” in its bid to help rein in Pyongyang: “China’s willingness and its efforts to fulfill its relevant international responsibilities cannot be questioned.”\n\n\n\nIn an online editorial, the Communist party-controlled Global Times newspaper, said it was the US and South Korea, not China, that needed “to guide North Korea into a new strategic direction” through dialogue.\n\n\n\n“An isolated North Korea will be more rational if the international society treats it in a rational way,” argued the newspaper, which sometimes reflects official views. It said attempts to intimidate North Korea with threats or shows of force would fail.\n\n“This morning, South Korea launched two missiles in immediate response to North Korea’s launch. This will only encourage the North. Does Seoul truly believe that its missiles will scare Pyongyang?”\n\nChinese experts believe significant new steps from Beijing are out of the question. “I don’t expect China to make any radical [moves],” said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at Beijing’s Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy.\n\n\n\n“According to the data we already [have] it looks like a similar missile to the [Hwasong-12] that North Korea launched on 29 August: a similar missile, a similar range, a similar trajectory. In other words, it wasn’t that big a provocation, just a repetition of a previous action … Of course it overflew Japan – that is serious – but, again, it is not the first time in the last month that North Korea did this.”\n\nBeijing would also believe that recent UN sanctions should be given time to take effect before further action was needed. Zhao said: “We have already got two new UN security council resolutions in just over one month. Very radical measures were adopted. So I don’t expect China to respond with any additional radical measures.”\n\nNorth Korea test-fired two intercontinental ballistic missiles believed capable of reaching the US mainland in July; and late last month it sent an intermediate-range missile over the same region of northern Japan where alerts were sounded on Friday morning.\n\nSouth Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, called an emergency meeting of his national security council, while the South demonstrated its own firepower by conducting a ballistic missile launch off the east coast of the Korean peninsula.\n\nPlay Video 0:25 South Korea tests missiles in response to North's new launch\n\nSouth Korea’s foreign ministry said the missile test was a “very serious and grave challenge” to global security and urged the North to abandon its quest to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\n“North Korea should clearly realise that its abandonment of nuclear and missile development is the only way to guarantee its security and economic development,” the ministry said, adding that Pyongyang should “stop reckless provocations immediately and come to the path of dialogue for denuclearisation as soon as possible”.\n\nSoon after Friday’s launch, the US Pacific Command said it believed North Korea had fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said the missile was launched from Sunan, the location of Pyongyang’s international airport.\n\nNorth Korea used the airport to fire a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile that flew over northern Japan last month – an act it said was a “meaningful prelude” to containing the US Pacific island territory of Guam and carrying out more ballistic missile launches towards the Pacific.\n\nThe South Korean and US militaries were analysing details of the launch but the projectile appears to have flown higher and further than the missile that passed over the same region of Japan at the end of August.\n\nInitial data said the missile flew 3,700km (2,300 miles) and reached an altitude of 770km – signs that North Korea is continuing to make progress towards its aim of perfecting a missile capable of striking the US mainland. The missile landed in the Pacific Ocean about 2,000km east of Hokkaido’s Cape Erimo. The previous launch landed in the Pacific about 1,180km east of Cape Erimo.\n\nJapan’s J-Alert warning system advised people living below the missile’s flight path on the northern island of Hokkaido to seek shelter. Japan’s self-defence forces did not attempt to shoot down the missile and there were no reports of damage from falling debris.\n\nNorth Korea has recently stepped up pressure on Japan over its unwavering support for US-led sanctions. On Thursday the regime threatened to sink Japan and reduce the US to “ashes and darkness” for supporting last week’s UN security council resolution.\n\n\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the US general who oversees America’s nuclear forces said he was making the assumption that North Korea did in fact test a hydrogen bomb on 3 September, crossing a key threshold in its weapons development efforts.\n\nAlthough Pyongyang immediately claimed that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, the US had previously declined to characterise it.\n\nAir Force General John Hyten, the head of the US military’s strategic command, however, said that, as a military officer responsible for responding to the test, he had to assume it was a hydrogen bomb based on the size of the blast and the fact there was a secondary explosion.\n\n“I’m assuming it was a hydrogen bomb,” Hyten told a small group of reporters who were accompanying Mattis on a trip to Hyten’s headquarters in Nebraska. “I have to make that assumption as a military officer.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Wang Zhen in Beijing","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/14/north-korean-launches-unidentified-missile","1505361600.0"
"10-Year-Old Girl Is Detained By Border Patrol After Emergency Surgery\n10-Year-Old Girl Is Detained By Border Patrol After Emergency Surgery\n\nUpdated at 8 p.m. ET\n\nImmigrant advocates are protesting the Border Patrol's apprehension this week of a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy in the country illegally, after she was operated on at a Texas hospital.\n\nFederal immigration officers intercepted the child as she and an adult cousin, who is a U.S. citizen, were in an ambulance being transferred between two hospitals so that she could receive emergency gallbladder surgery.\n\nRosa Maria Hernandez was brought to the United States illegally from Mexico in 2007 when she was 3 months old, according to her mother, Felipa de la Cruz, to get access to better medical care. The family lives in Laredo, Texas, and all are undocumented.\n\nThe girl was traveling in an ambulance — accompanied by her cousin — to Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi on Tuesday when federal immigration officers stopped the vehicle at a checkpoint.\n\nThe Border Patrol agents followed the ambulance to the hospital. According to the family's lawyer, Leticia Gonzalez, the agents insisted the door to her hospital room be left open at all times to keep an eye on her.\n\nOn Wednesday, the hospital discharged Rosa Maria. The lawyer, reading the discharge papers on a conference call with reporters, said doctors recommended the child be released to 'a family member who is familiar with her medical and psychological needs.'\n\nBut officers decided to transport the girl to a government-contracted juvenile shelter in San Antonio, 150 miles from Laredo, and put her into deportation proceedings.\n\nThe Border Patrol defends its actions at the checkpoint, the hospital and the youth shelter. Dan Hetlage, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, says throughout the two-day incident, agents were just enforcing federal immigration law.\n\n'The agent is wrong if he lets her go. We don't have the discretion. It's not a traffic ticket. We follow the letter of the law,' he said.\n\n'It's frustrating for us,' he continued, 'I'm a human being. The agents are trying to do their job as humanely as possible.'\n\nThe Border Patrol defends its agents, saying they escorted Rosa Maria to the children's hospital to ensure she received appropriate medical care and then processed her according to U.S. immigration laws.\n\nImmigrant advocates are calling it the latest outrage under President Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio condemned the agents' actions, saying they treated the sick girl like 'a hardened convict' when she posed 'no threat to national security. ... This apprehension occurred despite the fact that the sensitive locations policy is still in effect. And remember they were staked outside the hospital room.'\n\nOfficers are discouraged from conducting enforcement actions at or near so-called sensitive locations unless the arrest is related to national security, terrorism or public safety. More than 100 Democrats in Congress have demanded that the Department of Homeland Security rein in immigration agents making an increasing number of arrests at or near hospitals, churches and schools.\n\nThe Border Patrol insists it apprehended Rosa Maria at the checkpoint, not the hospital, and the checkpoint is not considered a sensitive location.\n\nAstrid Dominguez, of the ACLU of Texas, says, 'Rosa Maria shouldn't spend one more day away from her parents. We are outraged that the Trump administration and Border Patrol would go after a child like Rosa Maria.'\n\nIn an open letter addressed to the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary, Elaine Duke, the advocacy group DreamActivist says Rosa Maria was told 'she has two options; sign voluntary departure or spend up to 3 weeks in detention.'\n\n'Families should not have to decide between getting life saving help, or being deported,' the group said in the letter.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/26/560149316/10-year-old-girl-is-detained-by-ice-officers-after-emergency-surgery","1508990400.0"

The Hongdae district, one of the most crowded tourist spots in Seoul, was in high spirits with the unexpected entrance of the North Korean leader that Halloween.\n\nFacebook and Twitter got flooded with pictures and videos of Kim. And, since then, some people call Dragon Kim the ‘Hongdae Kim Jong Un.’\n\nSince that debut as a Kim Jong Un impersonator, Kim has been active in front of the camera. He modelled in an online commercial for an air purifier the following year and has made guest appearances in soap operas and music videos.\n\nIn April, Kim showed up as a special guest on a talk show in South Korea for North Korean defectors. The show, called 'On My Way to Meet You,' invites defectors living in South Korea to open up about their lives back in the North and how they are adapting to a new way of life in the South.\n\nWhen Kim emerged, defectors appearing on the show almost jumped out of their skin. Kim entertained the audience with some of the newest dance moves and mimicked Kim Jong Un’s speaking habits.\n\nDragon Kim also visited New York in October and worked on a short video with the You-Tuber QPark.

"Teen girl files claim against police who mistook her for a black male suspect and punched her\nNearly three months later, Tatyana Hargrove still can’t talk about what happened to her on June 18 without tearing up.\n\nIt had been a sweltering Sunday when, on a bike ride back from shopping for a Father’s Day gift, Hargrove was suddenly stopped by police officers in Bakersfield, Calif.\n\nThe officers had been looking for a suspect — described as a 25- to 30-year-old, bald black man standing 5 feet 10 and weighing about 170 pounds — who had threatened several people with a machete at a nearby grocery store, according to a police report.\n\nThinking she was that man — and despite her protests — the officers seized on the 5-foot-2, 115-pound Hargrove, in an altercation that escalated until police punched her in the mouth, unleashed a K-9 dog on her and arrested her. It wasn’t until officers placed her in their patrol car that they asked Hargrove’s name and realized she was female — and thus not the suspect they were looking for.\n\nThough police later admitted it was a case of mistaken identity, Hargrove was charged with resisting or delaying an officer and aggravated assault on an officer. It wasn’t until August that those charges against her were dropped, her attorney said.\n\n“It changed me. Very bad,” Hargrove, 19, said last week at a news conference. “My friends tell me I’m different.”\n\nThat’s about as far as she was able to get before breaking down crying.\n\n“I hope and I pray this doesn’t happen to anybody else,” she said through tears.\n\nFrustrated with what they say has been a lack of accountability for the officers’ actions, Hargrove is filing a claim against the city of Bakersfield. A precursor to a lawsuit, the claim will almost certainly lead to legal action against the city.\n\nNeil K. Gehlawat, Hargrove’s attorney, said this option was the only way they felt they could bring justice in this case. Only the district attorney’s office or a U.S. attorney’s office has the ability to punish the officers, he added, but there was “virtually zero percent chance” they would.\n\n“Our job is to hold the officers accountable for what happened and all the law allows us to do is to seek money,” Gehlawat said. “But our hope is that, by going through this process and by potentially having this case heard by a jury, that they will send a loud and clear message to the officers in the department that what happened is not appropriate and it should not happen again.”\n\nBakersfield police spokesman Ryan Kroeker said the department is aware a claim was filed and had been expecting it, but did not comment further. In July, a police spokesman told The Washington Post the department had determined the officers had exercised appropriate use of force on Hargrove.\n\nGehlawat said the Bakersfield police chief did call Hargrove and her parents to apologize for what happened, but also suggested Hargrove should have complied before complaining.\n\n“Which I think is just victim-blaming,” Gehlawat said.\n\nIn a widely shared video of Hargrove’s account of the incident, filmed by the Bakersfield chapter of the NAACP in July, the teenager stands with a pair of crutches near the intersection where she was stopped by police and described how one of the officers demanded she give him her backpack, she said.\n\nWhen she asked if they had a warrant, one of the officers gestured toward a police K-9 behind him, she said.\n\n“I then got scared and then I was like, here, take the backpack, just take the backpack,” Hargrove added.\n\nAfter that, she said in the video, the officer grabbed her by her wrist, then punched her and threw her onto the ground; shortly afterward, the police K-9 “came and started eating at my leg.”\n\nThe same officer then put his knee on her back and other knee against her head, despite her protests, she said.\n\n“I told him ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe’ and then I started yelling out, ‘Somebody help me, somebody help me! They’re gonna kill me!’” she said. “And then finally, he let me up, he tied my hands behind my back and then he tied my feet together and he threw me in the back of the car.”\n\nHargrove was arrested and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of her injuries, including abrasions on her face and scrapes and punctures from the police K-9’s “engagement on her right thigh,” Christopher Moore, the arresting officer, wrote in his police report.\n\nMoore wrote that “several nurses” at the hospital referred to Hargrove as a male and that “when I corrected them and advised she was a female they were surprised and apologized for the mistake.”\n\nAfter she was treated for her injuries, Hargrove was booked into jail, the report said. She was detained for nearly 16 hours there before being bailed out by her parents, according to the NAACP.\n\nIn the police report, Moore wrote that Hargrove had “spun into” one of the officers with her left shoulder, causing him to fall backward, and then “quickly maneuvered her body to get back on top of him” after the officer punched her.\n\n“At this time I was forced to quickly consider the following; [Hargrove] matched the description of the suspect that had brandished a machete, her backpack was within her arm’s reach and the main compartment was unzipped allowing her immediate access to the machete,” Moore wrote. After weighing whether he could use his Taser or baton on Hargrove, Moore wrote that he decided to unleash the police K-9, Hamer.\n\nIn the police report, Moore wrote that after officers placed Hargrove in a police car, she continued to scream out of the window at them for about five minutes.\n\n“While Hargrove was in the back seat I asked what her name was and when she provided it as ‘Tatyana’ I said, ‘Don’t lie to me, that’s a girl’s name. What is your name?’ ” the police report stated. “Hargrove said, ‘I’m a girl, I just don’t dress like one.’ This was when I first discovered she was a female.”\n\nA search of her backpack revealed no weapons, the report stated.\n\nThe claim against Bakersfield alleges police used “excessive and unreasonable force” against Hargrove, as well as civil rights violations under federal and state law.\n\n“One of the questions in my mind is, even if this case is a case of mistaken identity, why didn’t they do more to ascertain her identity prior to using excessive force?” Gehlawat said.\n\nHe described the impossible situation Hargrove had been put in to reporters last week: “She tried to get the dog off of her. The officers described that as her not being compliant, but I bet that if any one of us had a canine biting onto some part of our body, our natural instinct might be to try to get the dog off of us so that the dog wouldn’t keep biting us.”\n\nThough there is no fixed dollar amount attached to the claim, Gehlawat said Hargrove “deserves to be compensated for physical injuries and the emotional toll this has taken,” as well as medical bills and lost wages.\n\nShe has continued to see doctors about the injury to her right leg, which causes her to have trouble standing for longer than 15 minutes at a time, he added. Since the incident, Hargrove has not been able to return to her job at Little Caesars, where she was a team leader.\n\nAt the news conference last week, Hargrove said she has become “very paranoid,” reclusive, and won’t allow her parents to leave windows or doors unlocked.\n\n“Her parents say that she used to be independent,” he said. “But now, around patrol vehicles, lights, sirens, she’s fearful … which is understandable because, the last time that happened, before she knew it an officer was pointing his gun at her and they had a canine biting her leg.”\n\nRead more:\n\n‘I think I did it’: Man tells 911 he took cold medicine, woke up to find wife stabbed to death\n\nA Utah nurse’s violent arrest puts patient-consent law — and police conduct — in the spotlight\n\nA cop stopped a car for speeding — then pointed a gun at a passenger for more than 9 minutes","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/05/teen-girl-files-claim-against-police-who-mistook-her-for-a-black-male-suspect-and-punched-her/","1504584000.0"

"Russian Navy Activity in Europe Now at Cold-War Levels: Admiral\nThis build-up has coincided with a rapid deterioration in Washington-Moscow relations following Russia's annexation of Crimea and alleged backing of pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\n'They’re a global navy, I understand that. But the activity in this theater has substantially moved up in the last couple of years,' she told the news agency.\n\nHoward is NATO's Allied Joint Force Command in Naples and commands U.S. naval forces in Europe and Africa.\n\nHer comments came after the U.S. launched cruise missiles against a Syrian airbase it said was involved in a chemical attack on civilians that left dozens dead.\n\nEarly Saturday, around 36 hours after the American strike, the Russian military announced it had diverted one of its own cruise missile-armed warships from naval exercises in the neighboring Black Sea to join its battle group in the Mediterranean.\n\n'The ship will operate in the region in accordance to the changing military situation,' according to the state-owned news agency Sputnik.

"Police say they shot two dogs who ‘charged’ at an officer. Then the homeowner posted her video.\nVideo of the shooting recorded by an overhead security camera has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook. (Jennifer LeMay)\n\nBefore the gunfire, the injured dogs and the accusations of police misconduct, the home security video makes one thing clear: In the gated back yard, the animals and the officer are surprised to see each other.\n\nThat Saturday night interaction — an officer-involved shooting that left two emotional-support dogs seriously injured — has embroiled the Minneapolis Police Department in controversy.\n\nVideo of the shooting recorded by an overhead security camera has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, including by many animal lovers who are calling for the officer’s badge.\n\nThe dogs — Ciroc and Rocko — are both Staffordshire terriers that Jennifer LeMay and her children have had since they were puppies, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. They’re emotional support dogs for LeMay’s two sons, who both suffer from anxiety.\n\nAccording to the Star Tribune, a friend had been dog-sitting while LeMay and her two daughters were camping. But the trio decided to come home early, and one daughter accidentally triggered the home’s alarm system Saturday night. They called the alarm company, which canceled the alert, but the police were already on their way.\n\nOn scene, one officer stayed at the front of the house, the newspaper reported, and another hopped the fence and began looking around the back.\n\nThere’s no sound in the video, which LeMay ultimately posted to Facebook.\n\nIn the video, the officer has already hopped the fence into the yard and briefly steps out of the camera frame as he investigates.\n\nWhen he appears again, he’s backpedaling and his gun is raised. The reason for the retreat becomes obvious a few seconds later: A gray and white dog pads into the camera frame.\n\nIts tail is wagging as it closes the distance to the officer, who has his back to the locked gate. The dog appears distracted and doesn’t beeline for the officer. As it closes to within a few feet, the officer fires a single shot. The dog jumps back, falls and rolls on the ground as it tries to get away.\n\nAround that time, a second dog, Rocko, enters the frame. The officer fires at the second dog, and it sprints away.\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department released a statement confirming that the incident happened but did not try to explain the officer’s thinking or rationale for firing. The department also didn’t identify the officer.\n\n“Anytime an officer discharges their firearm in the line of duty there is an investigation that is completed by the Minneapolis Police Department’s Internal Affairs Unit,” the statement said. “We are in the process of reviewing the video posted online, as well as the officer’s body camera video. We have reached out to the owner of the dogs and will continue to do so during the investigation.”\n\nA police report obtained by the Star Tribune said the dogs charged at the officer.\n\n“While staging at the rear, two large-size pit bulls charged at officer,” the police report narrative said. “Officer dispatched the two dogs, causing them to run back into the residence.”\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau released a statement Monday afternoon saying the department was “implementing updated mandatory training” about officer-dog encounters.\n\n“I’ve watched the video, and as someone whose family has included dogs most of my life, I can say that it was difficult to watch,” the statement said. “This was an outcome that no one wanted. I’ve asked for an Internal Affairs use of force review. We are reaching out to the family to help them with the veterinary care bills to ensure that both dogs are adequately taken care of.”\n\nStill, LeMay was livid. She declined to be interviewed for this story Monday afternoon, saying “I’ve lawyered up.” Her attorney did not immediately respond to a message.\n\nBut she raged about the incident on Facebook.\n\n“Xfinity home central services and 4th precinct can expect to be seeing and hearing from my lawyer bright n early monday morning,” she said on Facebook. “I WILL GET F‑‑‑‑‑‑ JUSTICE FOR MY KIDS! THERE IS NO PENNY OR DOLLAR VALUE TOO WHAT THESE BABIES MEAN TO MY FAMILY, EXTENDED FAMILY, FRIENDS OR ANYONE WHOS LIVES THEYVE BRIGHTENED DAILY! #knowthat”\n\nShe told Minneapolis CBS-affiliate WCCO that she’d racked up thousands of dollars in veterinary bills and posted pictures of her dogs’ conditions: Ciroc wrapped in a cone and with bandages on an injured jaw; Rocko with surgical drainage tubes on a stitched belly.\n\nWorsening things, Lemay told the Star Tribune that her daughter had watched the family’s dogs being shot from an upstairs window.\n\nThe incident comes as police are under increased scrutiny for their use of force and fatal confrontations with people.\n\nLemay started a GoFundMe to cover her dogs’ medical bills. It has raised more than $21,000 and been shared by thousands.\n\n“Lord Jesus please make sure my fur babies pull thru this after these trigger happy b‑‑‑‑‑‑‑ tried to take their life!

"'Heat-not-burn' cigarettes still release cancer-causing chemicals\n(Reuters Health) - - A new type of “heat-not-burn” cigarette releases some of the same cancer-causing chemicals found in traditional cigarette smoke, a recent experiment suggests.\n\nResearchers analyzed the chemical compounds and nicotine in smoke from traditional cigarettes and from the new devices, which are designed to heat disposable tobacco sticks and give users the taste of tobacco without the smoke or ash.\n\nThe smoke released by this “heat-not-burn” cigarette had 84 percent of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nHeat-not-burn cigarettes also released chemicals linked to cancer including carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\n\nThe research team was surprised to find that heat-not-burn cigarettes “released some of these chemicals in much higher concentrations that conventional cigarettes,” said lead study author Dr. Reto Auer of the University of Bern in Switzerland.\n\n“We need more studies to find out about the health consequences” of smoking heat-not-burn cigarettes, Auer said by email.\n\n“However, there is no safe minimum limit for some of the chemicals” in heat-not-burn cigarette smoke, Auer added, “and some of these chemicals may contribute to the high mortality rate of smokers.”\n\nTo see how heat-not-burn cigarettes compared to conventional cigarettes in terms of chemicals released, Auer and colleagues analyzed the smoke from Lucky Strike Blue Lights and the newer alternative tobacco devices using a smoking device developed to capture fumes from traditional and electronic cigarettes.\n\nThey looked at the contents of the I-Quit-Ordinary Smoking (IQOS) product from Philip Morris International with an IQOS holder, IQOS pocket charger, Marlboro HeatSticks regular and Heets.\n\nWhile more studies are needed to determine the long-term health effects of heat-not-burn cigarettes, their use should be restricted until more is known about them, Auer argues.\n\n“Harmful chemicals were present in IQOS smoke, though in lower concentrations, on average,” Auer said. “We need to conduct more studies to find out whether IQOS are safer for users or bystanders.”\n\nBased on their findings, the authors conclude that heated tobacco products should fall under the same indoor smoking bans in place for conventional cigarettes to prevent bystanders from breathing the fumes.\n\nThat’s because the new tobacco products threaten the progress that has been made on decreasing the harms of second-hand smoke, because existing bans may not apply to heat-not-burn cigarettes, Dr. Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine wrote in an editor’s note accompanying the study.\n\n“There is concern that heat-not-burn tobacco will skirt local ordinances that prevent smoking in public areas,” Katz, director of the Los Angeles County Health Agency, said by email.\n\n“This would harm public health by eroding social norms about the use of tobacco,” Katz added. “In addition, the article demonstrates that heat-not-burn products release carcinogens, so the use of these products in public space would harm the health of both the user and those around the user.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2qsh1nH JAMA Internal Medicine, online May 22, 2017.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-tobacco-heatnotburn-idUSKBN18M2JB","1495832567.0"
"Texas church gunman escaped mental health facility in 2012 after threatening military superiors\nNEW BRAUNFELS, Tex. — The gunman who killed more than two dozen people in a small church outside San Antonio on Sunday had a string of troubling episodes in recent years, including an escape from a mental health facility in 2012 after he was caught sneaking guns onto an Air Force base “attempting to carry out death threats” against military superiors, according to a police report.\n\nDevin P. Kelley’s young life was riddled with warning signs, mounting during and after his time in the Air Force, including a conviction for beating his then-wife and stepson, charges of animal cruelty, mental health concerns, investigations for domestic assault, threats against his family members and a motorcycle crash that left him with lingering physical pain.\n\nInterviews and police and military documents depict Kelley as a distressed — and at-times, violent — man in the years before authorities said he walked into the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., and fired round after round into the congregation gathered for Sunday morning services.\n\n[The sound of hymns drifted from the country church. Then came gunfire.]\n\nPolice in El Paso, reported that five years before the church massacre, officers were dispatched to a bus terminal after Kelley escaped from a nearby behavioral facility. Officers wrote they were told Kelley, who was serving in the Air Force, “was a danger to himself and others” at the time and “was also facing military criminal charges.” While it is unclear why Kelley was at the behavioral facility and whether he ever faced military discipline for the threats, he was court-martialed that same year and convicted of abusing his wife and stepson.\n\nBut the Air Force has acknowledged that it did not tell federal authorities about the domestic violence conviction, which should have prevented him from buying firearms, and the revelations about Kelley’s stint in a mental health facility and making threats against his superiors raised new questions about the service’s handling of Kelley and his discharge.\n\nThe Air Force is investigating the lack of reporting of Kelley’s conviction to a national crime database, and an Air Force spokeswoman did not immediately provide additional information about the threats and 2012 escape.\n\nAuthorities, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), have questioned how it was possible for Kelley to have passed background checks for jobs and gun purchases, checks that should have made it difficult for him to obtain the weapons he used in Sunday’s slaughter. The domestic violence conviction should have raised red flags as he purchased four guns, one in each of the past four years.\n\n[The lives lost in the Sutherland Springs church shooting]\n\nDomestic concerns appeared to follow Kelley through two marriages. His first marriage ended in divorce after he was jailed for abusing his wife, and authorities said domestic problems involving Kelley’s in-laws — officials said he had been sending his mother-in-law threatening texts — preceded his attack on the church his wife’s family attended.\n\nKelley’s anger exploded outward on Sunday when Texas law enforcement officials said he targeted the small church outside San Antonio “with a purpose and a mission.”\n\nOne woman who was wounded during the carnage said Kelley fired at churchgoers who tried to leave and pumped bullets into those cowering or wounded on the church’s floor. David Brown, whose mother, Farida, was shot in her legs, said she described Kelley firing four shots into the torso of a woman on her left.\n\n“With every shot, she was crying,” Brown said of the woman. “She was just staring at my mom while she tried to comfort her.” As he fired rounds into the woman, Farida Brown held her hand, telling her she was heading to heaven.\n\nAuthorities said they were still reconstructing what happened inside the church, and are unable to say how long the gunman fired or how many shots were fired — he reloaded several times and appeared to have emptied 15 magazines, which could mean several hundred shots. They said he spent considerable time firing at churchgoers, first shooting at the front and side of the building before heading inside and continuing his rampage.\n\n“When the first call came in, the Wilson County Sheriff’s Office arrived within four minutes,” Freeman Martin, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a briefing Tuesday. “I can tell you four minutes is a long time during an active-shooter situation.”\n\nWhen the gunfire ended, nearly everyone inside had been injured or killed, Martin said. Officials said the 26 people killed included the unborn child of a pregnant woman who was killed. Another 20 people were injured, and half of them remained in critical condition Tuesday.\n\nKelley, who was shot twice by a local man who heard what was happening at the church and responded, fled and shot himself in the head about 10 miles from the church, officials said.\n\nInvestigators have not publicly identified a motive for the shooting, but they pointed to Kelley’s rage at his own relatives, particularly his mother-in-law, who attended the church but was not there during the massacre. “We know there was conflict,” Martin said. “He was upset with the mother-in-law.”\n\nKelley’s mother-in-law told a local schoolteacher, Tambria Read, 59, that even with the familial strife, she was shocked by what Kelley had done. Kelley had visited the church with his family five days ahead of the attack, attending a fall festival, an event conceived as an alternative to Halloween. Members of the church and their children appeared at the event in costume.\n\n“She said that she did not think he would do anything like this,” Read said Tuesday. “She said they were having family issues and they thought things were getting better, that there was improvement in the relationship in the family because he had taken the children to the fall festival.”\n\nAttempts to reach Kelley’s mother-in-law have been unsuccessful.\n\n[After massacre, some residents call for more guns and not more gun control]\n\nMartin said law enforcement officials believe further details about the dispute might be found on Kelley’s cellphone. The FBI said Tuesday that while they have obtained the phone and brought it to their facility in Quantico, Va., they have been unable to access its data.\n\nFederal authorities have been critical of the encryption they say has kept them off of devices crucial to investigations, an issue that notably flared into a lengthy dispute between the FBI and Apple over an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers; the bureau later said an outside group helped them unlock that device.\n\nChristopher H. Combs, special agent in charge of the FBI’s San Antonio division, said the FBI had never investigated Kelley before Sunday’s attack. But Kelley had repeatedly come to the attention of local and military authorities in Texas and New Mexico.\n\nIn June 2012, the El Paso police were called to the Greyhound bus station there in response to a missing person, according to a police report first obtained Tuesday by two Texas television stations, KVIA in El Paso and KPRC in Houston.\n\nOfficers wrote that they were told Kelley, at the time serving at Holloman Air Force Base, had escaped from Peak Behavioral Health Services, a facility just over the border in New Mexico, and intended to hop a bus out of town.\n\n\n\nA teddy bear lies under police tape at a makeshift memorial for those killed in the shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland, Tex. (Rick Wilking/Reuters)\n\nThat same year, Kelley was court-martialed by the Air Force. He was charged with abusing his wife and her son — including a serious head injury to the toddler — between April 2011 and April 2012 and sentenced in November 2012, according to Air Force documents. Because the Air Force does not operate prisons, Kelley served his sentence at a Navy brig in San Diego.\n\nAt the time of Kelley’s May 2014 discharge, his duty title was “prisoner,” according to the Air Force.\n\nLocal police also encountered him when he returned to South Texas. Deputies with the Comal County Sheriff’s Office in Texas were called to Kelley’s house 17 times over the years, Sheriff Mark Reynolds said in an interview Tuesday. Most calls were for loose livestock and brush fires, but two of them “raised flags,” the sheriff said.\n\nIn June 2013, Kelley was accused of sexual assault, but details of the case are being withheld because it is still open and under investigation — although Reynolds acknowledged there appeared to be little follow-up by investigators after October 2013. In February 2014, officers were again called to the home to investigate a disturbance. A friend of Kelley’s then-girlfriend, who he later married, summoned law enforcement saying that she had received a text alleging abuse at the home. Police found no evidence of abuse and Kelley’s girlfriend denied anything had happened.\n\n“Officers thought, ‘Maybe this is just a misunderstanding and teenage drama,” Reynolds said. “They didn’t see anything that substantiated that type of abuse.”\n\nAround the same time as that episode, Kelley was involved in a motorcycle crash that, he wrote on Facebook, left him with neck and head pain up until his final days. He had been riding a 2009 Harley Davidson down a four-lane county road in New Braunfels when 91-year-old Bessie Mulhollan pulled her Buick out in front of him, according to police records.\n\n“She was pulling out of a parking lot and didn’t see him,” said Beth Hawes Mulhollan, the woman’s daughter-in-law, who was not present for the accident but was told about it later by Bessie, who died in 2015. “He ended up running right into the side of her car.”\n\nPolice records say Kelley was treated at the scene of the crash but that he declined further medical aid.\n\n[The persistent crime that connects mass shooters: Domestic violence]\n\nJust days before the shooting rampage, Kelley posted messages on Facebook complaining about lingering neck pain from the crash. The posts were shared with The Post by a Facebook friend of Kelley’s who took screenshots before his page was taken down.\n\n“My motorcycle injury in my neck is acting up again,” Kelley wrote on Facebook last week. “4 years later it still causes me major neck pain.”\n\nIn another post, the day before the shooting, he added: “Damn,” with a frowning emoticon. “My heads been hurting for 3 days now.”\n\nOn the morning of the shooting, he posted: “I’m a wreck.”\n\nIn Comal County’s court records, a little yellow flag is posted on Kelley’s electronic file, denoting that he has psychiatric issues. It was not immediately clear when the flag was added — Cecilia Delgado with the district clerk’s office said the flag dates back to at least 2012, when the courthouse moved to a new computer system. The system is only countywide, and individuals are typically flagged upon entering the county’s jail.\n\nKelley was flagged by the Comal County Sheriff’s Office, Delgado said, but Reynolds confirmed that Kelley had never entered the jail and was not immediately sure when the flag was added.\n\n“We’re taught to look for the flags,” Reynolds said.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nSutherland Springs pastor: ‘I don’t understand, but I know my God does’\n\nThe violent past of the Sutherland Springs attacker\n\nBerman and Lowery reported from Washington.

"Can Angela Merkel survive Germany's political crisis?\nBreaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE\n\nAngela Merkel has hinted that another election might have to be held after the collapse of coalition talks put her fourth term as German chancellor in doubt — a political crisis that has caused consternation across Europe.\n\nMerkel said she was 'very skeptical' about leading a minority government to run Europe's biggest economy and thinks another trip to the ballot box would be a better solution.\n\nThe uncharacteristic disarray — Germany hasn’t had a post-election minority government since World War II — comes as Europe grapples with instability from Brexit, immigration and the rising threat from the far-right.\n\n“We now face a situation that we haven't had in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, so in nearly 70 years,' President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters Monday.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and the chair of the CDU youth organization, Paul Ziemiak, speak during a session of parliament in Berlin on Tuesday. Clemens Bilan / EPA\n\nSteinmeier, who will ultimately decide whether to pave the way for a minority government or a new election, appeared to rule out the latter option until further negotiations had been exhausted.\n\n'There would be incomprehension and great concern inside and outside our country, and particularly in our European neighborhood, if the political forces in the biggest and economically strongest country in Europe of all places didn't fulfill their responsibility,' he said.\n\nMerkel took power in 2005 and is affectionately known in Germany as “Mutti” — or 'Mother.' While the 63-year-old remains personally popular, her Christian Democratic Union party lost more seats than expected in September’s election and is now forced to team up with smaller parties to govern.\n\nIn the past, forming a coalition hasn’t been too contentious. This time, that’s not the case.\n\nMerkel, a conservative, spent four weeks haggling with the pro-business Free Democrats and the traditionally left-leaning Greens on a new, untried alliance until the Free Democrats walked out of talks Sunday night.\n\n'She has outsmarted people over and over again' 'She has outsmarted people over and over again'\n\n“Germans have always amused themselves with inability of other European governments to come to stable majorities, and now we are in that situation ourselves, which is quite new,” said Josef Janning, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and the head of its Berlin office.\n\nHaving served as the voice of reason and caution to its European neighbors in the past, Germany is now the subject of concern just as the 28-nation European Union embarks on complex and tense negotiations over Britain’s withdrawal.\n\n'It's bad news for Europe that the government in Germany will take a little longer,' Dutch Foreign Minister Halbe Zijlstra said Monday. 'Germany is a very influential country within the E.U., so if they don't have a government and therefore don't have a mandate, it'll be very hard for them to take positions.'\n\nThe far-right nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), which emerged from September's election as the third-biggest party with around 13 percent of the vote, was quick to exploit the crisis.\n\n'Merkel has failed,' party co-leader Alexander Gauland said. 'We think it's time for her to go.'\n\nHowever, analysts pointed to Merkel’s political agility and pragmatism.\n\n“Throughout her career people have always underestimated her,” said Marcel Dirsus, a political scientist at the University of Kiel.\n\n“She’s not a presence that lights up a room, but she has outsmarted people over and over again. She’s still extremely popular and there’s no appetite for her to go, at least not in the wider population.”\n\nGerman Meltdown: Everyone Loses in Coalition Collapse https://t.co/C0fSiDyzLE pic.twitter.com/pelvdoeDJP — SPIEGEL English (@SPIEGEL_English) November 20, 2017\n\nMany Germans were dismayed about the inability of their political leaders to form a government.\n\nElmar Thevessen, the deputy editor-in-chief of German broadcaster ZDF, said that when voters went to the ballot box they knew that a multiparty coalition was likely and 'compromises would be needed.'\n\n'To find them is the utmost responsibility in a democracy,“ Thevessen wrote in a commentary titled 'The Spiritless.'\n\nHe added, 'The future is only better than before, if we have the courage to positively shape it.'\n\nIf the deadlock continues, Steinmeier would have to propose a chancellor to Parliament, who must win a majority of all lawmakers to be elected. Assuming that fails, Parliament has 14 days to elect a candidate of its own choosing by an absolute majority. And if that fails, Steinmeier would then propose a candidate who could be elected by a plurality of lawmakers.\n\nSteinmeier would then have to decide whether to appoint a minority government or dissolve Parliament, triggering an election within 60 days. Merkel's two-party Union bloc is easily the biggest group in Parliament, but is 109 seats short of a majority.\n\nA new election may produce an equally awkward situation, with polls so far suggesting results would be similar to last time.\n\nWhile Germany’s power vacuum is unusual, Merkel’s difficulties are not a political revolution in the mold of the Brexit referendum or the victory of President Donald Trump, said Dirsus, the political scientist.\n\n“This is not a seismic shift. It’s a sign that Germany is becoming a bit more normal. All around us in Europe we have a certain amount of political instability. Now we are becoming a more normal European country.”","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/can-angela-merkel-survive-germany-s-political-crisis-n822501","None"
"Why does the Las Vegas shooter's motive even matter?\n(CNN) A week after the Las Vegas shooting, Kevin McMahill, the undersheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, appeared visibly frustrated at a press conference.\n\nAuthorities had run down more than 1,000 leads in the investigation into the October 1 massacre. But they still were struggling to determine why Stephen Paddock fired on a packed crowd of concertgoers, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more. Why was he trying to kill so many people?\n\nMcMahill asked the public to avoid the constant rumor and speculation about Paddock's motives, which he said were understandable but unhelpful.\n\n'I get it,' he said. 'We all want answers.'\n\nA month after the deadly rampage, little has changed in the investigation. Even so, there remains an intense focus on figuring out the shooter's motivation.\n\nBut why exactly? Paddock is dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police are looking to find out if anyone knew of his plans ahead of time, but they have said he acted alone. There will be no criminal case against him. Learning his motivation won't bring back the dead or help heal the nearly 500 wounded.\n\nDoes his motivation even matter? Why do we care so much about the motives of mass shooters?\n\nThe answer, according to experts in profiling mass shooters, is that we dig into the motive of mass killings to try to prevent future attacks, adjust policy and -- perhaps most of all -- satisfy our own human curiosity.\n\n'Everybody is talking about this. Everybody is asking 'Why'd he do it? What's the reason?' ' said Jeffrey Simon, a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of ' Lone Wolf Terrorism: Understanding the Growing Threat .'\n\n'It's just human nature to speculate and want to know why something occurred.'\n\nLessons learned\n\nPeople examine crosses placed near Las Vegas' famous sign after last month's deadly rampage.\n\nFor Mary Ellen O'Toole, a former senior FBI profiler and author of 'The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective,' understanding a mass killer's motives can help stop future attacks.\n\n'I like to think of these things as education,' she said.\n\nThe public has a misunderstanding of how these mass shooters radicalize, she said. In general, they don't suddenly 'snap.' Instead, they slowly radicalize to the point where their brains begin to see other humans as objects and just a means to a desired end.\n\nElliot Rodger, who killed six people at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2014, had written a lengthy manifesto describing plans to kill 'beautiful girls' and 'popular people' after years of rejection and jealousy.\n\nThe 22-year-old Rodger fatally stabbed his three roommates before shooting dead two women outside a sorority house and another man inside a deli. He wounded 13 others during his shooting spree before killing himself.\n\nIf we understand that end goal -- the motive -- then we can better understand how the process of radicalization happened and whether any groups or causes contributed to that. That may help the public better predict who might be at risk for radicalizing and prevent future attacks, O'Toole said.\n\n'I find that this is a teachable moment, and we don't want to lose that opportunity,' she said.\n\nPolicy changes\n\nA killer's motivation can also lead to policy changes, taking on that issue on a local, state or national level.\n\nFor example, Dylann Roof, motivated by white supremacist beliefs, killed nine people in a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.\n\n'I think it's part of human nature,' said Michael Stone, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University who has studied hundreds of mass killings.\n\n'When something terrible happens, you want to know what were the factors that led up to it and whether there's something about it that we could spot beforehand. Maybe we could head trouble off at the pass.'\n\nIn Orlando last year, a gunman's targeted killing of 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub, led to much stronger support for the LGBTQ community, local lawmakers have said\n\n'You always have lessons learned after any kind of incident such as this, whether terrorist-related or not terrorist-related,' Simon said.\n\n'Part of human nature'\n\nPhotos: Mass shooting at Las Vegas music festival Debris is scattered on the ground Monday, October 2, at the site of a country music festival held this past weekend in Las Vegas.

Stone, who wrote the book 'The Anatomy of Evil,' which explores the motivations and mindsets of the world's most prominent killers, said there's a 'fascination' with such people.\n\n'It's very hard to escape the fascination with these mass killers and mass murderers, and also the wish to have answers to what prompts some of these people to do these kinds of things,' he said.\n\nIn general, mass killers, almost all of whom are young men, are motivated by some combination of paranoia and mental illness or financial and social problems, he said. A disgruntled recently fired worker, perhaps, or a jilted lover.\n\nPaddock, though, doesn't seem to fit that type. He was a 64-year-old retired accountant with a girlfriend and plenty of money to spend. Investigators said they hadn't learned anything in his social life, finances or political beliefs that explained his path to radicalization.\n\n'He doesn't fit into the major categories,' Stone said. 'Because Paddock doesn't fit in, he's all the more intriguing. So people are pounding on the table, 'We have to figure this guy out.'

"Foiled! Electrician Used A Snack Bag As A Faraday Cage To Sneak Off The Job\nFoiled! Electrician Used A Snack Bag As A Faraday Cage To Sneak Off The Job\n\nFor a while, Tom Colella had found his escape at the bottom of a bag of crunchy corn snacks. But it was not to last.\n\nEarlier this month in western Australia, the Fair Work Commission, a workplace tribunal, found that the electrician — who was fired last year — had indeed been fired for good cause: He had been ditching work while on the clock, the commission concluded, and had hidden his whereabouts from his employer by MacGyvering a Faraday cage out of an empty bag of Twisties.\n\nBut let's back up a step: A Faraday cage, named for 19th century scientist Michael Faraday, effectively blocks electromagnetic fields. Faraday found that an enclosure — or, in this case, the foil-lined interior of the cheesy corn snack bag — can keep these charges out if there's enough conductive material.\n\nIt appears Colella, 60, had slipped his company-mandated, GPS-enabled personal digital assistant into the bag to block the signals that enabled the device to track his movements.\n\n'As an experienced electrician, Mr Colella knew that this bag would work\n\nas a [Faraday] cage, thereby preventing the PDA from working properly — especially the provision of regular GPS co-ordinate updates,' Fair Work Commissioner Bernie Riordan said in his decision. 'I note that Mr Colella's supervisors knew that he placed his PDA in the foil bag and that they should have known the effect that this action would have on the PDA device.\n\n'However,' Riordan added, 'I can find no plausible explanation why Mr Colella would create a faraday cage around his PDA, except to obstruct the GPS collecting capacity of the device. Mr Colella appears to have been deliberately mischievous in acting in this manner.'\n\nNow, it should be noted Colella isn't the first modern-day Faraday improviser. In fact, the owner of a pub in England tried the same thing, only with his whole bar, lining the ceiling and walls with copper wire and tin foil.\n\n'I think this is gonna be the new way forward for restaurants and bars and clubs,' the pub owner proclaimed last year on Weekend Edition.\n\nAs one might expect, Colella's supervisors proved a little more skeptical. Tipped off by an anonymous note claiming the electrician was golfing while he was supposed to be working, they uncovered what Riordan described as 'a large number of workplace attendance irregularities.'\n\nThat said, partly because of Colella's device, the commissioner noted the GPS information turned out inconclusive in the case against him, saying he was 'not convinced that the PDA GPS data proves anything except that Mr Colella had\n\nfound a way, either inadvertently or otherwise, to function the PDA device whilst not allowing it to record his location.'\n\nStill, the attempts to disguise his location did not inspire confidence — and in the end, the commissioner found his employer had valid reason to fire him.\n\nBut it's not all bad for Colella, who appears to be working as an Uber driver now.\n\n'Mr Colella is a highly experienced and competent electrical/instrument technician,' Riordan said. 'I have no doubt that an experienced dual tradesman would be able to find well paid employment utilizing these skills within Perth's metropolitan area.'\n\nIt's unclear whether he'll want to leave the cheese curls at home next time.","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/27/566764082/foiled-this-faraday-cage-made-from-snack-bag-couldnt-save-electrician-s-job","1511758800.0"

"Coffee, Bees and Climate Change Are Linked In Ways You May Not Have Expected\nCoffee, Bees and Climate Change Are Linked In Ways You May Not Have Expected\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Neil Palmer (CIAT) /University of Vermont Neil Palmer (CIAT) /University of Vermont\n\nPollinators such as bees play a key part of producing the beans that go into your morning cup of coffee.\n\nIn fact, they are responsible for about 20 to 25 percent of coffee production by increasing the plants' yield, Taylor Ricketts, the director of the University of Vermont's Gund Institute for Environment, tells The Two-Way. Bees actually increase the quality of the beans by making their size more uniform.\n\nBut climate change is threatening both pollinators and the areas where coffee can grow. A new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences says it is the first to model the impact of climate change on both coffee and pollinators.\n\nThe researchers projected that by 2050, climate change could reduce the amount of ground usable to grow coffee in Latin America by up to 88 percent. That's significantly higher than previous estimates.\n\n'We've known for a while that climate change is going to mess with agriculture in a lot of ways,' says Ricketts. It will move the areas where both coffee and pollinators live – but not necessarily in the same way.\n\n'These are all individual species that happened to co-occur now,' Ricketts says, but they each have different tolerances to heat. For example, a bee that is at the very edge of its heat tolerance won't follow coffee into warmer areas.\n\nRicketts says the researchers wondered: As the land suitable for growing coffee moves and shrinks, will pollinators 'exacerbate this problem with coffee and climate change or soften the blow?'\n\nUsing computer models, they found that it was a bit of both. Most coffee growing areas are expected to see a reduction in the number of bee species – though about 16 percent of the areas will see more diversity.\n\nThe areas expected to lose the most coffee growing land are in Nicaragua, Honduras and Venezuela. A few areas are actually expected to see slight expansion of land that is suitable for coffee growing, in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia and Costa Rica.\n\n'We're going to lose a lot and not gain too much,' he says.\n\nClimate change will, in places, have opposite impacts on ground suitability and bee diversity. The researchers project that about 34-51 percent of areas will become less suitable to growing coffee but see more bee diversity, somewhat offsetting farmers' losses. The opposite is true in 31-33 percent of future coffee distribution areas.\n\nRicketts stresses that this is not just a discussion about a luxury item, because it is grown by millions of people on small farms in rural areas. 'There is a whole lot more at stake here than, is my nice espresso in New York going to get more expensive? Climate change is going to threaten this primary livelihood for millions of people in vulnerable communities all over the world.'\n\nHere are a few things that Ricketts says would help reduce the blow to coffee farmers impacted by climate change:","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/11/550169720/coffee-bees-and-climate-change-are-linked-in-ways-you-may-not-have-expected","1505102400.0"
"26 dead in shooting at church in Sutherland Springs, Texas\nWhat we know\n\nA gunman opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday\n\n\n\nAt least 26 people were killed and 20 injured\n\n\n\nInformation on the victims is emerging\n\nThe suspect has been identified as Devin Patrick Kelley\n\nTrump says shooting a 'mental health problem,' not a 'guns situation,' but cops give no motive\n\nSUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas -- A gunman opened fire inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs on Sunday, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others, authorities said.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott called the attack the deadliest mass shooting in his state's history. Officials said 23 people were found dead inside the church, two outside, one died after being rushed to a hospital.\n\nThe shooting suspect has been identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, federal law enforcement sources told CBS News.\n\nOn Sunday night, authorities only identified the suspect as a young white male. They said he was seen dressed in all black and tactical gear -- including a 'ballistic vest' -- at a local gas station at 11:20 a.m. He then exited his vehicle, crossed the street and began firing an AR-15 style weapon at the church, officials said. The suspect entered the church and continued to fire.\n\nAs he exited the church, a local resident grabbed his gun and pursued the suspect, who dropped his weapon and fled the scene.\n\nThe suspect was later found dead inside his vehicle. Officials are unsure if he was shot by a resident or suffered a self inflicted gunshot wound, said Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nKevin Jordan, a resident who lives near the church, told CBS affiliate KENS-TV he witnessed the deadly shooting and saw a resident pursue the gunman. 'If it wasn't for him, the guy wouldn't have stopped,' he said.\n\nJordan described the resident who confronted the suspect as someone who would do anything for anyone. He said he watched the resident shoot at the suspect while taking cover behind a vehicle.\n\nVideo from KENS-TV showed first responders at the scene, located about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.\n\nCBS News\n\nAir Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement that Kelley is a former U.S. Air Force member who served from 2010 to 2014. Records confirm Kelley previously served in logistics readiness in New Mexico until his discharge in 2014, Stefanek said.\n\nKelley was court-martialed in 2012 for two counts of assault on his spouse and assault on their child, Stefanek said. He received a bad conduct discharge and confinement for 12 months.\n\nOfficials have not released all the names of the 26 people killed, but said they ranged from 18 months to 77 years old.\n\nAnnabelle Pomeroy, the 14-year-old daughter of the church's pastor, was one of the victim's killed in the shooting, her mother, Sherri Pomeroy, told CBS News via text message.\n\n'My husband and I were ironically out of town in two different states. We lost our 14-year-old daughter today and many friends,' Pomeroy said Sunday.\n\nShe added, 'Neither of us have made it back into town yet to personally see the devastation. I am at the Charlotte airport trying to get home as soon as I can.'\n\nAt least two other victims had been identified Monday morning, but there were still people whose condition and whereabouts were unclear.\n\nDana Fletcher, a business owner in the area, told CBS News she saw a 'ton' of sheriff's vehicles and ambulances racing down the road. She said she doesn't know what happened but said there was heavy police presence and people were being airlifted from the scene.\n\nSpecial agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said they were responding to the shooting.\n\nA law enforcement official said an FBI crisis response team is also at the scene assisting local police, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. She says officials are trying to determine a motive for the shooting.\n\nPresident Trump, who is on his first presidential trip to Asia, addressed the situation from Tokyo, calling it a 'horrific shooting' and an 'act of evil.'\n\n'Victims and their families were in their sacred place of worship. We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel,' Mr. Trump said in televised remarks. 'In dark times such as these, Americans do we what do best and we pull together. We lock hands and we joins arms. Through the tears and through the sadness we stand strong.'\n\nMr. Trump pledged his full support to the state of Texas and the local communities affected by Sunday's attack.\n\n'We offer our thanks to the first responders, to the FBI, all of the many people involved. I will continue to follow the developments closely. All of America is praying to God.'\n\nIn remarks early Monday morning, alongside his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, Mr. Trump said it appeared that 'mental health is the problem here. This was a very, based on preliminary reports, very deranged individual, a lot of problems over a long period of time.'\n\nIt was not clear what mental health issues Mr. Trump may have been referring to in the suspect's past, as law enforcement officials had yet to offer any insight into Kelley's suspected motive.\n\n'But, this isn't a guns situation, we could go into it, but it's a little soon to go into it,' added Mr. Trump, without further clarification.\n\nLate Sunday evening, around 100 people gathered near the church to remember the victims who were innocently gunned down earlier in the day.\n\nGov. Abbott attended the vigil and met with community members in the midst of the tragedy.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-church-shooting-devin-patrick-kelley-first-baptist-church-sutherland-springs-live-updates/","None"
"Putin on North Korea Crisis: Don't Back Kim Jong Un Into a Corner\nPutin did not mention the U.S. specifically on Thursday, but warned of the growing possibility of conflict and pointed out that North Korea is a 'sovereign country.'\n\n'Problems should be solved in dialogue, and North Korea should not be backed into a corner,' Putin said in a speech to the elite of Russia’s foreign policy establishment and foreign guests at a meeting organized by the Valdai Discussion Club near the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\nA series of missile and nuclear tests has rattled North Korea's neighbors. The U.S. has responded with sanctions.\n\nNorth Korea's foreign minister last month stated that Trump had 'declared war' on his country and that Kim's regime would consider shooting down American bombers. The White House later described the notion that the U.S. had declared war 'absurd.'\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits a footwear factory in a photo released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency on Thursday. KCNA / via Reuters\n\nNorth Korean officials last year also stated the country could seek to target the U.S. mainland if American nuclear forces mobilized against it.\n\nPyongyang has said in public statements that it wants an official end to the Korean War. The conflict was halted by a 1953 armistice but no peace treaty was ever signed. It also wants nothing short of full normalization of relations with the U.S. and to be treated with respect and as an equal in the global arena.\n\nWith the United States pulling back on the international stage, experts here suggested that Putin's Russia was displaying renewed confidence.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO / POOL / EPA\n\nAngela Stent, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University, highlighted that Russia has emerged as a strong actor in the Middle East, particularly since its 2015 military intervention in the conflict in Syria.\n\nStent said that under President Barack Obama, the U.S. had been 'pulling back from a more active role there, and I think Russia has certainly come in and filled a vacuum.”\n\n'Russia is the only great power in the Middle East that talks to both the Shiite and the Sunni countries, and also to Israel,' she added.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the U.S. has questioned international agreements such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.\n\nRussia in recent years has increased tensions with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 or the alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nSergey Kislyak, a former Russian ambassador to the United States, however, said he did not believe Moscow was seeking a larger role on the international stage.\n\nSergey Kislyak, right, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meets with President Donald Trump at the White House on May 10.

'We are a country, which is in its own right exceptional, which has its interests, which has ability and resolve to protect them, and we will do that.'\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, research director of the Foundation for Development and Support of the Valdai Discussion Club, said the Russian leadership sees the behavior of the U.S. as “totally unpredictable” at the moment because of domestic turmoil under the Trump administration.\n\n'There is a very clear understanding on the Russian side that the situation might go out of control much easier than before,” he said, citing the North Korea crisis as an example.\n\nSergey Karaganov, of the Russian Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, said the West no longer dominates militarily so other actors have the ability to step in.\n\n“Now there is an open competition,” he said, adding that Russia could use the opportunity to take on a stronger role, but in a limited way.\n\nRelated: Putin's Would-Be Successors Are Playing a Long Game\n\n“We're not going to be dominant — at most we will be a balancer and a security provider for the whole world,” Karaganov said, warning that it would be risky for Russia to get too involved.\n\nDomestic issues will become especially important for Putin in the coming months given that he is expected to run for re-election next March, while Russia is still recovering from an economic crisis.\n\nPutin has already spent almost 14 years as president — and boasts two other stints as the country's prime minister.\n\nAccording to pollsters, Russian voters are preoccupied with the economy, education, health insurance, pensions and social security.\n\nSuch results suggest the main challenge Putin must address before Russians head to the ballot box might not be overseas, but instead how to spur economic growth and accelerate development within the country.\n\nCarlo Angerer reported from Sochi, Russia.

"Palestinian teen activist could face years in prison after slapping an Israeli soldier\nHer wild, curly hair was unmistakeable, piled on top of her head, as she approached the two Israeli soldiers outside her house.\n\n'Come on, get out,' the teenage girl yelled last Friday afternoon at the soldiers. 'Get out of here, don't stay here.'\n\n2 #Palestinian girls asked an #Israeli officer & solider to get out from their home’s garden “ get out of here, get out of our home , do not stay here “ some pushing & kicking take place in the village of al Nabi Salah , Ramallah.

She went in again, this time with her right fist, hitting his shoulder. He deflected her.\n\n'Don't touch me,' she screamed in his face and reached up to slap the soldier. Five days after the incident, Ahed was led into an Israeli military court today.\n\nNOW: #AhedTamimi led by Israeli forces into Israeli military court after being arrested in her home in #Nabi Saleh #WestBank #FreeAhedTamimi pic.twitter.com/NfRwSc44dP — Activestills (@activestills) December 20, 2017\n\nThe dramatic video, shot and distributed by the Tamimi family, has gone viral in the past few days. Ahed is a well-known teenage activist, from a family of well-known activists in the Palestinian village of Nabi Saleh, in the occupied West Bank.\n\nPalestinians hail her as a brave young fighter and some pro-Israel blogs have dubbed her 'Shirley Temper.' Right-wing Israelis accuse her of using social media to distribute propaganda and discredit Israel. After the video garnered widespread media coverage in Israeli media Monday, overnight, the Israeli military arrested Ahed.\n\nThe morning after the arrest, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman threatened the family, saying, 'Everyone involved, not only the girl but also her parents and those around them, will not escape from what they deserve.'\n\nLieberman continued, “whoever goes wild during the day will be arrested at night. This is also an important message.'\n\nAhed was suspected of 'assaulting an IDF soldier and officer' and participating 'in a violent riot last Friday,” the Israeli army told ABC News in a statement.\n\nArmy officials said the only reason they were there was because 'rioters' had been throwing stones from the Tamimi house. The army stayed at the entrance to make sure no one else entered and that's when 'several Palestinians exited the house and began to violently provoke the soldiers.'\n\nThe soldier slapped by Ahed 'acted in a professional and restrained manner by not using force,' the army statement said. 'He could have arrested the Palestinians,' the statement said, and he didn't.\n\nThat was Friday afternoon. In the middle of the night Monday, her father described being woken up by the Israeli army.\n\n'They came at 3 a.m. in the morning,' her father, Bassem Tamimi, told ABC News. 'They were so aggressive. They arrested her and confiscated all the mobile phones and computers in the house,' including those belonging to her siblings, he says.\n\n'Ahed was not scared.'\n\nAhed has been a constant feature at protests in the village for years but it's the first time she has been detained by the Israeli military. Her detention has just been extended through Monday, according to her father. Even though she is a minor, she still goes to military court because she's in the West Bank, not in Israel.\n\n'Ahed is a symbol of her generation,' Tamimi told ABC News. 'She is a symbol of victory and not defeat.'\n\nNorthwest of the West Bank city of Ramallah, Nabih Saleh sits right next to Israeli settlement, Halamish. Palestinian villagers have been holding regular protests since 2009 against the expansion of Halamish. Going through checkpoints, and around the settlement, Tamimi said, is 'a very threatening environment' for his children.\n\nRamal Salah, a Palestinian psychologist who focuses on teenagers, said Palestinian teenagers, like in other conflict areas, 'are not your average teenagers' and pay a high psychological price for the daily exposure.\n\n'They see everything in the West Bank,' Salah said. 'They pass through the checkpoints, they see Israeli settlements, their land being confiscated and they see how Israeli soldiers humiliate their parents.'\n\nThey grow up angry, she added. Palestinians now see Ahed as a hero but that, Salah noted, puts any teenager under tremendous pressure.\n\nAhed's parents have both encouraged youth activism, and it's not the first time Ahed has gone viral.\n\nIn 2015, Ahed can be seen biting a soldier as he pins down her younger brother, then accused of throwing stones.\n\nIssam Rimawi/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nAnd in 2012, she can be seen raising her fist toward an Isreali soldier.\n\nQais/Abusamra/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nSpeaking to Army Radio Tuesday, Israel Education Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the extreme right-wing Jewish Home party, said Ahed and her cousin, the other girl seen in the video last Friday, 'should finish their lives in prison.'\n\n“The pictures are harsh,” Bennett said. “I trust that the incident will be investigated, the lessons will be learned, and those activists who attacked will be tried.”\n\nAhed could face seven years in prison, Bennett added.\n\nHer father, however, has different plans: 'I hope one day she will be able to be a leader of the Palestinian people.'\n\nABC News Nasser Atta reported from Jerusalem and Molly Hunter from London.","http://abcnews.go.com/International/palestinian-teen-activist-face-years-prison-slapping-israeli/story?id=51913049","None"
"How Kate Steinle's case became one of the biggest trials of the year\nFewer still had heard of Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old medical device sales representative living in San Francisco.\n\nBut those two topics have become closely linked since then. And the acquittal Thursday of an undocumented immigrant in her 2015 death became viral breaking news and set off a series of fiercely critical reactions from leading Republican voices across the US.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the verdict 'disgraceful.' Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the death was 'preventable' and said San Francisco's sanctuary city policies were to blame. Breitbart News for a time on Friday morning focused the top nine stories on its homepage to the verdict, and the hashtag #BoycottSanFrancisco became one of the top trending topics in the US on Twitter.\n\nWhy was there such a big reaction to this young woman's death? And how did a murder trial in California become one of the most important criminal cases of the year?\n\nSteinle's case broke through to larger awareness because it touched on several hot-button issues that have recently come to prominence.\n\nAnd that story largely begins -- as most in today's era do -- with Donald J. Trump.\n\n'For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed -- beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda,' Steinle's mother, Liz Sullivan, told the San Francisco Chronicle in September 2015 . 'We were the perfect storm for that man.'\n\nSan Francisco immigration policy\n\nProsecutors argued that Kate Steinle, left, was shot and killed by Jose Ines Garcia Zarate.\n\nOn July 1, 2015, Steinle was walking on a busy pier of the Embarcadero district in San Francisco when she was killed by a single bullet to the chest.\n\nThe man arrested, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 45, was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who had been deported from the US five times previously, according to officials.\n\nHe might have been deported a sixth time for a drug-related warrant, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested an immigration detainer and that the agency be notified before he was released.\n\nBut officials in San Francisco released Garcia Zarate from custody in April instead of turning him over to immigration authorities. San Francisco is a 'sanctuary city,' a term that broadly refers to a city that in some way does not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nAt the time, though, the term ' sanctuary city ' was not well known. A Google Trends query shows the phrase was rarely searched -- until a sharp spike in July 2015.\n\nTrump picks up the story\n\nTwo weeks earlier, Trump had launched his presidential campaign by criticizing US border security, saying that Mexico was sending criminals and 'rapists' to the US.\n\nThe comments faced harsh criticism from leaders across the political spectrum. Sen. Marco Rubio, his opponent in the Republican primary, said his comments were 'not just offensive and inaccurate, but also divisive.'\n\nSteinle's killing came two weeks later. Trump's first tweet about Steinle on July 3 was to offer his ' heartfelt condolences ' to her family. Less than an hour later, he directed his anger at Rubio.\n\n'.@MarcoRubio what do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can't secure our border? Stand up for US.'\n\n.@marcorubio what do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can't secure our border? Stand up for US — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2015\n\nIn a statement at the time, Trump said Steinle's shooting was further proof of the need for a border wall.\n\n'This senseless and totally preventable act of violence committed by an illegal immigrant is yet another example of why we must secure our border immediately,' Trump said in a statement. 'This is an absolutely disgraceful situation and I am the only one that can fix it. Nobody else has the guts to even talk about it.'\n\nTalk about it he did. Trump repeatedly brought up Steinle's case on the campaign trail. In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination , he said he was deeply affected by the stories of parents whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants.\n\n'My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities,' he said. 'But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?'\n\nOther Republicans legislators took his cue. This June, the House of Representatives passed 'Kate's Law,' a bill that would create harsher penalties for repeat illegal entry to the United States and would expand US law to pressure local cities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The bill has since stalled in the Senate.\n\nThe Steinle family's wishes\n\nGarcia Zarate listens in court during his trial in the killing of Kate Steinle.\n\nLost amid the heightened debate about the case's impact on immigration policy was, well, the evidence and arguments presented in court.\n\nProsecutors said Garcia Zarate intentionally and recklessly fired into a crowd on the San Francisco pier that day, killing Steinle. But his defense attorney said the shooting was accidental and emphasized evidence that the bullet ricocheted off the ground and traveled about 80 feet before hitting Steinle.\n\nOne of the defendant's lawyers said the debate over immigration didn't belong in the case.\n\n'From day one, this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,' public defender Francisco Ugarte said after the verdict.\n\nIn court, there was no mention of the defendant's immigration status, or his past criminal convictions, or San Francisco's immigration policy. Jurors were asked to decide the question: Was there evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooting was intentional?\n\nSimilarly, the widespread focus on Steinle's case often had little to do with the family's wishes.\n\n'Sensationalizing it is not the route we would like to go,' he said.

"Iranian cities hit by anti-government protests\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters take to streets venting anger against authorities\n\nAnti-government demonstrations that began in Iran on Thursday have now spread to several major cities.\n\nLarge numbers reportedly turned out in Rasht, in the north, and Kermanshah, in the west, with smaller protests in Isfahan, Hamadan and elsewhere.\n\nThe protests began against rising prices but have spiralled into a general outcry against clerical rule and government policies.\n\nA small number of people have been arrested in Tehran, the capital.\n\nThey were among a group of 50 people who gathered in a city square, Tehran's deputy governor-general for security affairs told the Iranian Labour News Agency.\n\nThe US State Department condemned the arrests and urged 'all nations to publicly support the Iranian people and their demands for basic rights and an end to corruption'.\n\nHow did the protests start?\n\nThe demonstrations began in the north-eastern city of Mashhad - the country's second most-populous - on Thursday.\n\nPeople there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested for chanting 'harsh slogans'.\n\nThe protests spread to other cities in the north-east, and and some developed into broader anti-government demonstrations, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings.\n\nOn Friday, despite warnings from authorities, the demonstrations spread further to some of the biggest cities in the country.\n\nThey represent the most serious and widespread expression of public discontent in Iran since mass protests in 2009 that followed a disputed election, correspondents say.\n\nWhat are people complaining about?\n\nWhat began as a protest against economic conditions and corruption has turned political.\n\nSlogans have been chanted against not just Mr Rouhani but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and clerical rule in general.\n\nDemonstrators were reportedly heard yelling slogans like 'The people are begging, the clerics act like God'. Protests have even been held in Qom, a holy city home to powerful clerics.\n\nThere is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted 'not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran', a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues.\n\nOther demonstrators chanted 'leave Syria, think about us' in videos posted online. Iran is a key provider of military support to the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n\nIt is also accused of providing arms to Houthi rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which it denies, and is an ally of Lebanon's powerful Shia movement Hezbollah.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption President Hassan Rouhani continues to be dogged by economic problems\n\nIran's Fars news agency, which is close to the elite and powerful Revolutionary Guards security force, reported that many protesters who turned out over economic grievances decided to leave rallies after others yelled political slogans.\n\nPresident Rouhani promised the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with world powers would boost the economy. However despite the lifting of international sanctions, the unemployment rate is 12.4%.\n\nHow big are the protests?\n\nThere have been calls on social media for protests up and down the country, despite warnings from the government against illegal gatherings.\n\nDemonstrations of varying sizes are reported to have occurred in at least seven cities.\n\nOverall, the numbers said to be taking part range from a less than 100 in some places to thousands in others - but demonstrations do not appear to be taking place on a massive scale.\n\nHow have the authorities reacted?\n\nVideos posted on social media appear to show clashes between security forces and some demonstrators in Kermanshah.\n\nFars news agency reported that protesters there destroyed some public property and were dispersed.\n\nThe governor-general of Tehran said that any such gatherings would be firmly dealt with by the police, who are out in force on main intersections.\n\nOfficials in Mashhad said the protest was organised by 'counter-revolutionary elements', and video online showed police using water cannon.\n\n'Seething discontent'\n\nAnalysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian\n\nThe demonstrations have taken the Iranian authorities by surprise. Impromptu anti-government demonstrations are rare in a country where the Revolutionary Guard and numerous intelligence agencies have a strong grip on the population.\n\nPredictably they are blaming anti-revolutionary elements and foreign agents. But the protests clearly stem from seething discontent in Iran, mainly because of the worsening economic conditions faced by ordinary Iranians.\n\nA BBC Persian investigation has found that Iranians, on average, have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years alone.\n\nMany believe that money that should be used to improve their lives is being spent by Iran's leaders on conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Billions are also being spent on spreading religious propaganda and Shia Islam around the world.\n\nBut it seems that the hardliners opposed to President Rouhani may have triggered the unrest by holding a demonstration that quickly grew out of control and spread to cities and towns across the country.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42512946","None"
"Gunman kills 4 in Calif. shooting spree; elementary students among wounded\nRANCHO TEHAMA, Calif. -- A gunman choosing targets at random opened fire in a rural Northern California town Tuesday, killing four people at several sites and wounding others at an elementary school before police shot him dead, authorities said. CBS affiliate KHSL-TV reports the suspect had a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns, and no motive has been declared.\n\n'This is a very tragic event for all of us. There are children involved. It's an emotional thing,' Tehama County Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said at a Tuesday evening press conference.\n\nAuthorities say one of the four victims killed was a neighbor he was accused of assaulting in January, the Associated Press reports. Officials have yet to identify the gunman.\n\nJohnston says the neighbor had a restraining order against the gunman. He says the neighbor was a woman but gave no other details.\n\nJohnston says the number of dead could go up because it's a rural area and there may be other victims.\n\nAP\n\nOfficials say the gunman was wearing a load bearing vest -- similar to what soldiers wear to carry their ammo.\n\nThe gunfire began shortly before 8 a.m. in the community of Rancho Tehama Reserve, about 130 miles north of Sacramento. Officials say the gunman crashed a pickup struck, stole another car and then started shooting. The area is a homeowners association of modest houses and trailers in rolling oak woodlands dotted with grazing cattle, AP reports.\n\nThree local hospitals have confirmed to CBS News they have received a total of 10 patients from the incident. It is not clear if patients were brought to other hospitals. Jeanine Quist, an administrative assistant with the Corning Union Elementary School District, says no one was killed at the Rancho Tehama Elementary School Monday morning but a 'number' of students were shot and wounded.\n\nAuthorities say a gunman tried to get into rooms at the elementary school, AP reports, with the intent of shooting children but that workers initiated a lockdown that saved lives. Surveillance video shows the gunman, but hasn't been released publicly.\n\nJohnson says school officials heard shots being fired and immediately locked down the school and that it was 'monumental' that school workers took the action they did and that it resulted in saving the lives of countless children.\n\nOfficials from the Rancho Tehama Elementary School say that the gunman crashed his vehicle through the school's locked gate and fired dozens of shots on the campus -- he shot out windows and through walls.\n\nThe school will be closed until further notice as an investigation continues and counselors will be available.\n\nAlthough police offered no immediate word on the assailant's motive, a sheriff's official said the shooter's neighbors had reported a domestic violence incident. About 100 law enforcement personnel are currently working at least seven crime scenes in the area, police said.\n\n'It was very clear at the onset that we had an individual that was randomly picking targets,' Johnston said.\n\nThe gunman's name is not being released, but CBS News has confirmed that he was fatally shot by two officers.\n\nJohnston, who according to KHSL-TV addressed reporters near one of the scenes, said deputies were first alerted to a shooting in Rancho Tehama Reserve before 'multiple victims and multiple shots' were reported at Rancho Tehama Elementary School. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots and children screaming at the school, about five miles down a road from where the shooting is believed to have started.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\n'I know that we have Medivaced a number of students,' Johnston said, referring to the use of helicopters for the emergency transport of victims to hospitals.\n\nAt least one student was wounded at the school. Another child was shot while driving with a woman, who also was wounded, Johnston said.\n\nJohnston said the school had been cleared by 10 a.m. and all other students have been brought to a safe location.\n\nGerardo Garcia works at a nearby convenience store and said it was like a war zone.\n\nSalvador Tello said the gunman fired at a truck in front of him as he was dropping off his three children. Tello said he was about three blocks from the school when bullets made 'big holes' in the truck in front of him.\n\nHe said he forced his children to duck down and slammed his truck into reverse and headed to the children's grandmother's house.\n\n'I put my kids down and put my truck in reverse and went out,' he said. 'I don't believe it because I wake up, take my kids, feed them cereal and put them in the truck and says 'Let's go to school like a normal day.''\n\nOn the way, he said, he saw an apparent gunshot victim and police at another scene.\n\nDetails were still sketchy hours after the shootings, and authorities did not have a firm count of the wounded due to the number of places the gunman attacked, Johnston said.\n\nBREAKING: At least 3 dead in shooting in Tehama Co. it started at a home and moved to the school.

It's not clear whether all three children were students at the elementary school.\n\nSt. Elizabeth Community Hospital in Red Bluff, California, received two victims. One is continuing to receive treatment at the hospital and the other was stabilized and transferred to another facility, according to Amanda Harter, the communications manager for Dignity Health North State. The company also operates Mercy Medical Center, which received three patients, one who was stabilized and transferred, and two others who are still undergoing treatment. It is not clear if any of the patients at St. Elizabeth or Mercy are children.\n\nBrian Flint told KHSL-TV that his roommate is among the victims and that his neighbor was the gunman. He said his neighbor, whom he knows only as Kevin, also stole his truck.\n\nHe said he and his roommate told authorities that their neighbor was acting 'crazy' and threatening them.\n\nFlint said the neighbor had been shooting 'hundreds of rounds' from large magazines.\n\nThe FBI confirmed to CBS News they are sending agents from Sacramento, Redding, and Chico to assist with the investigation.\n\nCalifornia Gov.

"1 dead, 19 injured after car plows into protesters in Charlottesville\nOne person was killed and 19 others were injured Saturday when a car plowed into a group of protesters in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, hours after police broke up violent confrontations ahead of a scheduled rally of white nationalists.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop after an accident that resulted in a death, Col. Martin Kumer, superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, told CBS News.\n\nThe FBI and the Department of Justice said Saturday night that they would be opening an investigation into the deadly crash. In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Session said 'violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice.'\n\n'The FBI has been supporting state and local authorities throughout the day,' Sessions said. 'U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has commenced a federal investigation and will have the full support of the Department of Justice. Justice will prevail.'\n\nThe deceased victim was a 32-year-old woman who was crossing the street, Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said Saturday night, adding that police are in the process of notifying the next of kin.\n\nFive of the injured were listed in critical condition -- the worst state -- and four others were in serious condition. Six were in fair condition, and four others were in good condition, authorities said Saturday.\n\nVideo of the incident showed a gray Dodge Charger plowing into counter-protesters who were marching through the city's shopping district. The force of the collision hurled several people into the air. Bystanders could be seen running in every direction while others stood by screaming for help.\n\nFootage from another angle showed the car speeding in reverse in an attempt to flee the scene.\n\nRyan M. Kelly/The Daily Progress via AP\n\nThose injured in the crash were transported to the University of Virginia (UVA) Medical Center, a hospital spokesperson told CBS News.\n\nA dozen medics were seen carting the injured back and forth on stretchers at the scene.\n\n'I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will -- go home,' Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said on Twitter.\n\nWhite nationalists clashed with police and counter-protesters hours before the collision in Charlottesville. Alt-right activists and white supremacists planned to protest the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from the city's Emancipation Park, but police broke up the demonstration before it began after fighting broke out.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty\n\nPresident Trump condemned the violence in remarks Saturday afternoon.\n\n'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides,' he said from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nMr. Trump said he spoke with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe over the phone and agreed 'that the hate and division must stop and it must stop right now.'\n\nHe added, 'What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order, and the protection of innocent lives.'\n\nBut Mr. Trump's comments drew the ire of some fellow Republicans.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colorado), leader of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2018, criticized Mr. Trump's speech and urged the president to 'call evil by its name.'\n\n'Mr. President -- we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism,' Gardner tweeted.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), also called on Mr. Trump to call the incident a 'terror attack by white supremacists.'\n\nLater, Mr. Trump tweeted his condolences to the victims. 'Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia,' he wrote.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty\n\nMcAuliffe had declared a state of emergency in the city early Saturday to aid the state's response to the violence.\n\n'I have a message to all the white supremacists and Nazis who came into Charlottesville today. Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot,' McAuliffe said Saturday night.\n\n'You came here today to hurt people and you did hurt people. My message is clear: we are stronger than you. You have made our commonwealth stronger. You will not succeed. There is no place for you here. There is no place for you in America,' McAuliffe added.\n\nJason Kessler, the organizer behind the 'Unite the Right' rally, said he plans to sue the city for violating a court order permitting the rally to be held in the park.\n\n'Our First Amendment rights were violated today,' Kessler said by phone before the car crash. He said the city of Charlottesville and McAuliffe violated the court ruling because they 'didn't like the outcome.'\n\nRyan M. Kelly, The Daily Progress\n\nSome protesters who came for the 'Unite the Right' rally were armed and dressed in military-like clothing, while others wore shirts with Nazi symbols and quotes from Adolf Hitler. Another read 'diversity is just a genocidal scam.'\n\nSaturday's confrontation came after a large group of torch-bearing white nationalists marched through the UVA campus Friday night, after a judge issued a ruling allowing Saturday's protest to move forward.\n\nUVA cancelled all scheduled events planned for Saturday citing 'ongoing public safety concerns,' but announced that the college's medical center would remain open.\n\n'The University is monitoring the developments in Charlottesville and continues to coordinate with state and local law enforcement,' the school said in a statement.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/1-dead-19-injured-after-car-plows-into-protesters-in-charlottesville/","None"
"New York truck attack: Trump backs Guantanamo for 'animal'\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump on New York terror suspect: 'Send him to Gitmo'\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he is open to sending the New York truck attack suspect to Guantanamo Bay.\n\n'I would certainly consider that,' he told reporters at a cabinet meeting.

The answer is, it's complicated.\n\nThe US government has cited the Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF), passed by Congress in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks, as justification for detaining enemy combatants at Guantanamo.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held this only applies to those captured who are part of Al Qaeda, the Taliban and 'associated forces'.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov?\n\nThe Obama administration interpreted this language to include individuals affiliated with the so-called Islamic State (IS), but that determination has not yet faced legal challenge.\n\nSo Mr Trump could move Saipov to Guantanamo, but the act would confront a number of legal challenges.\n\nIs Saipov - a permanent US resident captured on American soil who may have only been 'inspired' by IS - really an enemy combatant?\n\nIf so, is action against IS covered by the AUMF? It would be up to US judges to decide.\n\nTwo hawkish Republican senators - John McCain and Lindsey Graham - are advocating holding Mr Saipov as an 'enemy combatant'.\n\nThe suspect, who is not a US citizen, allegedly ploughed a rented truck into cyclists and pedestrians on a Manhattan bike path before he was shot by an officer and taken into custody.\n\nMr Trump told reporters: 'We also have to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now.\n\n'They'll go through court for years at the end, who knows what happens.'\n\nHe added: 'Because what we have right now is a joke and it's a laughing stock and no wonder so much of this stuff takes place.'\n\nGuantanamo Bay's population of inmates has dwindled from a high of more than 750 to 41.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's administration tried unsuccessfully to close the prison amid claims of abuse and a lack of due process.\n\nMr Trump has called repeatedly for 'extreme vetting' of travellers to the US, and has issued several executive orders blocking citizens from mainly-Muslim countries.\n\nThose executive orders have been blocked by the courts, and are due to be argued before the Supreme Court in the coming weeks.","http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41832934","None"
"Asteroid expected to make closest pass by Earth in over 40 years\nA large flying object expected in December has caught NASA's attention, but it isn't Santa Claus' sleigh.\n\nInstead, an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon is projected to come close enough to Earth that it's been classified as 'potentially hazardous' by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center.\n\nThe asteroid has a diameter of about 3 miles, according to NASA, making it the third-largest 'potentially hazardous' asteroid to pass by Earth.\n\nNASA expects Phaethon to be the closest to Earth on Dec. 16, when it's projected to be more than 6.4 million miles away. That's about 27 times the average distance between Earth and the moon, which is 238,855 miles.\n\nIt will be the closest this asteroid has been to Earth since Dec. 16, 1974, when it was just over 5 million miles away, according to NASA. But humans weren't aware of its presence until later; the asteroid was first discovered in 1983.\n\nIt's not expected to be this close to Earth again until 2093, when it's projected to pass more than 1.8 million miles away.\n\nWhile the 'potentially hazardous' classification may sound alarming, CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said there's really no reason to worry about this asteroid hitting Earth.\n\n'Any body that's bigger than about 500 feet across and its orbit carries it within about 4.6 million miles of Earth at any point in its orbit is classified as a 'potentially hazardous' object,' he explained. 'Meaning over millennia — lots and lots of time — gravitational interactions with the outer planets, you know, other objects in the solar system might perturb the orbit enough that it could actually impact the Earth.'\n\nHe continued, 'Now in the case of this asteroid, that's not the case. They think this asteroid — and its orbit is very well known — will never get closer than about 1.8 million miles of the Earth.'\n\nAstronomers are especially curious about Phaethon because it's believed to be the parent body for the Geminids meteor shower, which lights up the night skies in mid-December. Meteor showers are normally associated with comets, not asteroids, making Phaethon 'an unusual object,' NASA said. Some researchers believe it could be an inactive comet nucleus.\n\n'The 2017 apparition is the closest to Earth since the asteroid's discovery, so it may be possible for optical observers to detect new activity,' NASA said. The space agency is planning radar observations and said it hopes to obtain detailed images as the object zooms by. At its closest approach, Phaethon may be visible with a small telescope in dark skies.\n\n3200 Phaethon is named for a figure in Greek mythology. According to legend, Phaethon, son of the Sun god Helios, lost control of his father's chariot and nearly set the Earth on fire.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asteroid-expected-closest-pass-earth-40-years/","None"
"Inside the fight to take down online prostitution review boards\nAt first glance, the undercover video captured by a Seattle detective seems to show an ordinary guys' night out -- a bunch of men just hanging out at a local watering hole, eating nachos and drinking beers.\n\nBut police said these bar patrons were part of an exclusive group that called itself “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,” and they were meeting to talk about a very specific shared interest: their fondness for Korean prostitutes, who they referred to as “k-girls.”\n\n“She’s as close to perfect as I think they get made,” one man said, describing one of the Korean women.\n\n“Right after k-girls, I’ve always had this thing for Eastern Europeans,” another said. “Like Czech, Hungarian, anyone from a war-torn country. Anything with ‘will work for food.’”\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the detective sitting at their table during this series of meet-ups in 2015 was secretly videotaping their conversations as part of an undercover operation.\n\n“Everybody would sit down and order drinks, eat food, and talk about the latest prostitute that they have had sex with and trends that were going on,” the undercover detective told ABC News' “Nightline.” “There were some waitresses that seemed a little offended.”\n\nWatch the full story on ABC News 'Nightline' tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET\n\nThis unprecedented prostitution sting eventually blew the lid off a secretive network of online review boards – websites where users rate and recommend local prostitutes. King County District Attorney Valiant Richey described these sites as “Yelp for prostitution.”\n\nProstitution review websites are a prolific corner of the illicit online sex trade. Major websites, like TnA Review and The Erotic Review, cover nearly every city in the United States; each location has its own local customer reviews and often, escort ads. While these websites operate across the country, not all of these online communities agree to meet in person—something that made the Seattle case especially unique.\n\nThe investigation resulted in police raiding several brothels in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Bellevue, and the shutdown of three websites: “The Review Board” and its two Korean-centric offshoots, “The League” and “K-Girl Delights.” Something else unique about this case—the controversial felony charge leveled against several of the website users.\n\n“We have charged the people who were putting the content on the website with a felony charge of promoting prostitution,” Richey said.\n\n“Men go on, and they post reviews, and they share information,” he continued. “It goes beyond just a review and then on to a recommendation: ‘You have to go see this person, she's amazing. Go see her before she leaves.’”\n\nFelony charges for what many view as simply posting reviews on a website has never been attempted before in the United States. For Richey, it is part of his philosophy of focusing on the demand side of the prostitution industry, targeting the users instead of the suppliers.\n\n“Most people in prostitution are exploited and so criminalizing them doesn't make a lot of sense from a moral perspective, it also just doesn't work from a criminal justice perspective,” Richey said. “At the same time, we understand … the exploitation that is driven through sex buying, is caused by the buyer. And so the buyer needs to be held accountable.”\n\nSome of the review site users caught in this sting were prominent tech executives, including an Amazon software developer and a high-level Microsoft director. Richey said that many of the men he charged were high-level users, and were “spending anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 a year on this.”\n\nCritics of Richey’s demand-side prosecution philosophy have accused him of using his office to make headlines, a charge he fully denies.\n\n“The main focus for us is on dismantling these networks of buyers who are creating this vociferous demand for exploited women,” he said.\n\nAll of the men charged in this case declined requests for on-the-record interviews. In addition to the website shutdowns, several Korean brothels in Bellevue were raided. Police say they found 12 women of Korean descent inside, who they released without charges. In a police press conference, the women were described as 'trafficked.' While “Nightline” was unable to track down any of these women, a man who owned two of these brothels agreed to tell his side of the story.\n\nMichael Durnal served 45 days in prison after his Bellevue brothels were raided by police. He said he first became involved in the Korean prostitution world as a client. Then he fell in love with one of the women. The woman was in debt back in Korea, he was told, so Durnal decided to leave his family and his job to open up a brothel with her to make money.\n\nDurnal said his reason for picking Bellevue was simple: “Bellevue's big money.” He ended up opening two brothels there, and said his job was to book clients for the women working in his locations. But Durnal said that as time went on, he began to get to know the women and learn more about why they were selling sex.\n\n“Some of them just want to start a business,” he said. “Some of them, their families will get hurt or, you know, death … One girl actually in particular told me that. I asked her why she doesn't just run and she said she tried, and they find them.”\n\nDurnal repeatedly said he regrets getting involved in prostitution because he said he saw firsthand the damage it could do. “You feel like the piece of the soul from the girl is gone,” he said.\n\nWhile he said he never personally used “The Review Board” or any similar website, he said many of his clients did.\n\n“I would ask my clients, ‘If you liked her, review her,’ you know?” he said.\n\nYet Durnal questions the police’s claim that they “rescued” the Korean women in the brothels.\n\n“They said that, ‘People were holding them captive.’ This came out of law enforcement's mouth,” he said. “And who did they save? Every girl they let go? Every girl's back in the business. They just go someplace else.”\n\n“They're moving on their own, they’re not being held captive in what one would think of as being held captive,” Durnal continued. “Nobody is holding their passports.”\n\nBrad Myles of the anti-trafficking group Polaris said debt bondage is a common factor when it comes to Korean women working out of brothels in the United States.\n\n“Debt bondage is different from debt,” Myles said. “It’s a particular kind of predatory manipulative debt, where fees and interest rates and other hidden costs and all these things kick into gear, so … the debt grows faster than the person can pay it off.'\n\nHe went on, 'You’ve got women being recruited from South Korea, usually told lies about what they’re going to be doing here in the United Sates, usually held in some kind of debt. And then you have these customers that are coming and buying sex from these women who think that the women are there voluntarily. But the customers don’t understand the full picture.”\n\nThe “Nightline” team met one Seattle-based sex worker, Maggie McNeill, who criticized the shutdown of the review websites, saying they provided a valuable vetting tool for her in booking clients.\n\n“You have [a] reputation,” she said. “To use an example, right, eBay … if somebody's got 98 percent positive reviews on eBay as a buyer or as a seller, that lets you have confidence in dealing with that person.”\n\nMcNeill, who also runs a popular sex work blog, said that she believes the shutdown of these boards interferes with free speech, and to shut them down is a disservice both to sex workers and to those exercising their right to free association online.\n\nBut Alisa Bernard, who calls herself a prostitution survivor turned activist, said she believes review sites don’t make things safer for sex workers. She used to work through “The Review Board” in the Seattle area.\n\n“There's a perception of safety because there's this, ‘Oh, well, you have to go through this board, and it's online, and look how clean it is,’” Bernard said. “I had been raped multiple times. I was held against my will at least once. I was strangled, and these were all by Review Board guys so, you know, again, your line keeps getting pushed further and further and further to get those good reviews.”\n\nBernard explained that a bad review could have a huge impact on business, giving the clients too much power.\n\n“Women within prostitution experience rates of PTSD twice that of war veterans,” she said, citing a 1988 study by Dr. Melissa Farley, a psychologist and researcher at the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco. “This is the reality for us.”\n\nWhile the controversy over review websites will continue, District Attorney Valiant Richey said he is working to eliminate sex buying altogether, calling prostitution “the oldest oppression.” He travels across the country, telling other prosecutors about demand-side prostitution prosecution and encouraging them to take on similar cases.\n\n“The one way we can try to eliminate it is by helping men realize that this isn't serving them either,” he said. “In a survey of sex buyers, three-quarters of buyers said they wanted to stop.

"FCC's Pai: 'Heavy-Handed' Net Neutrality Rules Are Stifling The Internet\nFCC's Pai: 'Heavy-Handed' Net Neutrality Rules Are Stifling The Internet\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission chairman announced plans Tuesday to repeal Obama-era regulations on Internet service providers. The 2015 rules enforce what's called net neutrality, meaning that the companies that connect you to the Internet don't get to decide which websites load faster or slower, or charge websites or apps to load faster.\n\nIn an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan to remove net neutrality rules is a way of bringing the Internet back to how it was in the 1990s.\n\n'President Clinton got it right in 1996 when he established a free market-based approach to this new thing called the Internet, and the Internet economy we have is a result of his light-touch regulatory vision,' Pai says. 'We saw companies like Facebook and Amazon and Google become global powerhouses precisely because we had light-touch rules that apply to this Internet. And the Internet wasn't broken in 2015 when these heavy-handed regulations were adopted.'\n\nPai's plan would require Internet service providers to disclose what they're doing, such as allowing some sites to load faster than others. Websites could pay ISPs to give them preferential treatment — a situation Pai argues would have benefits.\n\nA health care startup could pay to prioritize the traffic of its patients who are being monitored remotely: 'That could be perk,' he says.\n\nThe chairman's proposal, called the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, would mark a shift in authority and emphasis. Instead of the FCC regulating how ISPs operate, the Federal Trade Commission would handle enforcement of net neutrality violations.\n\n'The FCC would still require transparency: Any business practice that would affect the offering of a service has to be disclosed to the consumers, and entrepreneurs can understand exactly how these businesses are operated,' Pai says.\n\n'Secondly, the Federal Trade Commission has long had authority and had authority prior to 2015 for almost 20 years over this space,' he says. 'And the result was pretty clear. They took targeted action against the bad apples and they let everyone else thrive in a free market. And I think consumers and companies were better off as a result.'\n\nAs NPR's Alina Selyukh explained earlier this year, the current rules arose from incidents of ISPs meddling with traffic speeds:\n\n'In 2015, the Democrats of the FCC decided that it was time to go all in, and what they did was essentially reclassified Internet providers, and started treating them as utility-style companies. That means they put it in the strictest-ever regulations, really expanded their oversight over the industry. Republicans at the FCC at the time really opposed this regulatory approach, so-called public utility approach. And one of the dissenting commissioners was Ajit Pai, who is now the new FCC chairman under President Trump.'\n\nMany were critical of Pai's announcement and vowed to fight it.\n\n'If the FCC votes to roll back these net neutrality protections, they would end the internet as we know it, harming every day users and small businesses, eroding free speech, competition, innovation and user choice in the process,' said Mozilla, the nonprofit corporation that makes the Firefox browser and advocates for Internet accessibility. 'Our position is clear: the end of net neutrality would only benefit Internet Service Providers.'\n\n'It is imperative that all internet traffic be treated equally, without discrimination against content or type of traffic — that's the how the internet was built and what has made it one of the greatest inventions of all time,' the company added.\n\nThe ACLU also issued a statement opposing Pai's plan.\n\n'In a world without net neutrality, activists may lose an essential platform to organize and fight for change, and small organizations may never get a fair shot to grow and thrive,' said Ronald Newman, ACLU director of strategic initiatives. 'Congress must stop Chairman Pai's plan in its tracks and ensure that net neutrality remains the law of the land.'\n\nEditor's Note: NPR's legal counsel has filed comments with the FCC on behalf of the public radio system, opposing the repeal of the 2015 net neutrality rules.

"Trump Inherits a Secret Cyberwar Against North Korean Missiles\n“Disrupting their tests,” William J. Perry, secretary of defense in the Clinton administration, said at a recent presentation in Washington, would be “a pretty effective way of stopping their ICBM program.”\n\nDecades in the Making\n\nThree generations of the Kim family have dreamed that their broken, otherwise failed nation could build its own nuclear weapons, and the missiles to deliver them, as the ultimate survival strategy. With nukes in hand, the Kims have calculated, they need not fear being overrun by South Korea, invaded by the United States or sold out by China.\n\nNorth Korea began seeking an intercontinental ballistic missile decades ago: It was the dream of Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder, who bitterly remembered the American threats to use nuclear weapons against the North during the Korean War.\n\nHis break came after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when out-of-work Russian rocket scientists began seeking employment in North Korea. Soon, a new generation of North Korean missiles began to appear, all knockoffs of Soviet designs. Though flight tests were sparse, American experts marveled at how the North seemed to avoid the kinds of failures that typically strike new rocket programs, including those of the United States in the late 1950s.\n\nThe Rise of Missile and Nuclear Tests The frequency of missile tests has risen dramatically under Kim Jong-un, with a recent increase in nuclear tests as well. 25 20 Nuclear test 15 Missile test 10 5 0 ’01 ’06 ’09 ’11 ’13 ’16 ’17 Kim Jong-un Kim Jong-il 1994–2011 2011– The Rise of Missile and Nuclear Tests The frequency of missile tests has risen dramatically under Kim Jong-un, with a recent increase in nuclear tests as well. 25 20 Nuclear test 15 Missile test 10 5 0 ’01 ’06 ’09 ’11 ’13 ’17 Kim Jong-un Kim Jong-il 1994–2011 2011–\n\nThe success was so marked that Timothy McCarthy of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey wrote in a 2001 analysis that Pyongyang’s record “appears completely unique in the history of missile development and production.”\n\nIn response, President George W. Bush in late 2002 announced the deployment of antimissile interceptors in Alaska and California. At the same time, Mr. Bush accelerated programs to get inside the long supply chain of parts for North Korean missiles, lacing them with defects and weaknesses, a technique also used for years against Iran.\n\nThreat Grows in Obama Era\n\nBy the time Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, the North had deployed hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles that used Russian designs, and had made billions of dollars selling its Scud missiles to Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. But it aspired to a new generation of missiles that could fire warheads over much longer distances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn secret cables written in the first year of the Obama administration, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out the emerging threat. Among the most alarming released by WikiLeaks, the cables described a new path the North was taking to reach its long-range goal, based on a missile designed by the Soviets decades ago for their submarines that carried thermonuclear warheads.\n\nIt was called the R-27. Unlike the North’s lumbering, older rockets and missiles, these would be small enough to hide in caves and move into position by truck. The advantage was clear: This missile would be far harder for the United States to find and destroy.\n\nThe North Korean Arsenal The rockets currently being tested have a wide range of sizes and capabilities. No flight tests to date 6ft Scud B/C/ER KN-11 Nodong Musudan KN-14 KN-08 600 7,200 180–600 miles 800 2,200 6,200 Primary engines believed to be based on Soviet R-27 missile system The North Korean Arsenal The rockets currently being tested have a wide range of sizes and capabilities.

And that February, the North set off a nuclear test that woke up Washington: The monitoring data told of an explosion roughly the size of the bomb that had leveled Hiroshima.\n\nDays after the explosion, the Pentagon announced an expansion of its force of antimissile interceptors in California and Alaska. It also began to unveil its “left of launch” program to disable missiles before liftoff — hoping to bolster its chances of destroying them. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced the program, saying that “cyberwarfare, directed energy and electronic attack,” a reference to such things as malware, lasers and signal jamming, were all becoming important new adjuncts to the traditional ways of deflecting enemy strikes.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe never mentioned North Korea. But a map accompanying General Dempsey’s policy paper on the subject showed one of the North’s missiles streaking toward the United States. Soon, in testimony before Congress and at public panels in Washington, current and former officials and a major contractor — Raytheon — began talking openly about “left of launch” technologies, in particular cyber and electronic strikes at the moment of launch.\n\nThe North, meanwhile, was developing its own exotic arsenal. It tried repeatedly to disrupt American and South Korean military exercises by jamming electronic signals for guided weapons, including missiles. And it demonstrated its cyberpower in the oddest of places — Hollywood. In 2014, it attacked Sony Pictures Entertainment with a strike that destroyed about 70 percent of the company’s computing systems, surprising experts with its technical savvy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast month, a report on cybervulnerabilities by the Defense Science Board, commissioned by the Pentagon during the Obama administration, warned that North Korea might acquire the ability to cripple the American power grid, and cautioned that it could never be allowed to “hold vital U.S. strike systems at risk.”\n\nSecret Push, and New Doubts\n\nNot long after General Dempsey made his public announcement, Mr. Obama and his defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, began calling meetings focused on one question: Could a crash program slow the North’s march toward an intercontinental ballistic missile?\n\nThere were many options, some drawn from General Dempsey’s list. Mr. Obama ultimately pressed the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to pull out all the stops, which officials took as encouragement to reach for untested technologies.\n\nThe North’s missiles soon began to fail at a remarkable pace. Some were destroyed, no doubt, by accident as well as by design. The technology the North was pursuing, using new designs and new engines, involved multistage rockets, introducing all kinds of possibilities for catastrophic mistakes. But by most accounts, the United States program accentuated the failures.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe evidence was in the numbers. Most flight tests of an intermediate-range missile called the Musudan, the weapon that the North Koreans showed off in public just after Mrs. Clinton’s warning, ended in flames: Its overall failure rate is 88 percent.\n\nNonetheless Kim Jong-un has pressed ahead on his main goal: an intercontinental ballistic missile. Last April, he was photographed standing next to a giant test-stand, celebrating after engineers successfully fired off a matched pair of the potent Russian-designed R-27 engines. The implication was clear: Strapping two of the engines together at the base of a missile was the secret to building an ICBM that could ultimately hurl warheads at the United States.\n\nIn September, he celebrated the most successful test yet of a North Korean nuclear weapon — one that exploded with more than twice the destructive force of the Hiroshima bomb.\n\nHis next goal, experts say, is to combine those two technologies, shrinking his nuclear warheads to a size that can fit on an intercontinental missile. Only then can he credibly claim that his isolated country has the know-how to hit an American city thousands of miles away.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the last year of his presidency, Mr. Obama often noted publicly that the North was learning from every nuclear and missile test — even the failures — and getting closer to its goal. In private, aides noticed he was increasingly disturbed by North Korea’s progress.\n\nWith only a few months left in office, he pushed aides for new approaches. At one meeting, he declared that he would have targeted the North Korean leadership and weapons sites if he thought it would work. But it was, as Mr. Obama and his assembled aides knew, an empty threat: Getting timely intelligence on the location of North Korea’s leaders or their weapons at any moment would be almost impossible, and the risks of missing were tremendous, including renewed war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nHard Decisions for Trump","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-program-sabotage.html","1488603600.0"
"LAPD clarifies it cannot confirm Tom Petty's death\nUPDATE: Tom Petty's longtime manager announced Monday night that the rocker has died at age 66. Petty was surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends, according to a statement.\n\nTom Petty, the rocker best known as the frontman of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, is clinging to life in a Los Angeles hospital, according to TMZ. An earlier report which confirmed the singer's death, and which CBS reported, has since been clarified. CBS News reported information obtained officially from the LAPD about Tom Petty. The LAPD later said it was not in a position to confirm information about the singer and that 'initial information was inadvertently provided to some media sources.' In that statement, the LAPD also apologized for 'any inconvenience in this reporting.'\n\n(1/2)The LAPD has no information about the passing of singer Tom Petty. Initial information was inadvertantly provided to some media sources — LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) October 2, 2017\n\n(2/2) However, the LAPD has no investigative role in this matter. We apologize for any inconvenience in this reporting. — LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) October 2, 2017\n\nThe legendary musician suffered a full cardiac arrest and was found unconscious and not breathing in his Malibu home Sunday night. He was taken to UCLA Santa Monica Hospital and put on life support, reports TMZ.\n\nPetty rose to fame in the 1970s with his band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The group put out several hits, including 'American Girl,' 'Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,' 'Breakdown,' 'Listen to Her Heart' and more. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Petty was also a successful solo artist and sang the megahit 'Freefallin'.'\n\nThough Petty and his band debuted their first self-titled record in 1976, they continued to perform over the past four decades. Petty played his last show last Monday, performing three sold-out shows at the Hollywood Bowl to conclude their 40th anniversary tour. The band wrote on their website that the tour included 53 shows in 24 states.\n\nIn December, Petty told Rolling Stone that he thought this would be the group's last tour together. He said, 'It's very likely we'll keep playing, but will we take on 50 shows in one tour? I don't think so. I'd be lying if I didn't say I was thinking this might be the last big one. We're all on the backside of our sixties. I have a granddaughter now I'd like to see as much as I can. I don't want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that's a lot of time.'\n\nPetty, who released three solo albums and 13 albums with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, also took part in the 1980s supergroup the Traveling Wilburys with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne. He told Rolling Stone he was hoping to release a deluxe version of his 1994 solo album 'Wildflowers' with a bonus disc of unreleased material. He had also hoped to play a special 'Wildflowers' tour.\n\nThe rocker kept his hands full with his SiriusXM channel, Tom Petty Radio, as well. He personally oversaw the station and had his own interview show called 'Tom Talks to Cool People' where he interviewed musicians like Micky Dolenz of the Monkees and former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham.\n\nPetty was born and raised in Gainesville, Florida. He said he wanted to become a musician when he was 13 and saw The Beatles play on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' He told Grammy.com, 'This was the great moment in my life, really, that changed everything. I had been a fan up to that point. But this was the thing that made me want to play music.' He added, 'It did have a great profound effect on my life, and I thank them for that. I still think the Beatles [made] the best music ever, and I'm sure I'll go to my grave thinking the same thing.'\n\nPetty showed the guitar he wrote 20 years of songs on to Anthony Mason on 'CBS This Morning' in 2009.

"U.S. Abortion Rate Falls To Lowest Level Since Roe v. Wade\nU.S. Abortion Rate Falls To Lowest Level Since Roe v. Wade\n\nThe abortion rate in the United States fell to its lowest level since the historic Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalized abortion nationwide, a new report finds.\n\nThe report by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports legalized abortion, puts the rate at 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age (ages 15-44) in 2014. That's the lowest recorded rate since the Roe decision in 1973. The abortion rate has been declining for decades — down from a peak of 29.3 in 1980 and 1981.\n\nThe report also finds that in 2013, the total number of abortions nationwide fell below 1 million for the first time since the mid-1970s. In 2014 — the most recent year with data available — the number fell a bit more, to 926,200. The overall number had peaked at more than 1.6 million abortions in 1990, according to Guttmacher.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, given the longstanding controversy around abortion policy, the meaning of the report is somewhat in dispute.\n\nPlanned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said efforts to help women get better access to contraception are paying off. She points in particular to recent improvements in the rate of unintended pregnancies, and a historically low teen pregnancy rate.\n\n'It shows that we're finally doing a better job of helping women get access to birth control that's affordable and that's high-quality,' Richards said.\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, Richards is gearing up for a fight over federal funding for women's health services provided by Planned Parenthood. Republican leaders in Congress have vowed to work with Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which requires contraceptive coverage for many women.\n\n'We shouldn't go backwards on access to birth control,' Richards said.\n\nSome anti-abortion groups, meanwhile, argue the Guttmacher report shows new state restrictions on abortion are working. Kristi Hamrick, a spokeswoman for Americans United for Life, said she has her doubts about the Guttmacher report — since the data come from surveys of abortion providers — but accepts the overall conclusion. She emphasized the impact of new regulations on clinics and laws requiring women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound, which she said are having a 'real, measurable impact on abortion.'\n\n'These have been game-changers, and we see the abortion rate dropping in response,' Hamrick said.\n\nHamrick said she believes abortion numbers are also falling in part because public sentiment is turning against abortion — although surveys by the Pew Research Center show opinions on abortion have been largely stable over the past two decades. The Gallup polling firm has found Americans largely divided on abortion in recent decades, with a majority labeling themselves 'pro-choice' in a 2015 survey.\n\nThe Guttmacher report says abortion restrictions do appear to be a factor in the declining numbers in some states. But principal research scientist Rachel Jones, lead author of the report, said that's not the whole story. She noted that abortion declined in almost every state, and 'having fewer clinics didn't always translate into having fewer abortions.'\n\nA more important driver of the declining abortion rate, Jones said, appears to be improved access to contraception, particularly long-acting birth control options like IUDs. She noted that women in the United States have been using the highly effective devices in growing numbers for more than a decade, and said the declining birthrate suggests more women are preventing unwanted pregnancies.\n\n'Abortion is going down, and births aren't going up,' Jones said.\n\nChuck Donovan, president of the anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute, called the drop in the abortion rate 'good news,' regardless of one's political point of view. He said there are likely a number of factors behind the decline.\n\n'By and large, this is encouraging for a country that obviously remains deeply divided and discomfited about the benefits of abortion to the public,' Donovan said.\n\nBut when it comes to abortion, common ground is hard to find. The Guttmacher Institute's Jones said the data may signal that some women who want abortions can't get access.\n\n'If there are women in these highly restrictive states who want abortions but can't get them because there aren't any clinics that they can get to, and that's why abortion's going down, that's not a good thing,' Jones said. 'But we think the story that's going on in a lot of situations, in a lot of states, is that fewer women are having unintended pregnancies and in turn fewer abortions, and that is actually a good story.'","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/17/509734620/u-s-abortion-rate-falls-to-lowest-level-since-roe-v-wade","1484629200.0"

"Spain and the Catalan referendum | Letters\nA group of MPs and peers writes to denounce Spain’s attempts to block the referendum in Catalonia. And more than a hundred academics put their names to a letter condemning Madrid’s crackdown\n\nWe, the undersigned peers and MPs, have a range of opinions on whether Catalonia should be independent or remain part of Spain (Report, 21 September). However, we all agree that the issue should be decided by the people of Catalonia in a democratic and peaceful way. We are extremely disturbed by the measures taken by the Spanish government to prevent the referendum, agreed to by the Catalan parliament, taking place on 1 October.\n\nThese measures include: taking to court 700 Catalan mayors for allowing preparations for the vote to go ahead, seizing campaign material and ballot papers, threatening to cut off power to polling stations, arresting and charging a newspaper editor accused of aiding the preparations for the referendum and banning a public meeting called in Madrid to discuss the issue. The Spanish government has now sent in the Civil Guard to occupy government buildings, with ministers and officials arrested, and has taken control of the Catalan government’s finances.\n\nBoth King Felipe and the prime minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, have publicly called on Catalans not to vote.\n\nWe believe, however, that the democratic way to proceed would be for opponents of Catalan independence to campaign for their position in the referendum. That was the stance of the UK government in respect of the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014.\n\nThis referendum was democratically agreed to by the Catalan parliament. To attempt to impede or stop it through sanctions, criminal charges and direct action by the Spanish state is an affront to democracy and threatens to embitter relations between Catalonia and the rest of Spain.

Section 155 of the Spanish constitution states that the government can only compel an autonomous community (state or regional government) to carry out legal actions with the prior consent of a majority of the Spanish senate. No such vote has taken place.\n\nWe are concerned that the level of political repression in Catalonia is of a severity and arbitrary character not experienced since the Franco dictatorship.

"James O’Keefe tweeted about his ‘confrontation’ with a Post reporter. Here’s what really happened.\nThe Washington Post on Monday published a report about a woman who falsely claimed Roy Moore sexually assaulted her as a teenager — and who appeared to work with Project Veritas, an organization that uses deceptive tactics and secretly recorded conversations in an effort to embarrass its targets.\n\nShortly after the investigation was published, Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe tweeted a video of what he called his “confrontation” with one of the authors of The Post investigation, Aaron C. Davis. The video was heavily edited, a tactic for which Project Veritas has drawn criticism.\n\nThe Post filmed the entire encounter.\n\nDavis and another Post reporter, along with two video reporters, went to the Project Veritas offices in Mamaroneck, N.Y., on Monday morning to try to determine whether the woman, Jaime T. Phillips, worked there. They watched as she walked into the office. O’Keefe, who appeared minutes later, declined to answer questions. He invited Davis back for an interview shortly after noon.\n\nIn the full version of the video, O’Keefe repeatedly declined to answer questions about the woman and her affiliation with Project Veritas. The organization has previously targeted mainstream media outlets such as CNN, which it accuses of being biased.\n\nUpon tweeting the edited version of the video, O’Keefe said, “The Washington Post sends a reporter to question me, but take a look. Who’s interviewing who?”\n\n[Analysis: A botched sting with a phony Roy Moore ‘accuser’ was supposed to discredit the media.

O’Keefe tweeted that the conversation exposes the newspaper’s “hidden agenda” and alleged bias against President Trump.\n\n“Is The Washington Post ambushing me and confronting us because of what we’re about to release? Is this a sort of anticipatory behavior ahead of what we’re about to do?” O’Keefe asked Davis in the video.\n\n“For several weeks you have had one of your employees, contacting our reporters, under a false name, having multiple interviews,” Davis responded. “We have been trying to test the veracity . . . of the folks coming forward, accusing Roy Moore.”\n\nIn a series of interviews with Post reporters over two weeks, Phillips shared a false story about an alleged sexual relationship in 1992 with Moore, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama. She said the relationship led to an abortion when she was 15. During the interviews, she repeatedly pressed Post reporters to give their opinions on the whether her claims could affect Moore’s candidacy if she went public.\n\nThe Post did not publish an article based on her unsubstantiated account. When Post reporters confronted her last Wednesday with inconsistencies in her story, as well as an Internet posting that raised doubts about her motivations, she insisted that she was not working with any organization that targets journalists.\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman approached The Post with dramatic — and false — tale about Roy Moore.

"British banks handled vast sums of laundered Russian money\nExclusive: Billions of dollars were moved out of Russia in ‘Global Laundromat’ operation, with anonymously owned UK companies playing major role\n\nBritain’s high street banks processed nearly $740m from a vast money-laundering operation run by Russian criminals with links to the Russian government and the KGB, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nHSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts are among 17 banks based in the UK, or with branches here, that are facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers.\n\nThe Global Laundromat: how did it work and who benefited? Read more\n\nDocuments seen by the Guardian show that at least $20bn appears to have been moved out of Russia during a four-year period between 2010 and 2014. The true figure could be $80bn, detectives believe.\n\n\n\nOne senior figure involved in the inquiry said the money from Russia was “obviously either stolen or with criminal origin”.\n\nInvestigators are still trying to identify some of the wealthy and politically influential Russians behind the operation, known as “the Global Laundromat”.\n\n\n\nThey estimate a group of about 500 people were involved. These include oligarchs, Moscow bankers, and figures working for or connected to the FSB, the successor spy agency to the KGB.\n\nIgor Putin, the cousin of Russia’s president, Vladimir, sat on the board of a Moscow bank which held accounts involved in the fraud.\n\n\n\nBritish-registered companies played a prominent role in this extensive money-laundering network. The real owners of most of the firms used in the scheme remain secret, however, because of the anonymity provided by controversial offshore laws.\n\nThe Global Laundromat banking records were obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Novaya Gazeta from sources who wish to remain anonymous. OCCRP shared the data with the Guardian and media partners in 32 countries.\n\n\n\nThe documents include details of about 70,000 banking transactions, including 1,920 that went through UK banks and 373 via US banks.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest HSBC’s building in Canary Wharf, London. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA Archive/Press Association Ima\n\nThe data is understood to be part of the evidence gathered in a three-year money-laundering investigation led by police in Latvia and Moldova.\n\nDetectives have unravelled a conspiracy that involved billions of dollars being sent from suspected criminals in Russia via accounts in Latvia and Moldova held at banks notorious for their exposure to money-laundering scams.\n\nRussian money and the 'Global Laundromat': what UK banks said Read more\n\nThe trail led investigators to 96 countries and to a network of anonymously owned firms, most of them registered at Companies House in London. Most of the 21 core companies under scrutiny have been dissolved.\n\nThe scale of the operation has staggered law enforcement officials. The records show British banks and foreign banks with offices in London processed $738.1m in transactions apparently involving criminal money from Moscow.\n\nBanks say they have sophisticated units dedicated to rooting out financial crime. But they say the volume of payments – billions a year – makes such work difficult.\n\n“If you are on the back end you are kind of playing whack-a-mole, trying to pick this up,” one source said.\n\nHSBC processed $545.3m in Laundromat cash, mostly routed through its Hong Kong branch. The troubled Royal Bank of Scotland – which is 71% owned by the UK government – handled $113.1m. Coutts – used by the Queen and owned by RBS – accepted $32.8m worth of payments via its office in Zurich, Switzerland. Coutts is winding down its Swiss operation and was last month fined by regulators for money laundering in a different case.\n\nOther high street banks that appear in the Laundromat data include Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds. NatWest – also owned by RBS – allowed through $1.1m.\n\nIn the US, big banks processed more than $63.7m. They include Citibank ($37m) and Bank of America ($14m).\n\nThe Guardian contacted all these banks. None of them challenged the authenticity of the data, but they all insisted they had strict anti-money-laundering policies.\n\nThe response from RBS was typical. The bank said: “We are committed to combatting financial crime and money laundering in line with our regulations and have controls and safeguards in place to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate these risks.” The statement covered Coutts and NatWest.\n\n\n\nHSBC said: “This case highlights the need for greater information sharing between the public and private sectors, each of whom holds important information the other does not.”\n\nHowever, the Guardian’s disclosures raise awkward questions for UK banks. The Financial Conduct Authority demands that banks “consider the money-laundering risk presented by customers, taking into account country risk; the customer’s reputation and the source of their wealth and funds”.\n\nIn many of the cases looked at by the Guardian, money vanished into offshore shell firms, whose “beneficial owners” remain anonymous, and whose source of wealth is a mystery. The OCCRP discovered that the official owners of many of the firms were fake or “nominee” directors based in Ukraine.\n\nHow 'dirty money' from Russia flooded into the UK – and where it went Read more\n\nThe Guardian showed details of the transfers to L Burke Files, an international financial investigator. He said compliance checks at many western banks were desultory, and often little more than “box ticking”.\n\n“Typically the compliance and investigations department is treated like an unwanted step-child. The directors of a bank see compliance as an expense without any return. The compliance professionals are underpaid, underskilled and receive little or no effective training in spotting criminal patterns.”\n\nFiles added: “Most of the transactions I’m seeing here would have required substantial enhanced due diligence. It isn’t just individual transactions. It’s the repeated pattern.”\n\nPolice in eastern Europe have focused on a number of British shell companies, including Seabon Limited, which was run by a company management firm in Tooley Street, London, just around the corner from the mayor of London’s office and City Hall.\n\nIn 2013, Seabon filed accounts to Companies House saying its income was just £1. The firm was wound up in February 2016. According to an analysis of the records, Seabon was involved in transactions worth $9bn. Another firm – Ronida Invest LLP, registered in Newhall Street, Birmingham – processed $6.4bn.\n\nProsecutors in eastern Europe claim both firms were set up for the purposes of fraud.\n\nThe records also give an insight into Russian shopping habits, although the customers in many cases are unknown. They bought diamonds from a jewellers in Bond Street, furs from brokers in north London, and chandeliers from a Chelsea boutique.\n\nThe scheme was also used for a wealthy Russian to pay for his son’s boarding fees at Millfield, a prestigious school in Somerset.\n\n\n\nOften, the information in the notes section of wire transfers was misleading. One bank payment of $500,000 was marked down in records as “notebooks”. Actually, it was spent on fur.\n\nA thousand miles from Moscow: how Putin forged his Russian heartland | Anne Garrels Read more\n\nThe scheme that allowed the transfer of money from east to west was unravelled by police following the launch of the inquiry in 2014. The OCCRP – which first reported the story – originally called it “the Russian Laundromat”.\n\nTypically, two firms would pretend to lend money to one another, with the sums underwritten by Russian businesses. One company would then “default” on the loan. Judges would certify the “debt” as authentic, allowing the Russian businesses to send cash to an account in Moldova. From there it went to Latvia, inside the EU.\n\nAccounts held at 19 Russian banks were involved in the scheme. In 2014, it was reported that one financial institution was the Russian Land Bank (RZB). A bank board member at the time was Igor Putin.\n\nDetectives say accounts at RZB transferred about $9.7bn to accounts at Moldova’s Moldindconbank. The cash was then moved to Trasta Komercbanka in Riga.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A view of Riga. Photograph: Alamy\n\nRZB’s director Alexander Grigoriev was arrested in Moscow in 2015, a year after his bank was shut down for money-laundering offences.\n\nSources told the OCCRP that Grigoriev had links to the FSB, Russia’s main spy agency.\n\nHe has denied wrongdoing and says he is a respectable citizen. He remains in custody, accused of stealing assets in a different case.\n\nIgor Putin declined to comment. In a letter written in 2014, he said: “My personal experience, gained in recent years, proves the truth of the thesis that the Russian banking system should be radically rehabilitated and cleaned of troubled banks headed by people with doubtful reputations.”\n\nContact the Guardian securely Read more\n\nTrasta, the Latvian bank at the centre of the scandal, was closed in 2016. Maija Treija, deputy director of Latvia’s finance ministry, said it lost its licence due to money laundering. Of the billions sent from Russia, she said: “Obviously it was money either stolen or with criminal origin.” The fight against money laundering was a “never-ending story”, she told the Finnish broadcaster YLE.\n\nThe involvement of Moldova’s banks in the scandal led to a political crisis that has seen five prime ministers come and go in the last two years.\n\nFormer and current officials working at Moldova’s central bank were detained by prosecutors last August suspected of turning a blind eye to information on money laundering carried out through Moldindconbank.\n\nThe fraud has also sparked a row with Moscow. This month, Moldova’s parliament said Russia’s FSB had “abusively treated” Moldovan officials arriving in the Russian Federation. It linked their harassment to Moldova’s Laundromat investigation and said some of the money had been used to try to bribe Moldovan MPs.\n\nThe FSB – run by Vladimir Putin before he became prime minister and president – had used part of the Laundromat money to further Russian state interests, Moldovan officials said.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/20/british-banks-handled-vast-sums-of-laundered-russian-money","1489982400.0"
"'A reckoning for our species': the philosopher prophet of the Anthropocene\nA few years ago, Björk began corresponding with a philosopher whose books she admired. “hi timothy,” her first message to him began. “i wanted to write this letter for a long time.” She was trying to give a name to her own singular genre, to label her work for posterity before the critics did. She asked him to help define the nature of her art – “not only to define it for me, but also for all my friends, and a generation actually.”\n\nIt turned out the philosopher, Timothy Morton, was a fan of Björk. Her music, he told her, had been “a very deep influence on my way of thinking and life in general”. The sense of eerie intimacy with other species, the fusion of moods in her songs and videos – tenderness and horror, weirdness and joy – “is the feeling of ecological awareness”, he said. Morton’s own work is about the implications of this strange awareness – the knowledge of our interdependence with other beings – which he believes undermines long-held assumptions about the separation between humanity and nature. For him, this is the defining characteristic of our times, and it is compelling us to change our “core ideas of what it means to exist, what Earth is, what society is”.\n\n'A reckoning for our species': the philosopher prophet of the Anthropocene – podcast Read more\n\nOver the past decade, Morton’s ideas have been spilling into the mainstream. Hans Ulrich Obrist, the artistic director of London’s Serpentine gallery, and perhaps the most powerful figure in the contemporary art world, is one of his loudest cheerleaders. Obrist told readers of Vogue that Morton’s books are among the pre-eminent cultural works of our time, and recommends them to many of his own collaborators. The acclaimed artist Olafur Eliasson has been flying Morton around the world to speak at his major exhibition openings. Excerpts from Morton’s correspondence with Björk were published as part of her 2015 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nMorton’s terminology is “slowly infecting all the humanities”, says his friend and fellow thinker Graham Harman. Though many academics have a reputation for writing exclusively for their colleagues down the hall, Morton’s peculiar conceptual vocabulary – “dark ecology”, “the strange stranger”, “the mesh” – has been picked up by writers in a cornucopia of fields, from literature and epistemology to legal theory and religion. Last year, he was included in a much-discussed list of the 50 most influential living philosophers. His ideas have also percolated into traditional media outlets such as Newsweek, the New Yorker and the New York Times.\n\nPart of what makes Morton popular are his attacks on settled ways of thinking. His most frequently cited book, Ecology Without Nature, says we need to scrap the whole concept of “nature”. He argues that a distinctive feature of our world is the presence of ginormous things he calls “hyperobjects” – such as global warming or the internet – that we tend to think of as abstract ideas because we can’t get our heads around them, but that are nevertheless as real as hammers. He believes all beings are interdependent, and speculates that everything in the universe has a kind of consciousness, from algae and boulders to knives and forks. He asserts that human beings are cyborgs of a kind, since we are made up of all sorts of non-human components; he likes to point out that the very stuff that supposedly makes us us – our DNA – contains a significant amount of genetic material from viruses. He says that we’re already ruled by a primitive artificial intelligence: industrial capitalism. At the same time, he believes that there are some “weird experiential chemicals” in consumerism that will help humanity prevent a full-blown ecological crisis.\n\nMorton’s theories might sound bizarre, but they are in tune with the most earth-shaking idea to emerge in the 21st century: that we are entering a new phase in the history of the planet – a phase that Morton and many others now call the “Anthropocene”.\n\nFor the past 12,000 years, human beings lived in a geological epoch called the Holocene, known for its relatively stable, temperate climes. It was, you might say, the California of planetary history. But it is coming to an end. Recently, we have begun to alter the Earth so drastically that, according to many scientists, a new epoch is dawning. After the briefest of geological vacations, we seem to be entering a more volatile period.\n\nThe term Anthropocene, from the Ancient Greek word anthropos, meaning “human”, acknowledges that humans are the major cause of the earth’s current transformation. Extreme weather, submerged cities, acute resource shortages, vanished species, lakes turned to deserts, nuclear fallout: if there is still human life on earth tens of thousands of years from now, societies that we can’t imagine will have to grapple with the changes we are wreaking today. Morton has noted that 75% of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at this very moment will still be there in half a millennium. That’s 15 generations away. It will take another 750 generations, or 25,000 years, for most of the those gases to be absorbed into the oceans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A dried-up reservoir in South Korea. Photograph: Yonhap/EPA\n\nThe Anthropocene is not only a period of manmade disruption. It is also a moment of blinking self-awareness, in which the human species is becoming conscious of itself as a planetary force. We’re not only driving global warming and ecological destruction; we know that we are.\n\nOne of Morton’s most powerful insights is that we are condemned to live with this awareness at all times. It’s there not only when politicians gather to discuss international environmental agreements, but when we do something as mundane as chat about the weather, pick up a plastic bag at the supermarket or water the lawn. We live in a world with a moral calculus that didn’t exist before. Now, doing just about anything is an environmental question. That wasn’t true 60 years ago – or at least people weren’t aware that it was true. Tragically, it is only by despoiling the planet that we have realised just how much a part of it we are.\n\nMorton believes that this constitutes a revolution in our understanding of our place in the universe on a par with those fomented by Copernicus, Darwin and Freud. He is just one of thousands of geologists, climate scientists, historians, novelists and journalists writing about this upheaval, but, perhaps better than anyone else, he captures in words the uncanny feeling of being present at the birth of this extreme age.\n\n“There you are, turning the ignition of your car,” he writes. “And it creeps up on you.” Every time you fire up your engine you don’t mean to harm the Earth, “let alone cause the Sixth Mass Extinction Event in the four-and-a-half billion-year history of life on this planet”. But “harm to Earth is precisely what is happening”. Part of what’s so uncomfortable about this is that our individual acts may be statistically and morally insignificant, but when you multiply them millions and billions of times – as they are performed by an entire species – they are a collective act of ecological destruction. Coral bleaching isn’t just occurring over yonder, on the Great Barrier Reef; it’s happening wherever you switch on the air conditioning. In short, Morton says, “everything is interconnected”.\n\nAs Morton’s work spreads beyond cultural hierophants such as Björk to the pages of major news outlets, he is arguably becoming our most popular guide to the new epoch. Yes, he has some seemingly crazy ideas about what it’s like to be alive right now – but what it’s like to be alive right now, in the Anthropocene, is pretty crazy.\n\nIn the course of its young life, the Anthropocene has grown into a concept as grand in its scope as any other world-historical paradigm worth its salt (which, if it’s sea salt, now includes a good dose of synthetic waste in tiny particles called microplastics). What began as a technical debate within the earth sciences has led, in Morton’s view, to a confrontation with some of our most basic ways of understanding the world. In the Anthropocene, he writes, we are undergoing “a traumatic loss of coordinates”.\n\nThe Anthropocene idea is generally attributed to the Nobel prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and the biologist Eugene Stoermer, who started popularising the term in 2000. From the outset, many took Crutzen and Stoermer’s concept seriously, even if they disagreed with it. Since the late 20th century, scientists have viewed geological time as a drama punctuated by great cataclysms, not merely a gradual accretion of incremental changes, and it made sense to see humanity itself as the latest cataclysm.\n\nImagine geologists from a future civilisation examining the layers of rock that are in the slow process of forming today, the way we examine the rock strata that formed as the dinosaurs died off. That civilisation will see evidence of our sudden (in geological terms) impact on the planet – including fossilised plastics and layers both of carbon, from burning carbon fuels, and of radioactive particles, from nuclear testing and explosions – just as clearly as we see evidence of the dinosaurs’ rapid demise. We can already observe these layers forming today.\n\nFor a couple of years, a lively debate over the usefulness of the concept unfolded. Detractors argued that humanity’s “geological signal” was not yet loud enough to justify the coronation of a new epoch, or that the term had no scientific use. Supporters wondered when they should date the Anthropocene’s start. To the advent of agriculture, many millennia ago? To the invention of the steam engine in the 18th century and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution? To 5.29am on 16 July 1945, the moment when the first-ever nuclear test exploded over the New Mexico desert? (Morton, in his all-embracing way, treats each of these moments as pivotal.) Then, in 2002, Crutzen set out his arguments in the scientific journal Nature. The idea of a moment in planetary history in which human influence was predominant seemed to tie together so many disparate developments – from retreating glaciers to fresh thinking about the limits of capitalism – that the term quickly spread to other earth sciences, and then beyond.\n\nSince then, at least three academic journals devoted to the Anthropocene have been founded, several universities have established formal research groups to ponder its implications, Stanford students have started a popular podcast titled Generation Anthropocene, and thousands of articles and books have been written on the subject, in fields ranging from economics to poetry.\n\nSome thinkers object to the term, arguing that it reinforces the human-centric view of the world that has led us to the verge of ecological catastrophe. Others say the blame for the despoliation of the Earth should be laid at the feet not of humanity in general, but of (predominantly white, western and male) capitalism. Several alternative designations have been minted, including “Capitalocene”, but none has caught on. They don’t have the disquieting existential ring of Anthropocene, which stresses both our culpability and our fragility as humans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef. Photograph: Reuters\n\nAround 2011, the Anthropocene “began to crop up regularly in newspapers for the first time”, according to the scholar Jeremy Davies’s recent history of the concept. The BBC, the Economist, National Geographic, Science and others covered the idea. Planetary changes had increasingly led journalists to set their environmental reporting in the context of geohistory – atmospheric carbon dioxide levels of 400 parts per million? Not seen since the Pliocene, three million years ago – and the Anthropocene became a useful shorthand for placing human activity in the perspective of geological deep time. For Morton, who had recently begun writing about it, it captured his concern with the way beings of different kinds, including humans, depend on each other for their existence – a fact the various calamities of the Anthropocene drove home.\n\nIn 2014, the Anthropocene was inducted into the Oxford English Dictionary, and last year, the epoch was formally endorsed by a working group within the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the official keeper of geological time. As a tentative start date, they chose the year 1950, when one of the clearest markers of human activity shows up globally in the earth’s crust: plutonium isotopes from widespread nuclear testing. The working group’s announcement was considered so significant that it made the front page of the Guardian. (Across the media, the Anthropocene is now used to frame everything from fiction reviews to discussions of the Donald Trump presidency.) As Jan Zalasiewicz, the chair of the group and one of the leading scientists studying the Anthropocene, said at the time, the new epoch “sets a different trajectory for the Earth system” and we are only now “realising the scale and permanence of the change”.\n\nThere have been periods of intense climate fluctuation coupled with mass extinction before. The most recent was 66m years ago, when a meteorite six miles in diameter struck what is now the Yucatán Peninsula. The impact released an estimated 2m times the energy of the most powerful atomic bomb ever detonated, altering the planet’s atmosphere and wiping out three-quarters of its species. But that was a comparatively simple event, which the physical sciences are well-equipped to understand.\n\nTo make sense of an epochal change that is being driven by human activity, we need more than geology, meteorology and chemistry. If this is a reckoning for our species, we need an intellectual guide – someone to tell us just how panicked we should be, and how our recognition that we are transforming the planet will change us in turn.\n\nThe awareness we’ve gained in the Anthropocene is not generally a happy one. Many environmentalists now warn of impending global catastrophe and urge industrial societies to change course. Morton stakes out a more iconoclastic position. Instead of raising the ecological alarm like some Paul Revere of the apocalypse, he advocates what he calls “dark ecology,” which holds that the much-feared catastrophe has, in fact, already occurred.\n\nMorton means not only that irreversible global warming is under way, but also something more wide-reaching. “We Mesopotamians” – as he calls the past 400 or so generations of humans living in agricultural and industrial societies – thought that we were simply manipulating other entities (by farming and engineering, and so on) in a vacuum, as if we were lab technicians and they were in some kind of giant petri dish called “nature” or “the environment”. In the Anthropocene, Morton says, we must wake up to the fact that we never stood apart from or controlled the non-human things on the planet, but have always been thoroughly bound up with them. We can’t even burn, throw or flush things away without them coming back to us in some form, such as harmful pollution. Our most cherished ideas about nature and the environment – that they are separate from us, and relatively stable – have been destroyed.\n\nMorton likens this realisation to detective stories in which the hunter realises he is hunting himself (his favourite examples are Blade Runner and Oedipus Rex). “Not all of us are prepared to feel sufficiently creeped out” by this epiphany, he says. But there’s another twist: even though humans have caused the Anthropocene, we cannot control it. “Oh, my God!” Morton exclaimed to me in mock horror at one point. “My attempt to escape the web of fate was the web of fate.”\n\nThe chief reason that we are waking up to our entanglement with the world we have been destroying, Morton says, is our encounter with the reality of hyperobjects – the term he coined to describe things such as ecosystems and black holes, which are “massively distributed in time and space” compared to individual humans. Hyperobjects might not seem to be objects in the way that, say, billiard balls are, but they are equally real, and we are now bumping up against them consciously for the first time. Global warming might have first appeared to us as a bit of funny local weather, then as a series of independent manifestations (an unusually torrential flood here, a deadly heatwave there), but now we see it as a unified phenomenon, of which extreme weather events and the disruption of the old seasons are only elements.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Yueyaquan Crescent Lake in north-west China. Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty\n\nIt is through hyperobjects that we initially confront the Anthropocene, Morton argues. One of his most influential books, itself titled Hyperobjects, examines the experience of being caught up in – indeed, being an intimate part of – these entities, which are too big to wrap our heads around, and far too big to control. We can experience hyperobjects such as climate in their local manifestations, or through data produced by scientific measurements, but their scale and the fact that we are trapped inside them means that we can never fully know them. Because of such phenomena, we are living in a time of quite literally unthinkable change.\n\nThis leads Morton to one of his most sweeping claims: that the Anthropocene is forcing a revolution in human thought. Advances in science are now underscoring how “enmeshed” we are with other beings – from the microbes that account for roughly half the cells in our bodies, to our reliance for survival on the Earth’s electromagnetic heat shield. At the same time, hyperobjects, in their unwieldy enormity, alert us to the absolute boundaries of science, and therefore the limits of human mastery. Science can only take us so far. This means changing our relationship with the other entities in the universe – whether animal, vegetable or mineral – from one of exploitation through science to one of solidarity in ignorance. If we fail to do this, we will continue to wreak havoc on the planet, threatening the ways of life we hold dear, and even our very existence. In contrast to utopian fantasies that we will be saved by the rise of artificial intelligence or some other new technology, the Anthropocene teaches us that we can’t transcend our limitations or our reliance on other beings. We can only live with them.\n\nThat might sound gloomy, but Morton glimpses in it a liberation. If we give up the delusion of controlling everything around us, we might refocus ourselves on the pleasure we take in other beings and life itself. Enjoyment, Morton believes, might be the thing that turns us on to a new kind of politics. “You think ecologically tuned life means being all efficient and pure,” the tweet pinned to the top of his Twitter timeline reads. “Wrong. It means you can have a disco in every room of your house.”\n\nThose words are typical of his thought, which often sets out from the dismal familiar, but then veers wildly off the beaten track. “There’s something truly hopeful in his work,” Hans Ulrich Obrist says of Morton. “Hope and maybe even optimism are somehow in there.” Morton has a story about converting his home outside Houston, where he holds a chair at Rice University, to wind-generated electricity. After a day or two of “feeling very righteous and holy,” he realised he could now have “full-on strobes and decks and people partaying for hours and hours, all day, every day,” while causing far less damage to the planet. “And that’s the ecological future, actually.”\n\nOne Saturday morning last autumn, I went looking for Morton at the Serpentine Galleries’ annual festival of ideas, where he was to speak later that day. Over the previous few weeks, he had been in Seoul to help Olafur Eliasson open a solo exhibition; in Singapore, to speak at the Future Cities conference; in Brussels, to give a talk titled “Nature Isn’t Real” in a public park at night (he said 250 people showed up); at the University of Exeter, where he outlined “rocking”, his new theory of action, which he described as “a queering of the theistic categories of active versus passive”; in Rome, where he spent his time, among other things, drinking martinis; and in Paris, where he went raving with his friend Ingrid and was so overcome with emotion and exhaustion that he spent some of the night lying in the middle of the dancefloor.\n\nIf you had to select an avatar for the Anthropocene, Morton might be an appropriate choice. He has arctic-blue eyes that at once shock and appear shocked. Combined with a slight pudginess that suggests physical vulnerability, an eczematic redness to his face, and a thistle of thin blond hair, he looks as if he has survived some kind of fallout. Indeed, he is something of a man afflicted. Among other things, he suffers from severe sleep apnoea, severe depression, severe migraines, and, it seemed to me over the course of our conversations, the occasional bout of mild paranoia. Obrist, who has recorded more than 2,500 hours of interviews with artists and philosophers, told me that Morton is the only one who became “so emotional that actually he starts to cry”. (They had been discussing mass extinction.)\n\nEarlier in the year, when I had spoken to Morton on video calls, he had been ebullient. Now, sitting at the back of the gallery’s restaurant, which had been converted into a performance hall, he seemed to be running on fumes. He had already published 14 essays that year, while continuing work on his two upcoming books. In the next few weeks, he was speaking in Chicago, at Yale, in Seoul (again), Munich and, finally, convening with members of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to contemplate the kinds of messages we should be sending into space on a potential reboot of the Voyager mission. (The original, launched in 1977, sent two spacecraft hurtling beyond our solar system; each contained a 12-inch gold-plated record engraved with sounds and images representing humanity and other earthly beings.) By the end of 2016, as he later wrote on his blog, Morton had racked up 350,000 air miles.\n\nMorton’s itinerary was an index of how popular the notion of the Anthropocene has become, and how deeply his approach to it resonates with our increasingly disquieting experience of the world. Poring over his books, or speaking to him in person, one starts to suspect that what is outlandish in his thinking and personality actually reflects something truly strange about the world. Over lunch, Morton ordered a chicken salad sandwich – an earlier experiment with veganism had lapsed – and we discussed the development of his thought. As he ate, I was reminded of a recent report that almost 60bn chickens are slaughtered globally every year, which, in the words of Jan Zalasiewicz, means that their carcasses have now been “fossilised in thousands of landfill sites and on street corners around the world”. That thought leads immediately to another one: about the bacterial “superbugs” we have created through widespread use of antibiotics, especially in industrial livestock production. From there, it’s only a short jump to thinking about other strange phenomena in our new epoch, like rocks formed from plastic and seashells, and changes in the earth’s rotation caused by melting ice sheets. Once you start listing these unsettling Anthropocene facts, there’s no end to it.\n\nIt’s possible, when one encounters Morton for the first or second time, to wonder if there’s something concocted about his hippie disposition, his emotionality, his intellectual flair. But his childhood friends and relatives say that his visceral engagement with ecology, and his academic prowess, go back to his childhood. Morton was born in north-west London, in 1968, in the midst of a period when a growing awareness of ecological threat still went hand in hand with the sense that people could change the world for the better, possibly under the influence of LSD. After his parents, who were both concert violinists, divorced in the late 1970s, his father sailed off on a Greenpeace protest trawler; his mother was a committed feminist who was active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘I like to think of myself as the corniest, most awful thing you could possibly imagine’ … Tim Morton. Photograph: Max Burkhalter for the Guardian\n\nFrom early on, Morton was an academic standout. He received the top scholarship at the elite St Paul’s School in London five years in a row, and then went to Oxford to read English. He got the highest marks in his subject across the university in his first-year exams, and a first in his finals. Doing well academically was important to Morton, but eventually he came to the realisation that it’s “actually secondary to this other thing, called being alive”. His life took on something of the shape his work would later adopt. It was about more than accumulating knowledge; it was also about pursuing pleasure and intimacy. In his second year as an undergraduate, he and his roommate, Mark Payne, who is now a classicist at the University of Chicago, would “do acid and listen to Butthole Surfers and talk about Blake”. (Payne says they did acid and talked about Milton.) He also fell in love for the first time. As a graduate student, Morton wore his hair long, with a suede jacket, and decked himself out in beads. His PhD thesis, which is recognised as an important contribution to the study of Romanticism, showed that the vegetarianism of Percy and Mary Shelley was intimately entwined with their politics and art. Paul Hamilton, who supervised some of Morton’s graduate work, told me that, when it came to the Shelleys, Morton “changed the lights for everyone”.\n\nDespite the success of his dissertation, Morton struggled to land an academic position, and even contemplated killing himself. Eventually, he found a job at the University of Colorado, Boulder, before moving on, in 2003, to the University of California in Davis, north-east of San Francisco. Being in northern California seemed to season his thought, and he began focusing on explicitly ecological questions, such as what we write about when we write about nature. In a canny bit of self-branding, he also took to calling himself Professor of Literature and Environment.\n\nOver the next few years, Morton published his book challenging the idea of “nature”, as well as a follow-up asking what it means for us to rely in unfathomably complex ways on a countless number of other beings. He also joined a small, contentious philosophical movement called object-oriented ontology, or OOO, which holds that every being, including humans, can only ever grasp the world in its own limited ways. (In other words, we will never know what flies know, and vice versa.) Then, in 2012, Morton left California for his current chair at Rice, one of the most well-regarded universities in America.\n\nWith the security of tenure and the successive infusions of Buddhism and OOO into his thinking, Morton started to write in a more riffing, personal style. His talk of discos in his wind-powered home and the cringey way he elongates “partaying” aren’t incidental to his project. “Inevitably, ecological awareness has this kind of 70s flavour to it,” he says. It’s an aesthetic he embraces, “in all of its flared weirdness”. There’s a bell-bottomed capaciousness to his intellectual style, too. He may well be the only person ever to grace a list of the most influential living philosophers and have a songwriting credit on an album that reached No 4 in the UK charts (Stacked Up by Senser, from 1994).\n\nHe has followed in the footsteps of thinkers such as Jacques Derrida and Edward Said in giving the prestigious Wellek Lecture, at the University of California in Irvine – but he has also performed at Glastonbury, playing music for fire-juggling performance artists, and served as a consultant on the Steve Coogan series The Trip to Italy. Although he’s about to publish a book attempting to fuse dark ecology with Marxism (“The tweak is pretty intense, and not everyone’s going to like it,” he says), he also has one forthcoming for Pelican books, Being Ecological, which is meant to enchant the general public. The first sentence is: “This book contains no ecological facts whatsoever.” Though several of his books are dedicated to the customary people (spouse, children, siblings), he has also dedicated one to his cat, the late Allan Whiskersworth. One of the most engrossing posts on his blog, which he updates regularly, is a critical inquiry into giant penises drawn on rooftops so they can be discovered via Google Earth. He’s deep into Shambhala Buddhism and has circumambulated Mount Kailash in Tibet. Not long ago, he received a very moving Tarot reading.\n\nIf people find most of this ridiculous, all the better. “I like to think of myself as the corniest, most awful thing you could possibly imagine,” he told me. He has achieved the usual trappings of academic success; now that he’s through the metaphorical metal detectors of polite society, he has a different aim. “I can get quite well known, and then I can unleash this kind of anarchist-hippie thing that I’ve been holding like a very precious liquid, carefully, without spilling any, for years and years and years,” he said. “And now I’m going to pour it everywhere.”\n\nWhen it was time for his talk at the Serpentine, Morton appeared in a tight-fitting, silver Versace shirt of the sort a camp Bond villain might wear. His lecture was titled “Stuff Can Happen”.\n\n“You wouldn’t believe how many philosophers are afraid of movement,” he began. He went on to discuss two strands of thought in the work of the philosopher Hegel. One problem with Hegel, Morton said, “the problem I call macro-Hegel, is that macro-Hegel makes the slinky move up the stairs, improbably. And at the top of the stairs, like the killer in Psycho, is waiting, drum roll, you guessed it, white western patriarchy in the guise of the Prussian state.” (I had not guessed this; should I have?) “So macro-Hegel blows it.”\n\nIt seemed an odd way to approach a lecture to a motley crew of artists, activists, students and musicians. Even as someone with an interest in Morton’s work, I soon felt bored and distracted. The man standing next to me, an American scholar with an acerbic sense of humour, rolled his eyes and whispered a comment to the effect of “What is this bullshit?”\n\nDespite Morton’s popularity, this isn’t an uncommon response to his work. The Morton detractors with whom I spoke accused him of misunderstanding contemporary science, like quantum mechanics and set theory, and then claiming his distortions as support for his wild ideas. They shared a broad critique that reminded me of the sceptical adage, “If you open your mind too far, your brains will fall out.” The slurry of interesting ideas in Morton’s work doesn’t hold together under scrutiny, they say. The philosopher Ray Brassier, who was once associated with OOO, has charged Morton and his blogging confrères with generating “an online orgy of stupidity”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Morton giving a speech at the Serpentine Galleries in London in October 2016.\n\nOther critics, especially on the left, complain that Morton’s conception of the Anthropocene glosses over issues of race, class, gender and colonialism by blaming the entire species for the damage inflicted by a privileged minority. The focus on the human enshrined in the term Anthropocene is a particular target for critics. By referring to humans as a unified whole, they argue that Morton effaces distinctions between the affluent west and the other members of humanity, many of whom were living in a state of ecological catastrophe long before the notion of the Anthropocene became trendy on campuses in Europe and North America. Others say that Morton’s notion of politics is too woolly, or that the last thing we need when facing ecological challenges are abstract musings about the nature of objects.\n\nMorton’s defenders, however, see him as something of a Ralph Waldo Emerson for the Anthropocene: his writing has value, even if it doesn’t always stand up to philosophical scrutiny. “No one in a philosophy department is going to be taking Tim Morton seriously,” Claire Colebrook, a professor of English at Pennsylvania State University who has worked extensively on the Anthropocene, told me. But she teaches Morton’s work to undergraduates and they love it. “Why? Because they’re like, ‘Shut up and give me an idea!’”\n\nNot everything that Morton said to me in the course of our conversations struck me as philosophically or ecologically plausible. (“You and me, and our computers and that painting behind you and maybe one of the pigeons in the street – we’re going to get together and make a little anarchist collective, and the focus of this anarchist collective will be reading, um, the letters of Beethoven.”) But what attracts many to his ideas are not their cogency so much as their profusion and playfulness. Hans Ulrich Obrist and the artists Philippe Parreno and Olafur Eliasson all used the same word to describe his oeuvre: it’s a “toolbox”, they said, from which they can pluck useful ideas.\n\nThat toolbox may be useful to the rest of us, too. As global warming and other features of the Anthropocene intensify, our experience of this grave new age is bound to become ever weirder and more fraught. When that happens, more and more people are likely to seek out writings – such as Morton’s – that echo their experiences of alienation, as well as their yearning for hope. Some other thinkers seem to believe we can tidy up the world if we just have better, more logical, more rigorous ideas. Morton says we can tidy up our ideas all we want, but the world is going to remain a fundamentally messy place that will always resist our philosophical decluttering. What we need to do instead is get comfortable with this weirdness. During one of our earliest conversations, I told Morton I appreciated his work, to the extent I thought I understood it. “I think I understand it too, sometimes,” he replied.\n\nThere’s nothing like the prospect of an authoritarian strongman to make intellectuals, hippies, and, above all, hippie intellectuals appear hopelessly ineffectual. Compared to organising protests or setting up a recurring donation to the American Civil Liberties Union, talk of deep time or of effacing the false ontological divide between humanity and nature risks seeming rather fatuous.\n\nIn November, the week after the election of Donald Trump, Morton flew to New York to confab with the Nasa group about what a new Golden Record might contain. He was devastated by Trump’s victory, but not necessarily surprised that America had opted for what he called the political equivalent of a diet of vicodin and cinnamon buns. In his hotel room, he had a “private weeping session” while reading the David Malouf novel Fly Away Peter. Later, he went for a bite of sushi – in which mercury from coal-fired power plants, smelting metals and burning trash tends to accumulate, occasionally leading to poisoning – and got swept up in a large crowd. “I was in that first protest, man,” he told me. “I was in that first fucking anti-Trump protest at Trump Tower.” He quipped to his Twitter followers, and to the Nasa meeting, that he wanted to put the president-elect on the next Voyager probe.\n\nI wondered how potent Morton’s animistic politics would seem under the new dispensation. The day after his talk at the Serpentine in the autumn, I had eaten lunch with him, the performance artist Kathelin Gray and John Polk Allen, AKA Johnny Dolphin, the prime mover behind Biosphere 2, a planetary microcosm built inside what is essentially a gigantic test tube in the Arizona desert. The conversation, in the course of meandering from places on the globe with special energy (the Himalayas, Chaco Canyon) to the “lunatic asylum for clever people” that is Oxford, turned toward solidarity with other species.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico. Photograph: Richard Susanto/Getty Images/Flickr RF\n\n“I’ve always called other things ‘people’,” Gray said. “My Native American friends are very happy about that.”\n\n“How could you not call them people?” Morton responded.\n\nGray told a story of snakes she had known. Morton, evidently moved, put his hand on his chest. “You had two friends called Snakey?” he said. “That’s wonderful.”\n\nThis had all sounded a bit ludicrous, even before Trump got elected. But somewhere in these schmaltzy attempts to express their affinity with other creatures was a genuine desire to move towards the sort of radically pluralist politics that Morton advocates. “Don’t hide under a rock, for heaven’s sake,” Morton had said to me at one point. “Go out in the street and start making any and as many kinds of political affiliations with as many kinds of beings, human or otherwise, that you possibly can, with a view to creating a more non-violent and just, for everybody, ecological world.” It was hard to argue with those aims. We can’t debate with other species, but the Anthropocene makes it clear that we need to include their wellbeing among our goals.\n\nMorton’s own political emphasis seemed to change after the election. Wind-powered house parties and interspecies reading groups were out. Now, the whole point, he said, was “to freakin’ crush these fascists over and over and over again”.\n\nGeneration Anthropocene: How humans have altered the planet for ever Read more\n\nStill, the Anthropocene isn’t going away just because a venal troll in a baggy suit is sitting in the White House. The build-up of carbon in the air and nitrogen in the soil; the acidification of the oceans and the desertification of once-fertile lands; the counterpane of radioactive isotopes (from nuclear testing) and plastic (from consumer packaging) that blankets the globe; the species after species extinguished – the list of dramatic changes to the planet goes on. The politics of today may be more urgent than ever, but the need for a politics of tomorrow hasn’t gone away.\n\nA few days after the election, Morton regained his sense of humour and began to laugh about the president-elect, “this little orange guy with a huge, yellow pile of Cheetos on his head”. Yes, Morton was going to spend the next months, or however long it took, fighting fascists on campus and wherever else he could be heard, but he was also continuing to proclaim his unusual view of ecology.\n\n“Let’s put some house music on,” Morton said at the end of one of our longest conversations. “Even if it’s true that we really are screwed, let’s not spend the rest of our lives on this planet telling ourselves how screwed we are.”\n\nWhat should we do instead?\n\n“Shake hands with a hedgehog and disco.”\n\nMain photograph by Max Burkhalter for the Guardian\n\n• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/15/timothy-morton-anthropocene-philosopher","1497499200.0"
"Kim Jong-nam’s Death: A Geopolitical Whodunit\nIn the days since the killing was caught on video, the drama has had an ever-expanding and multinational cast of characters — women from Indonesia and Vietnam accused of carrying out the attack, one of whom was apparently wearing a white shirt emblazoned with the letters LOL; a Malaysian boyfriend; and others believed to be North Korean agents.\n\nOn Wednesday, Malaysia’s police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said a senior diplomat at the North Korean Embassy and an employee of the North Korean state-owned airline, Air Koryo, were also wanted for questioning. Another North Korean, who was not identified, was also being sought. Mr. Khalid also said that extra police officers had been sent to the morgue where Mr. Kim’s body was being kept after an attempt to break into the facility was detected.\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea has refused to even acknowledge that the dead man was Kim Jong-nam and has accused Malaysia of carrying out a politically motivated investigation to placate South Korea and the United States.\n\nNorth Korea has nonetheless demanded that the body be sent there and, in a statement on Wednesday, the North Korean Embassy said the two women were innocent and should be freed.\n\nIf the women really had poison on their hands, the embassy statement said, “then how is it possible that these female suspects could still be alive?”\n\nOne possible theory is that each woman used a single chemical that became lethal only when mixed with another. The Malaysian police, however, said that the substance or substances used in the attack had not yet been identified.\n\nNorth Korea has denied any involvement in the killing, which is likely to anger China, its main ally, which has been seen as a protector of Kim Jong-nam.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kim had long been on a hit list drawn up by his half brother, Kim Jong-un, according to South Korean intelligence. The younger Mr. Kim, 33, has ordered the execution of scores of senior officials, including at least one disfavored relative, and may have been prompted to act if he believed that Beijing saw his half brother as a possible replacement for him.\n\nMalaysian authorities say the two women arrested, Doan Thi Huong, 28, and Siti Aisyah, 25, were recruited, trained and equipped by four North Koreans who have since fled to their home country.\n\nIf the attack was a plot by North Korea, it would not be the first time it had tried to kill Kim Jong-nam.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 2010, according to South Korean investigators, a North Korean agent based in China received a special order from Pyongyang: “Terminate” Kim Jong-nam and bring his body to the North.\n\nThat agent, Kim Young-soo, was told that Kim Jong-nam was going to travel to China from Singapore, where he was then living. The agent’s boss gave him a bundle of cash and ordered him to bribe a taxi driver to run over Mr. Kim in a fake traffic accident.\n\nThe plot was scrapped when Mr. Kim failed to arrive as planned. But it came to light in 2012, when the agent was caught entering South Korea and confessed under interrogation.\n\nSince 2011, when Kim Jong-un succeeded his father as North Korea’s ruler, there has been a standing order to assassinate his half brother, South Korean intelligence officials said last week. There was another assassination attempt against him in 2012.\n\nMr. Kim was so afraid that he begged for his life in a letter to his half brother in 2012.\n\n“Please withdraw the order to punish me and my family,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in the letter. “We have nowhere to hide. The only way to escape is to choose suicide.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Troubled Family\n\nThe Kim family, which has ruled North Korea since its founding in 1948, has presided over a Shakespearean nest of internecine plots and family intrigue. Rival relatives have been sent into exile and occasional bloody purges have killed off anyone of questionable loyalty and set an example for others.\n\nKim Jong-nam was an early dropout in the Kim dynasty’s third-generation power struggle. Sidelined from the race to succeed his father since the 1970s, when his mother was abandoned by his father, he had been effectively shut out of power and shut off from his father since he was a teenager. South Korean officials say he never met his half brother Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe final straw for Kim Jong-nam was when he was caught entering Japan on a false Dominican Republic passport in 2001, embarrassing the family. He told Japanese officials that he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kim lived in exile, mostly in Macau, but enjoyed the affluent life of a globe-trotting playboy, sometimes traveling with a female bodyguard. While his father was still alive, the government in Pyongyang sent him cash allowances.\n\nHis uncle, Jang Song-thaek, became a father figure and his main connection to his country. South Korean officials said Mr. Kim was thought to have used that connection to conduct business for himself, like handling contracts involving North Korean minerals.\n\nMr. Kim often visited Kuala Lumpur, where Mr. Jang’s nephew, Jang Yong-chol, served as North Korean ambassador until 2013.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A bodyguard sat outside in the mall, visible through the window.\n\n“He was very humble, very friendly, a very nice guy,” Mr. Hwang said.\n\nMr. Kim never gave his name, but Mr. Hwang, who is from South Korea and has family in the North, recognized him. To be certain, he said he collected Mr. Kim’s dishes after a meal and sent them to the South Korean Embassy for fingerprint and DNA analysis, he said. The word came back that it was indeed Mr. Kim.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Kim Jong-un took power, he cut off his half brother’s allowance. In 2013, he executed their uncle, Mr. Jang, on charges of corruption and sedition. Mr. Jang’s nephew, the ambassador, was recalled the same year and is thought to have been executed.\n\nKim Jong-un may have been angered by reports that his half brother had once considered defecting to South Korea. After Kim Jong-nam’s assassination, some defectors claimed that he had been asked to serve as head of a government in exile. But Kim Jong-nam never formally proposed to defect, according to South Korean officials, and he had told reporters that he had no interest in politics, although he also criticized the dynastic succession in Pyongyang.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Setup\n\nWhen Mr. Kim arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 6, he was using a diplomatic passport with the name Kim Chol.\n\nBy then, it appears, the plot against him was already underway.\n\nFour North Korean men accused of organizing the attack had begun arriving on Jan. 31, nearly a week before Mr. Kim, the police say. Each one landed on a different day. The last one arrived Feb. 7, a day after Mr. Kim.\n\nUnlike most countries, Malaysia allows North Koreans to enter without a visa and makes it relatively easy for them to work. North Koreans have established a number of businesses in Malaysia to export products to other parts of the world and earn foreign currency to send home.\n\nThe four North Korean conspirators apparently recruited Ms. Huong and Ms. Siti from entertainment establishments. Ms. Siti worked as a “spa masseuse,” the police say, and Ms. Huong as an “entertainment outlet employee.”\n\nMs. Huong grew up in a small farming village in Vietnam about three hours south of Hanoi and studied pharmacy at a community college. Ms. Siti grew up in a farming village east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. She quit school after sixth grade, was married at 16 and divorced at 20, before she left for Malaysia.\n\nThere were reports that the women were duped, that they had been told they were participating in a prank. Indonesian officials said they thought Ms. Siti was tricked into thinking that she was part of a comedy video involving spraying liquid onto unwitting victims in public.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Khalid, the police chief, said they knew what they were doing. The women had practiced the attack at two malls, he said.\n\n“We strongly believe it is a planned thing and that they are being trained to do that,” he said. “It is not just shooting movies or a play thing. No way.”\n\nPhoto\n\nThe police say the plotters also brought in Ri Jong Chol, a North Korean who had been living and working in Kuala Lumpur since at least August. He was almost certainly a government agent, according to Thae Yong-ho, a North Korean diplomat who defected to the South last summer, because he was allowed to live with his family abroad.\n\nOn the morning of Feb. 13, Mr. Kim went to the airport to catch his flight home.\n\nSecurity videos show him entering the departure hall at Terminal 2 carrying a shoulder bag, checking the departure board and walking toward the check-in counter for AirAsia, a budget airline.\n\nAfter his encounter with the women, Mr. Kim approached airport staff and security officers, waving his hands toward his face repeatedly as he told them of the attack. They walked with him to the airport clinic one level down.\n\nWithin minutes, he was in an ambulance, but by then the poison was taking effect. He was dead before he reached the hospital, the police said.\n\nHis last words were, “Very painful, very painful. I was sprayed liquid,” China Press, a Malaysian Chinese-language newspaper, reported.\n\nThe police say the four North Korean conspirators watched the attack unfold. Soon after, they passed through immigration, had their passports stamped and left the country before the authorities realized Mr. Kim had been murdered. All are now believed to be in North Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Hwang said Mr. Kim had stopped coming to his restaurant around 2014, after his uncle’s execution, and may have fallen on lean times — which may explain why he had no bodyguards last week as he prepared to fly home on a budget carrier.\n\nMr. Hwang didn’t see him during his final trip to Kuala Lumpur and was surprised by his appearance in the security video.

Tillerson played down the threat. “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days,” he said.\n\nMr. Trump’s stark comments went well beyond the firm but measured language typically preferred by American presidents in confronting North Korea, and indeed seemed almost to echo the bellicose words used by Mr. Kim. Whether that message was mainly a bluff or an authentic expression of intent, it instantly scrambled the diplomatic equation in one of the world’s most perilous regions.\n\nSupporters suggested that Mr. Trump was trying to get Mr. Kim’s attention in a way that the North Korean leader would understand, while critics expressed concern that the American president could stumble into a war with devastating consequences.\n\n“This is a more dangerous moment than faced by Trump’s predecessors,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit group in Washington. “The normal nuanced diplomatic rhetoric coming out of Washington hasn’t worked in persuading the Kim regime of American resolve. This language underscores that the most powerful country in the world has its own escalatory and retaliatory options.”\n\nBut Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said it would be counterproductive. “President Trump is not helping the situation with his bombastic comments,” she said in a statement. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also took exception. “All it’s going to do is bring us closer to some kind of serious confrontation,” he told KTAR News radio.\n\nIn Guam, Governor Eddie Baza Calvo played down the North’s threat to the island in a video address on Wednesday. He said his administration had been in touch with the White House and U.S. military commanders and that there was “no change in the threat level resulting from North Korea events.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has accelerated its progress toward a working nuclear-tipped missile force since Mr. Trump, who has vowed not to let that happen, took office. Last month, the North successfully tested for the first time an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the continental United States.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday that American intelligence agencies had concluded that North Korea had miniaturized a warhead that could fit on top of one of its missiles. The Japanese government also said in an annual threat assessment on Tuesday that “it is possible that North Korea has already achieved the miniaturization of nuclear weapons and has acquired nuclear warheads.”\n\nBut experts said the main problem for North Korea is not miniaturization; the bombs are already judged small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, as a famous picture of Mr. Kim with an odd warhead resembling a disco ball seemed to make clear. The real test is whether a warhead can survive the intense heat of re-entry as it plunges through the atmosphere from space, a hurdle North Korea is not believed to have overcome.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a new sanctions resolution against North Korea over the weekend, the eighth since the country conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. Backers of the resolution said the new sanctions would cut North Korea’s meager annual export revenue by about a third, impeding its ability to raise cash for its weapons programs.\n\nThe sanctions ban the import of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood from North Korea. They also prohibit United Nations member nations from hosting any additional workers from the North above their current levels. Washington called the restrictions “the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation.”\n\nPhoto\n\nBut strong doubts remain over how rigorously China and Russia, the North’s two neighboring allies, will enforce the sanctions.\n\nEven before Mr. Trump’s comments, North Korea’s militant response to the sanctions on Tuesday was the strongest indication yet that it could conduct another nuclear or missile test, as it has often done in response to past United Nations sanctions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“Packs of wolves are coming in attack to strangle a nation,” the North Korean statement said. “They should be mindful that the D.P.R.K.’s strategic steps accompanied by physical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all its national strength,” it added, using the initials for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Trump’s “fire and fury” response echoed the kind of language the North Koreans themselves have used in the past. In the last few years, North Korean officials and the government news agency have repeatedly warned the United States and South Korea against any pre-emptive attack, with “sea of fire” a favorite phrase.\n\nAt one point, North Korea vowed that “everything will be reduced to ashes and flames the moment the first attack is unleashed”; at another, it vowed to “turn Washington, the stronghold of American imperialists and the nest of evil, and its followers, into a sea of fire.”\n\nThis week, after the United Nations vote, North Korea’s state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper said, “The day the United States dares tease our nation with a nuclear weapon and sanctions, the mainland United States will be catapulted into an unimaginable sea of fire.”\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Mr. Trump’s statement is among the most militant a president has made about North Korea, it may have been aimed as much at Beijing as at Pyongyang. By discussing military options, the administration may be trying to convince China and its president, Xi Jinping, that the status quo is dangerous because it risks war.\n\n“It may be a message to Xi Jinping that you have to be doing more than just sanctions at the U.N.,” said Joseph S. Nye Jr., a Harvard scholar who once ran the American government’s National Intelligence Council. “It may be a very rational, thought-out message,” rather than an emotional outburst, he added.\n\nBut after so many warnings of a trade war with China and other belligerent statements, Mr. Trump’s threat will probably be interpreted by Mr. Xi as “another thumping-the-table” exercise, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.\n\n“I guess Xi would not believe it as more than 30 to 40 percent true,” Mr. Shi said of the possibility that Mr. Trump would unleash a nuclear strike on North Korea.\n\nWhile Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has kept the door open for talks with North Korea during his travels in the region, other administration officials have said Mr. Trump is being presented with options for war. “The president has been very clear about it,” Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, said in an interview aired on MSNBC last weekend. “He said he’s not going to tolerate North Korea being able to threaten the United States.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGeneral McMaster added, however, that the administration would first explore “what can we do to make sure we exhaust our possibilities, and exhaust our other opportunities to accomplish this very clear objective of denuclearization of the peninsula short of war.”\n\nIn South Korea, some conservative politicians and analysts have called for the reintroduction of American tactical nuclear weapons to establish a “balance of terror” against the North. The United States withdrew nuclear weapons from the South in the early 1990s, but it occasionally sends nuclear-capable bombers and submarines in exercises.\n\nBut President Moon Jae-in on Monday warned against military action. “Above all, President Moon emphasized that South Korea can never accept a war erupting again on the Korean Peninsula,” his office said in a statement describing a 56-minute phone call with Mr. Trump. “He stressed that the North Korean nuclear issue must be resolved in a peaceful, diplomatic manner through a close coordination between South Korea and the United States.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/world/asia/north-korea-un-sanctions-nuclear-missile-united-nations.html","1502164800.0"
"Mother of Charlottesville victim says she won’t speak to Trump or forgive his comments\n\n\nHeather Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, receives a standing ovation during her remarks at a memorial service for her daughter. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThe mother of Heather Heyer, the woman killed in Charlottesville last weekend, said she has no plans to speak to President Trump after he equated protesters like her daughter with the white supremacists who had marched on the city.\n\n“After what he said about my child, and — it’s not that I saw somebody else’s tweets about him, I saw an actual clip of him at a press conference equating the protesters like Ms. Heyer with the KKK and the white supremacists,” Heyer’s mother, Susan Bro, told “Good Morning America” on Friday.\n\n“You can’t wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying I’m sorry,” Bro said. “I’m not forgiving for that.”\n\nMORNING EXCLUSIVE: Full interview with Susan Bro, mother of Heather Heyer, victim from the Charlottesville attack: https://t.co/jGJ0mfxdGD pic.twitter.com/CWQFdszQgr — Good Morning America (@GMA) August 18, 2017\n\nBro’s comments marked a sharp, personal response to Trump’s statement that “both sides” were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville that erupted when counterprotesters confronted white supremacists and neo-Nazis who had marched there for a rally.\n\nTrump said there were “two sides to a story” and said of the counter-protesters: “Do they have any semblance of guilt? Do they have any problem? I think they do.”\n\nIn his public statements, Trump has also expressed kind words for Heyer, tweeting that she was “a truly special young woman.”\n\nMemorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer, a truly special young woman.

Federal officials say the crash may have been a terrorist attack as well as a hate crime.\n\nBro said “three more frantic messages from press secretaries” followed throughout the day Wednesday, but she did not immediately respond because she was recovering from the service.\n\nIt was not until Thursday night that Bro said she was able to actually watch the news and see a clip of Trump’s comments for herself.\n\n“I’m not talking to the president now,” she said Friday. When asked what message she might have for Trump, Bro said: “Think before you speak.”\n\n[‘They tried to kill my child to shut her up,’ Heather Heyer’s mother mourns at funeral for woman killed during Nazi protest in Charlottesville]\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment Friday regarding Bro’s remarks.\n\nBro has also said that she has been the subject of threatening messages this week. She told MSNBC on Thursday that she received death threats since speaking about her daughter at Heyer’s memorial service in Charlottesville.\n\n“They tried to kill my child to shut her up, but guess what, you just magnified her,” Bro said during the service, prompting an ovation lasting nearly a minute and a half.\n\nSusan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, who was killed on Aug. 12 in Charlottesville while protesting white nationalists, urged others to fight injustice and speak up. (The Washington Post)\n\nTrump has drawn intense criticism for his response to the chaos in Charlottesville. His first remarks, delivered Saturday after Heyer was killed, prompted a backlash when Trump denounced “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” but did not specifically single out white supremacists or neo-Nazis.\n\nOn Monday, after mounting push-back, Trump called out those groups by name, saying that “racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs.” Bro released a statement that day thanking Trump for his “words of comfort and denouncing those who promote violence and hatred.”\n\nHowever, a day later Trump returned to his declaration that “both sides” were to blame for the violence during a remarkable, combative news conference in New York that set off a surge in public condemnation. Trump has bristled at criticism of his response, lashing out at Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) on Thursday morning for issuing a statement disapproving of Trump’s comments.\n\nDuring the same news conference, Trump also spoke positively about Heyer and thanked Bro for the statement she released about him.\n\n[Mother of slain Charlottesville protester says she’s received death threats]\n\nHe also excoriated James Alex Fields Jr., who police say plowed into Heyer and other activists on Saturday, assailing the man as “a disgrace to himself” and “a murderer.” Though Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said the attack fits the definition of domestic terrorism, Trump declined to call it terrorism when asked by a reporter.\n\nThe White House has not explained why officials waited four days before trying to connect Trump with Heyer’s relatives. In November, after a San Antonio police officer was shot and killed, Trump — then the president-elect — called his relatives the following day. Trump also met personally with the victims of an attack at Ohio State University carried out by a Somali refugee.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump did not say whether he will travel to Charlottesville, answering a question about that by mentioning a winery bearing his name in the city. Trump was also asked when he would reach out to Heyer’s family, and Trump did not directly respond, instead thanking Bro again for her statement.\n\n“Under the kind of stress that she is under and the heartache that she is under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won’t forget,” he said.\n\nThis story, first posted at 9:23 a.m., has been updated.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nTrump said he’s ‘sad’ to see Confederate statues coming down.

"Price of 40-year-old cancer drug hiked 1,400% by new owners\nPrices for a cancer drug called lomustine have skyrocketed nearly 1,400 percent since 2013, putting a potentially life-saving treatment out of reach for patients suffering from brain tumors and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Though the 40-year-old medication is no longer protected by patents, no generic version is available.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, lomustine was sold by Bristol-Myers Squib for years under the brand name CeeNU at a price of about $50 a capsule for the highest dose. The drugmaker sold lomustine in 2013 to a little-known Miami startup called NextSource, which proceeded to hike lomustine's price nine times since. It now charges about $768 per pill for the medication.\n\nAccording to an analysis done for the Journal by Truveen Health Analytics and Elsevier, NextSource this year raised prices for the drug, which it rebranded as Gleostine, by 12 percent in November following a 20 percent increase in August.\n\nNextSource CEO Robert DiCrisci told the Journal that the company sets its prices based on the costs it incurred in developing the medication and the benefits it provides patients. Like other drugmakers, the company provides discounts and financial assistance to those who can't afford its cost. A spokesperson for NextSource didn't respond to an email requesting comment for this story.\n\nHenry S. Friedman, a professor of neurosurgery at Duke University School of Medicine, accused NextSource of 'price-gouging' in an interview with the Journal, adding: 'People are not going to be able to afford it, or they're going to pay a lot of money and have financial liability.'\n\nAccording to the Journal, the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration is offering to expedite the regulatory review process for more than 300 drugs like lomustine that lack generic competitors although their patents have expired, part of the Trump administration's overall effort to lower pharmaceutical prices. Whether there is enough demand for a niche product like lomustine is hard to say, however.\n\nSoaring prices for cancer drugs are a concern for both patients and doctors because financial pressures can lead to delays in seeking treatment that can easily surpass six figures per year. A study published earlier this year in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found prices for 24 patented injectible Medicare Part B drugs rose an average of 18 percent annually over the past eight years on an inflation-adjusted basis. Prices continued to rise even when generic versions of the drug became available.\n\nPatients with cancer are among the most likely to feel the pain of recent drug price hikes. Novartis (NVS), the Swiss drugmaker, is charging $475,000 per patient for its Kymriah treatment for certain types of blood cancers. Another blood cancer medication developed by Gilead Sciences (GILD) called Yescarta costs $373,000. (According to Bloomberg News, patients have experienced delays in getting the breakthrough treatment because of payment delays by both private insurers and Medicare and Medicaid.) The brain tumor treatment called Alecensa is priced at nearly $160,000 a year.","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancer-drug-lomustine-price-hiked-1400-percent-by-new-owners/","None"
"68 Things You Cannot Say on China’s Internet\n“Detailed” plots involving prostitution, rape and masturbation are also forbidden. So are displays of “unhealthy marital values,” which the guidelines catalog as affairs, one-night stands, partner swapping and, simply but vaguely, “sexual liberation.”\n\nDespite the efforts of censors, the internet has long been the most freewheeling of China’s mass media, a platform where authors and artists — as well as entertainment studios — could reach audiences largely free of the Propaganda Department’s traditional controls on broadcasting, publishing, cinema and stage.\n\nBut the new restrictions — which expanded and updated a set of prohibitions issued five years ago — reflect an ambitious effort by President Xi Jinping’s government to impose discipline and rein in the web.\n\nThey were issued by the China Netcasting Services Association, which includes as members more than 600 companies, including the official Xinhua News Agency, the social media giants Sina and Tencent, the dominant search engine Baidu and the news aggregator Jinri Toutiao.\n\nVideo\n\nDavid Bandurski, an analyst and editor for the University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project, said the association’s rules created the illusion of industry consensus as the company’s acquiesced to what party officials call “self-discipline.”\n\n“Many of these companies are private, so it’s important for the leadership to have a means of bringing them together and creating a means of applying pressure on the collective,” he wrote in an email. “It is a tactic of co-option.”\n\nWriters, filmmakers, podcasters and others attributed the guidelines and other measures to a new prim and paternalistic ideology taking shape under Mr. Xi, who has called on party members to be “paragons of morality” in pursuit of what he calls the “China Dream.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany also attributed the tightening of controls to official nervousness ahead of a major Communist Party congress scheduled for October. The congress is expected to reshuffle the country’s leadership and consolidate President Xi’s already formidable power.\n\n“I feel like people say all the time that after the big congress, things will be O.K.,” said Fan Popo, a documentary filmmaker whose work has run afoul of online censorship because it explores the country’s conflicted views about homosexuality. But then he noted how online censorship has also spiked ahead of important state holidays and following unexpected events like the death of the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.\n\n“It’s still going on,” he said, “and it’s getting worse.”\n\nIn June, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television announced a new rating system for online bookstores and publishers based on criteria that included upholding moral values.\n\nThe powerful Cyberspace Administration — the ultimate authority over what is online in China — also shut down dozens of blogs and social media accounts for covering celebrity news and gossip that month.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Critics said the regulation appeared to contradict the government’s own position on homosexuality, which it decriminalized in 1997 and removed from an official list of mental disorders in 2001.\n\nChina’s censorship agencies exercise overlapping jurisdiction over the internet and often employ policies that create confusion. The result has been a layered system of control that begins with self-censorship by those who create online content, followed by policing by web platforms, which are often private enterprises, and finally, when necessary, intervention by government regulators or the police.\n\nSome regulations are explicit — no depiction of killing endangered species or underage drinking, for example. Others are imprecise. One, for example, prohibits blurring the lines between “truth and falsity, good and evil, beauty and ugliness.”\n\nCritics say the rules are meant to be so vague that the authorities can justify blocking anything, as circumstances dictate.\n\n“The tightening of content censorship is the general trend, but for content creators, they never know where exactly the lines lie,” said Gao Ming, who until recently produced a satirical podcast on current affairs called Radio HiLight.\n\nLike others, Mr. Gao acknowledged softening his commentaries to avoid trouble, trying to work around, or one step ahead of, the censors. For profit or in pursuit of art, many performers and producers have learn to live with the party’s limitations.\n\nMs. Song, the writer, works mostly in a literary genre known as danmei that has become hugely popular among young women. Taking its inspiration from Japanese stories and manga, it typically involves homoerotic romances. Ms. Song’s work is often serialized, with readers paying for new chapters as they are posted on one of the biggest publishing sites, Jinjiang Literature City.\n\n“If I want to publish it,” she said of her work, “then I need to follow the rules.”\n\nMs. Song, who lives in Wuhan, an enormous city in central China, said some of her chapters have been blocked because “sensitive keywords appeared in high frequency.” Usually, she then edits enough of those words out to get her writing past the censors and to her readers.\n\nMs. Song said she was not particularly worried about the new regulations. “Authors cannot use their works to encourage or incite criminal acts, especially among younger readers,” she said. “Literature, after all, has a guiding effect.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/world/asia/china-internet-censorship.html","1506225600.0"
"A Twitter user claims to have made the ‘swatting’ call that led police to kill a man\nA professional “swatter” — someone who pranks armed police into raiding the homes of innocent people — has claimed responsibility for placing a fake 911 call that led an officer to kill a man in Wichita.\n\nPolice were lured to the home of Andrew Finch, 28, on Thursday evening by a caller who falsely claimed to be inside with hostages and a gun.\n\nKnowing nothing of the report, Finch went to the door as officers surrounded his home and was fatally shot on his porch.\n\nIn tweets and interviews, a man known online as “Swautistic” said he had placed the 911 call — which in his view was a routine hoax gone badly wrong.\n\n“Bomb threats are more fun and cooler than swats in my opinion and I should have just stuck to that,” Swautistic told reporter Brian Krebs on Friday. “But I began making $ doing some swat requests.”\n\nSeveral hours later, Los Angeles police arrested a 25-year-old named Tyler Barriss in connection with Finch’s death. According to KABC, he had been arrested two years earlier for making hoax bomb threats to their TV station.\n\n[A police officer fatally shot a man while responding to an emergency call now called a ‘swatting’ prank]\n\nPolice have not said whether Barriss and Swautistic are the same person, or said who called them to the house, or why. But local reports suggest that Finch — a father of two — may have been randomly caught up in a feud between two videogamers who obtained his address.\n\nThe two unnamed gamers got into an argument over a match of Call of Duty on Thursday, according to the Wichita Eagle. Screenshots of the spat show that one of them dared the other to swat him — and for some reason gave out Finch’s address.\n\nSwatting usually makes the news when police are tricked into raiding the home of a celebrity — like Justin Bieber in 2012 or Lil Wayne in 2015. But it’s lately become a way for people to escalate online disputes into the real world — punishing a rival with a surprise visit from a SWAT team.\n\nSwautistic, as his screen name suggests, billed himself as something of a specialist.\n\n“According to him, he’s put his shingle out there as someone who can be hired to make these false reports,” said Krebs, a former Washington Post reporter who now investigates digital security issues. “It seems like he got some kind of pleasure from doing it.”\n\nThis may be how the aggrieved Call of Duty player came to enlist Swautistic’s services.\n\n[Professor who tweeted, ‘All I want for Christmas is white genocide,’ resigns after year of threats]\n\n“I was minding my own business at the library,” a man claiming to be Swautistic told the YouTube channel DramaAlert. “Someone contacted me and said, ‘Hey dude, this f—ing r—-d just gave me his address and he thinks nothing is going to happen. You want to prove him wrong?’ I said, ‘Sure, I love swatting kids who think that nothing’s going to happen.’ ”\n\nOn Thursday evening, a man phoned Wichita City Hall and ended up speaking with a 911 dispatcher. He said he had accidentally shot his father in the head during an argument and was now pointing a handgun at his mother and brother.\n\nHe threatened to set the house on fire, and then asked the operator: “Do you have my address correct?”\n\nPolice said the man continued to call 911 — even after they’d arrived at the address.\n\nAbout an hour after sunset, officers surrounded the two-story house on McCormick Street where Finch was at home with his mother and at least two other people — none of them hostages.\n\n“I had seen the red and blue light flashing in my window,” Lisa Finch told the Eagle. “I heard my son scream, I got up and then I heard a shot … They didn’t call the ambulance until he was dead.”\n\nFinch was one of nearly 1,000 people shot and killed by U.S. police in 2017, according to The Post’s running tally. Historically, few officers are charged and even fewer convicted.\n\nWithout naming him, police later said that a man emerged from the house and was repeatedly ordered to put his hands up. An officer thought he saw the man reach for a weapon, and opened fire.\n\nBut the man had no weapon, and police soon realized there were no victims in the house.\n\nAt a news conference, a deputy police chief said the officer who fired his gun had been placed on paid leave, and he blamed Finch’s death on “the actions of a prankster.”\n\nLisa Finch questioned how police could have been so easily duped. Her son didn’t even play video games, she told the Eagle. “He has better things to do with his time.”\n\n\n\nLisa Finch reacts to the killing of her son Andrew Finch after he was shot Thursday by police in Wichita. (Bo Rader/Wichita Eagle, via AP)\n\nAs reporters crowded around Finch’s blood-spattered porch on Thursday, @SWAuTistic wrote to 18,000 Twitter followers:\n\n“That kids house that I swatted is on the news.”\n\nHe wrote another message defending himself, according to the Eagle:\n\n“I DIDNT GET ANYONE KILLED BECAUSE I DIDNT DISCHARGE A WEAPON AND BEING A SWAT MEMBER ISNT MY PROFESSION.”\n\nSwautistic’s main account subsequently disappeared from Twitter — suspended — but by then, Krebs and others were digging through archives and screenshots of his posts.\n\n“Those tweets indicate that Swautistic is a serial swatter,” Krebs wrote on his website. He had claimed responsibility not just for Wichita — but for false bomb hoaxes at the Federal Communications Commission, a convention center in Dallas and a high school in Panama City, Fla.\n\nA man Krebs believes to be Swautistic contacted him on Twitter on Friday morning through an alternate Twitter account. “I didn’t believe him at first,” Krebs told The Post. “But he was able to prove he was the swatter.”\n\nKrebs asked Swautistic if he felt bad about Finch’s death.\n\n“Of course I do,” he replied. But he blamed the shooting on police and the Call of Duty player who had given him Finch’s address — “taunting me to swat.”\n\n“People will eventually . . . tell me to turn myself in or something,” he wrote. “I can’t do that; though I know its morally right. I’m too scared admittedly.”\n\n“All so stupid,” he wrote by way of reflection. “This whole thing.”\n\nWichita Police Department officials have also confirmed the arrest of Barriss in the fatal 'swatting' incident Thursday. The department said it is working with the LAPD and the FBI on this case pic.twitter.com/bSSGMTrpDL — KSN News Wichita (@KSNNews) December 30, 2017\n\nA few hours after Krebs interviewed Swautistic on Friday, Los Angeles police arrested Tyler R. Barriss. Wichita police confirmed that he is a suspect in the case, though spokesman Paul Cruz said he didn’t know how or if Barriss is connected to Swautistic or other online personas.\n\nHe has been arrested at least twice before, according to county records — once earlier this year for unknown reasons, and once in 2015, when he called a phony bomb threat in to the ABC affiliate in Glendale, the station reported.\n\nReporters had to broadcast the evening news while bomb-sniffing dogs traipsed through their building that day, KABC reported, and Barriss received a two-year sentence.\n\nThe FBI is now involved in the Wichita case, according to police.\n\nThis story has been updated.

"North Korea's missile launch shows program is speeding up, experts say\nNorth Korea's missile program is evolving, experts say, as the country develops and produces missiles at a faster rate, and deploys them in ways which potentially help evade new and existing defenses.\n\n'They did a launch a month ago, they're now launching (more) in 30 days, that's a third of the time they used to need,' Carl Schuster, Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center told CNN.\n\nOn Monday, North Korea launched four intermediate-range missiles into the Sea of Japan , also known as the East Sea, three of which landed within 200 nautical miles of Japan's coastline and the country's Japan's exclusive economic zone.\n\nIt came less than a month after North Korea launched the Pukguksong-2,a new type of missile which uses solid rocket fuel which allows for faster fueling before launch\n\nJust over five months earlier, they fired three missiles more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) into Japan's air defense zone\n\n'There's two ways to look at it -- one, they're quicker at doing the (launch) set up (and) they're quicker at making the missiles and transporting them,' Schuster said.\n\n'Keep in mind if they're doing a test shot you want to keep some (missiles) in reserve in case you go to war, so you're shooting a missile that is operationally spare. That means their missile stockpiles are larger than they were before.'\n\nCan North Korea overwhelm THAAD?\n\nNot only is North Korea producing more missiles, their techniques are getting more advanced.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, adjunct professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, told CNN these launches were, in fact, North Korea's way of signaling that they're not testing missiles anymore.\n\n'They're testing the units that fire the missiles. Can you fire them all at once to overwhelm a missile defense?' he said.\n\n'This is the sort of behavior you see from a state that is planning to deploy nuclear weapons to its military units. That's a change that's important.'\n\nNorth Korea announced last September it had successfully detonated a nuclear warhead capable of being mounted on ballistic missiles, however some analysts doubt that claim.\n\nRecent missile tests come as South Korea pushes to deploy a US-made THAAD missile defense system as a deterrent to any North Korean launches.\n\nLewis said multiple missiles fired simultaneously could be a technique to avoid THAAD, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. 'That's a basic missile defense countermeasure,' he said.\n\n'It's just harder for something like THAAD to deal with four targets at once rather than one. If you plan to use a nuclear missile on a target in South Korea, you want to fire them all at the same time.'\n\nWarning against South Korea drills\n\nMost experts said North Korea's missile launch on Monday was in retaliation for the start of South Korea's annual military drills with the United States on March 1, also known as Foal Eagle.\n\n'North Korea was looking for them to be scaled down somewhat so this maybe some way of expressing their discontent and warning the US and South Koreans that they are not going to tolerate being pushed around by large intimidating exercises,' Josh Pollack, editor of the Nonproliferation Review told CNN.\n\nLewis said North Korea was demonstrating that any US or South Korean invasion would be met with nuclear force.\n\n'The fact that they programmed against the US exercises is a message that now that they have nuclear weapons, on the first day of (a) war, they're not going to sit. They're going to use them,' he said.\n\nLaunch likely to infuriate China\n\nThe launch comes as China, North Korea's closest international ally, convenes its annual National People's Congress in Beijing.\n\nJUST WATCHED China cuts coal imports from North Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China cuts coal imports from North Korea 01:45\n\n'They won't be happy,' Pollack said. '(North Korea) wants to signal they do not feel the need to provide formal warning to the Chinese and show deference to them anymore (although) they may be doing it in private.'\n\nIt is just the latest example of Pyongyang antagonizing Beijing in the past six months.\n\nIn September, during China's big international moment at the G20 in Hangzhou, North Korea fired three missiles into the Sea of Japan\n\nIn February, North Korean agents were accused of murdering the exiled half-brother of Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Nam, who was widely considered to be under China's protection . North Korea denies any involvement.\n\n'They don't care (about China),' Lewis said. 'There's always been a kind of relationship of coercion or bullying (between the two) ... It's fairly standard for North Korea to find that infuriating.'","https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-analysis/index.html","1488776400.0"
"Malta car bomb kills Panama Papers journalist\nDaphne Caruana Galizia, a blogger whose investigations focused on corruption, was described as a ‘one-woman WikiLeaks’\n\nThe journalist who led the Panama Papers investigation into corruption in Malta was killed on Monday in a car bomb near her home.\n\nDaphne Caruana Galizia died on Monday afternoon when her car, a Peugeot 108, was destroyed by a powerful explosive device which blew the vehicle into several pieces and threw the debris into a nearby field.\n\nMurdered Panama Papers journalist's son attacks Malta's 'crooks' Read more\n\nA blogger whose posts often attracted more readers than the combined circulation of the country’s newspapers, Caruana Galizia was recently described by the Politico website as a “one-woman WikiLeaks”. Her blogs were a thorn in the side of both the establishment and underworld figures that hold sway in Europe’s smallest member state.\n\nHer most recent revelations pointed the finger at Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and two of his closest aides, connecting offshore companies linked to the three men with the sale of Maltese passports and payments from the government of Azerbaijan.\n\nNo group or individual has come forward to claim responsibility for the attack.\n\n\n\nMalta’s president, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, called for calm. “In these moments, when the country is shocked by such a vicious attack, I call on everyone to measure their words, to not pass judgment and to show solidarity,” she said.\n\nAfter a fraught general election this summer, commentators had been fearing a return to the political violence that scarred Malta during the 1980s.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Muscat condemned the “barbaric attack”, saying he had asked police to reach out to other countries’ security services for help identifying the perpetrators.\n\n“Everyone knows Ms Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine,” said Muscat at a hastily convened press conference, “both politically and personally, but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way”.\n\nMuscat announced later in parliament that FBI officers were on their way to Malta to assist with the investigation, following his request for outside help from the US government.\n\nThe Nationalist party leader, Adrian Delia – himself the subject of negative stories by Caruana Galizia – claimed the killing was linked to her reporting. “A political murder took place today,” Delia said in a statement. “What happened today is not an ordinary killing. It is a consequence of the total collapse of the rule of law which has been going on for the past four years.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Forensic experts walk in a field after a powerful bomb blew up a car killing investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters\n\nAccording to local media reports, Caruana Galizia filed a police report 15 days ago to say that she had been receiving death threats.\n\nThe journalist posted her final blog on her Running Commentary website at 2.35pm on Monday, and the explosion, which occurred near her home, was reported to police just after 3pm. Officers said her body had not yet been identified. According to sources, one of her sons heard the blast from their home and rushed out to the scene.\n\nCaruana Galizia, who claimed to have no political affiliations, set her sights on a wide range of targets, from banks facilitating money laundering to links between Malta’s online gaming industry and the Mafia.\n\nWhat are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak Read more\n\nOver the last two years, her reporting had largely focused on revelations from the Panama Papers, a cache of 11.5m documents leaked from the internal database of the world’s fourth largest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca.\n\n\n\nThe data was obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with media partners around the world, including the Guardian, by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington.\n\n\n\nCaruana Galizia’s son, Matthew Caruana Galizia, is a journalist and programmer who works for the ICIJ.\n\n\n\nHer family have filed a court application demanding a change of inquiring magistrate. Investigations into the case are being led by Consuelo Scerri Herrera, the magistrate who was on duty at the time. But Herrera had come under criticism by Galizia in her blog. The family’s petition states that they “have no trust” in Scerri Herrera and “do not believe that she can conduct a magisterial inquiry through the seriousness and impartiality that is needed in the search for truth”.\n\nEarlier this year, during Malta’s presidency of the European Union, her revelations caused major concern in Brussels.\n\n\n\nMEPs openly called for Muscat’s departure amid a growing scandal involving his wife, a Panamanian shell company and alleged payments from the president of Azerbaijan’s daughter.\n\nMuscat, who has been premier since 2013, went to the polls a year early after his wife was implicated in the scandal. He has always denied any wrongdoing and promised to quit if any evidence emerges of his family having secret offshore bank accounts used to stash kickbacks – as Caruana Galizia had alleged.\n\nResponding to news of the attack, the German MEP Sven Giegold, a leading figure in the parliament’s Panama Papers inquiry, said he was “shocked and saddened”.\n\n“It is too early to know the cause of the explosion but we expect to see a thorough investigation,” said Giegold. “Such incidents bring to mind Putin’s Russia, not the European Union. There can be absolutely no tolerance for violence against the press and violations of the freedom of expression in the European Union.”\n\nOpposition politicians claim rule of law has been under threat since Muscat returned Malta’s Labour party to power in 2013 following a long period in opposition. Four police commissioners have resigned under his leadership. The fifth, Lawrence Cutajar, took up his post in August 2016.\n\nThere have been several car bomb killings in Malta during recent years. While the perpetrators have not been identified, the violence is thought to have been linked to disputes between criminal gangs. None are thought to have been politically motivated.\n\nCaruana Galizia was 53 and leaves a husband and three sons.","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/malta-car-bomb-kills-panama-papers-journalist","1508126400.0"
"Exclusive: State Department tells refugee agencies to downsize U.S. operations\n(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has told refugee agencies it will sharply pare back the number of offices across the country authorized to resettle people in 2018 as President Donald Trump cuts the number of refugees allowed into the United States.\n\nThe announcement was made at a Dec. 1 meeting in Washington with State Department officials and representatives from nine major refugee agencies, several executives of the agencies said.\n\nAdvocates said the decision is likely to lead to the closure of dozens of resettlement offices around the country, potentially leaving some refugees without access to services that help them integrate into American life. Several state refugee coordinators said they had also been made aware of the closures.\n\nRefugee resettlement in the United States is handled by nine non-profit agencies that receive funding from the federal government for some of their refugee work. They partner with, or oversee, hundreds of local offices in nearly every state that help new arrivals with basic tasks like enrolling children in school, arranging doctors’ visits and applying for Social Security cards and other documents.\n\nThough the agencies are independent, they must get government approval for where they will resettle new refugees.\n\nAid workers and state officials involved in refugee resettlement said the agencies were informed by the State Department in the Dec. 1 meeting that offices expected to handle fewer than 100 refugees in fiscal year 2018 will no longer be authorized to resettle new arrivals, which means many of them will have to close. There are about 300 resettlement offices spread across 49 states, and advocates estimate several dozen are at risk, though shuttering plans will not be finalized until next year.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it wants refugees to assimilate quickly, both to promote national security and so that they can become self-sufficient.\n\nRefugee advocates say the closure of local offices will undermine that goal. They say the offices play a crucial role in helping newcomers traumatized from having fled conflict or persecution. Even if no new refugees are resettled by the offices they still have an obligation to help those already here, they say.\n\nIf refugees lose access to “services to help them navigate the processes of registering for school, and English classes and finding a job, that will mean that it will take longer for them to navigate life in the United States and contribute to our economy,” said Robert Carey, who directed the Office of Refugee Resettlement under former President Barack Obama.\n\nA State Department official confirmed the Dec. 1 meeting and said the agency is looking to “reduce costs and simplify management structures to help the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program run in a way that is fiscally responsible and sustainable.”\n\nSome conservative groups that favor lower immigration said they would welcome curbs on the agencies’ activities.\n\n“These organizations have to adapt when their services are no longer needed as much,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies. “There is no reason to keep funneling money to them.”\n\nJoshua Meservey, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation who formerly worked in refugee resettlement, said that costs need to be balanced against benefits. “It is unclear to me if the assimilation gains are great enough to justify the extra expense” of funding the smaller agencies, he said.\n\n‘WE’VE LOST A REALLY VALUABLE PARTNER’\n\nThe nine agencies are now trying to coordinate closures so that they can maintain at least one resettlement agency in as many states as possible, several agency executives said.\n\n“We’re hoping that they (the State Department) only close sites where there is possible duplication,” said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, one of the nine agencies. “This is going to have to be a negotiation and a process.”\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has moved to sharply reduce refugee admissions to the United States, because of national security concerns and a belief that money could be better spent resettling people closer to their original homes.\n\nSoon after taking office, he slashed the 2017 U.S. refugee cap to 50,000 from the 110,000 ceiling set by Obama. In September, he announced a cap of 45,000 for 2018, the lowest number since the modern U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.\n\nThe resettlement office in Chattanooga, Tennessee is at risk of shutting down, because it is only projected to receive about 85 refugees, said Holly Johnson, the state’s refugee coordinator.\n\n“Small doesn’t necessarily mean weak or subpar,” Johnson said. “They spend more time with folks, they have really well-established connections to the community, so people feel welcomed, which really helps.”\n\nUntil this year, Idaho had four resettlement offices - three in Boise and one in Twin Falls, said Jan Reeves, director of the Idaho Office for Refugees, a non-profit which administers resettlement in the state. Earlier this year one of the sites in Boise shut down, he said.\n\n“It was disruptive, and we’ve lost a really valuable partner and we’ve lost some capacity to do the job,” he said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Retired engineer John Wider, 59, is greeted by a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump as he holds up a sign reading 'Welcome Refugees' at the international arrivals terminal at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, U.S. on June 29, 2017.

"Navy pilot recalls encounter with UFO: 'I think it was not from this world'\nRetired Cmdr. David Fravor spent 18 years as a Navy pilot, but nothing prepared him for what he witnessed during a routine training mission on Nov. 14, 2004.\n\n'I can tell you, I think it was not from this world,' Fravor told ABC News. 'I'm not crazy, haven't been drinking. It was — after 18 years of flying, I've seen pretty much about everything that I can see in that realm, and this was nothing close.'\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nFravor's stunning retelling of his encounter off the California coast with what appeared to be a 40-foot-long wingless object that flew at incredible speeds in an erratic pattern comes as the Pentagon revealed the existence of a secret program to investigate sightings of UFOs.\n\nThe program was shut down in 2012 because of other budget priorities, according to the Pentagon.\n\n'I have never seen anything in my life, in my history of flying that has the performance, the acceleration — keep in mind this thing had no wings,' Fravor said.\n\nHe recalled flying his F/A-18 fighter on a training mission on a beautiful Southern California day 13 years ago when things started to get strange.\n\nControllers on one of the Navy ships on the water below reported objects that were dropping out of the sky from 80,000 feet and going 'straight back up,' Fravor said.\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\n'So we're thinking, OK, this is going to be interesting,' he said.\n\nAs they were looking around for the object that appeared on the radar, another aviator spotted something. 'I was like, 'Dude, do you see that?'' Fravor recalled saying.\n\n“We look down, we see a white disturbance in the water, like something's under the surface, and the waves are breaking over, but we see next to it, and it's flying around, and it's this little white Tic Tac, and it's moving around — left, right, forward, back, just random,' he said.\n\nThe object didn't display the rotor wash typical of a helicopter or jet wash from a plane, he said.\n\nThe planes flew lower to investigate the object, which started to mirror their movements before disappearing, Fravor said. 'As we start to cut across, it rapidly accelerates, climbs past our altitude and disappears,' Fravor recalled.\n\n'When it started to near us, as we started to descend towards it coming up, it was flying in the elongated way, so it's [like] a Tic Tac, with the roundish end going in the forward direction ... I don't know what it is. I don't know what I saw. I just know it was really impressive, really fast, and I would like to fly it,' he said.\n\nThe disturbance in the water also vanished with object, he remembered.\n\n'So we turned around — we couldn't have been more than about a couple miles away — and there's no white water at all in the ocean,' Fravor said. 'It's just blue.'\n\nAt that point, they decided to return to complete the training exercise when they were told the object or something similar reappeared.\n\n'And the controller comes up and says, 'Sir, you're not going to believe this. That thing is at your half point,' which is our hold point,' Fravor added. 'And I'm like, 'Oh, great.''\n\nAnother plane that launched from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz around the same time had its radar jammed and was able to pick up the object on an infrared channel.\n\n'He gets close enough to see a couple of objects come out of the bottom, and then all of a sudden it takes off and goes right off the side of the screen and, like, takes off,' Fravor said.\n\nHe recalled that the speed of the object, which he said had no exhaust trail in infrared scanning, was stunning.\n\n'No aircraft that we know of can fly at those speeds, maneuver like that and looks like that,' ABC News contributor and former Marine Col. Stephen Ganyard said.\n\nFravor said there is no rational explanation for what they saw that day.\n\n'I don't know if it was alien life, but I will say that in an infinite universe, with multiple galaxies that we know of, that if we're the only planet with life, it's a pretty lonely universe.'\n\nThere was no further investigation into the incident, he said.\n\n'You know, you see a lot of interesting things,' Fravor said. 'But to show up on something that's a 40-foot-long white Tic Tac with no wings that can move, really, in any random direction that it wants and go from hovering over the ocean to mirroring us to accelerating to the point where it just disappears — like, poof, then it was gone.'","http://abcnews.go.com/US/navy-pilot-recalls-encounter-ufo-unlike/story?id=51856514","None"
"Saudi Arabia Agrees to Let Women Drive\nSaudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holiest sites, is an absolute monarchy ruled according to Shariah law. Saudi officials and clerics have provided numerous explanations for the ban over the years.\n\nSome said that it was inappropriate in Saudi culture for women to drive, or that male drivers would not know how to handle having women in cars next to them. Others argued that allowing women to drive would lead to promiscuity and the collapse of the Saudi family. One cleric claimed — with no evidence — that driving harmed women’s ovaries.\n\nRights groups and Saudi activists have long campaigned for the ban to be overturned, and some women have been arrested and jailed for defying the prohibition and taking the wheel.\n\nIn 2014, Loujain Hathloul was arrested after trying to cross the border from the United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia and detained for 73 days.\n\n“@LoujainHathloul I’m so proud of you,” Fahad Albuteiri, her husband and a well-known Saudi comedian, wrote on Twitter.\n\nMs. Hathloul tweeted a simple reaction to the news: “Thank god.”\n\nThe ban has long marred the image of Saudi Arabia, even among its closest allies, like the United States, whose officials sometimes chafed at a policy shared only by the jihadists of the Islamic State and the Taliban.\n\n\n\nThe decision won near universal praise in Washington. Heather Nauert, the State Department’s spokeswoman, called it “a great step in the right direction for that country.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe momentum to change the policy picked up in recent years with the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the king’s 32-year-old son, who has laid out a far-reaching plan to overhaul the kingdom’s economy and society.\n\nIncreasing numbers of women are working in a growing number of professions, and in 2015, women were allowed to vote and to run for seats on the kingdom’s local councils.\n\nEnding the ban on women driving is expected to face some resistance inside the kingdom, where families are highly patriarchal and some men say they worry about their female relatives getting stranded should their cars break down.\n\nBut in a small news conference at the Saudi embassy in Washington, an exuberant Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador, said women would be able to obtain driver’s licenses without having to ask permission of their husbands, fathers or any male guardian — despite so-called “guardianship” laws that give men power over their female relatives.\n\nVideo\n\nUnder these laws, women cannot travel abroad, work or undergo some medical procedures without the consent of their male “guardian,” often a father, a husband or even a son. While the enforcement of guardianship laws has loosened in recent years, there is little to stop Saudi men from greatly limiting the movements of their wives or daughters.\n\nThe ambassador, who is a son of the king, said that women would be able to drive alone but that the Interior Ministry would decide whether they could work as professional drivers.\n\nHe said he did not expect the change in policy to face significant resistance.\n\n“I think our society is ready,” he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many Saudis remain deeply conservative, and social strictures like the driving ban have been reinforced over the years by the kingdom’s top clerics, many of them on the government payroll.\n\nBut there was little public dissent on Tuesday, likely because the Saudi government often exerts pressure on prominent voices to make sure they either back the government line or keep quiet. In recent weeks it has arrested more than two dozens clerics, academics and others, accusing them of being foreign-funded dissidents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the change on the driving ban was announced, an anonymous text circulated through What’s App in the kingdom calling on the “virtuous ones” to work against its implementation, to protect against epidemics, adultery and other disasters.\n\nAt the news conference, the ambassador insisted that the decision would not be reversed or seriously opposed.\n\nBeyond the effects it could have on Saudi Arabia’s image abroad, letting women drive could help the Saudi economy.\n\nLow oil prices have limited the government jobs that many Saudis have long relied on, and the kingdom is trying to push more citizens, including women, into private sector employment. But some working Saudi women say hiring private drivers to get them to and from work eats up much of their pay, diminishing the incentive to work.\n\nIn recent years, many women have come to rely on ride-sharing apps like Uber and Careem to gain some freedom of movement.\n\nMany of the kingdom’s professionals and young people will welcome the change, viewing it as a step to making life in the country a bit more like life elsewhere.\n\nManal al-Sharif, a Saudi women’s rights advocate who filmed herself driving in 2011 and posted the footage to YouTube to protest the law, celebrated the announcement on Tuesday.\n\nMs. Sharif was instrumental in organizing groups of women for collective protests to demand an end to the ban on female drivers. She was arrested at the time for taking part in the actions, and later wrote a book about her experience. She now lives in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut despite celebrating the success for female drivers, she said the next campaign would be to end guardianship laws.\n\nThe royal decree, read by an announcer of state television and signed by King Salman, said traffic laws would be amended, including to allow the government to issue driver’s licenses “to men and women alike.”\n\nThe decree said a high-level ministerial committee was being formed to study other issues that needed to be addressed for the change to take place. For example, the police will have to be trained to interact with women in a way that they rarely do in Saudi Arabia, a society where men and women who are not related have little contact.\n\nThe committee has 30 days to provide its recommendations, the decree said, so that the new policy can be carried out starting on June 24, 2018.\n\nThe decree said that the majority of the Council of Senior Scholars — the kingdom’s top clerical body, whose members are appointed by the king — had agreed that the government could allow women to drive if done in accordance with Shariah law.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-drive.html","1506398400.0"
"Feds interviewed accused NYC truck attacker in 2015 about possible terror ties\nSayfullo Saipov, who has been charged with killing eight people in a vehicle attack on the West Side of Manhattan on Tuesday, was interviewed in 2015 by federal agents about possible ties to suspected terrorists but a case was never opened against him, law enforcement officials tell ABC News.\n\nInterested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSaipov was listed as a “point of contact” for two men whose were listed in a Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism database and later overstayed their tourist visas, a federal official told ABC News. One was flagged after arriving from a so-called “threat country,” while the other vanished and was being actively sought by federal agents as a “suspected terrorist.” An official told ABC News that the FBI has since located him and he is not believed to have been involved in Tuesday’s attack.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, President Donald Trump noted that Saipov had served as the “point of contact” for 23 people. A source confirmed that number to ABC News but said it is unclear if those people are 'immediate family members, distant family members, or friends.” Only those two men, however, were listed in the database.\n\nSt. Charles County Dept. of Corrections via AFP/Getty Images\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesman said that its law enforcement agencies -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations -- 'did not interview Saipov in 2015.'\n\nSaipov, 29, is originally from Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan. A former neighbor of Saipov’s in Tashkent, who did not want to be identified, told ABC News today that she remembers Saipov’s family as modest and secular and described Saipov as “a normal young man” when he lived there.\n\n“The family was normal, modern, wearing tight pants, no scarfs,” she said. “They did not go to the mosque.”\n\nAccording to a statement released by Uzbekistan's embassy in Washington, Saipov graduated from college, worked as an accountant for a hotel and had no previous criminal record while living in Tashkent.\n\n“Neighbors in makhalla (local community in Uzbekistan) described Saipov quite positively: according to them, he did not provoke any suspicions, always kept a low profile and used to be friendly in relation with others,” the statement reads. “He was brought up in a good family environment. His parents preached traditional Islam and have never been noticed in communications with any extremist groups.”\n\nABC News\n\nHe entered the United States through a Diversity Visa Program lottery in 2010, making him a legal permanent resident of the United States upon arrival. He has lived in Ohio, Florida and, most recently, Paterson, N.J. with his wife, Nozima, and three children, who were escorted from the residence by the FBI as federal agents and evidence technicians were gathering evidence on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, Trump took aim at the program that allowed Saipov to gain entry to the country on Twitter, calling it a “Chuck Schumer beauty” and vowing to replace it with “merit based immigration,” but the accused attacker appears to have been radicalized from within the United States\n\nAuthorities say Saipov, who was shot by police following the attack, told them from his hospital bed that he was proud of what he had done. Investigators searching Saipov’s online activities have found social media links to people who are or were subjects of terror investigations. And authorities say Saipov claimed in a handwritten note found near his truck that he carried out Tuesday’s attack on behalf of the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS.\n\nSeth Wenig/AP\n\nThe terror group has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but according to Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the online activity of jihadist organizations, the attack “fits [the] style” of recent suspected ISIS-inspired attack throughout Europe.\n\n“Amid losses in #Iraq and #Syria, #ISIS has ramped up calls for supporters to perform attacks in the #US, among other Western nations,” Katz wrote in multiple posts on Twitter in the wake of the attack in New York City. “#ISIS media regularly pushes #NYC attacks … #ISIS supporters celebrating #Manhattan attack.”\n\nAccording to Matthew Olsen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center and an ABC News contributor, the “biggest threat we face right now in this country” isn’t the people who cross our borders but the propaganda.\n\n“The pattern we're seeing now is not people coming here with a plan to carry out an attack,” Olsen said. “It's either people here in the United States, born here as citizens or here as visitors, who have become radicalized by online propaganda from ISIS.”\n\nABC News’ Ben Gittelson and Patrick Reevell contributed to this report.","http://abcnews.go.com/US/feds-interviewed-suspected-nyc-truck-attacker-2015-terror/story?id=50859185","None"
"OPEC, Russia agree oil cut extension to end of 2018\nVIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signaling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.\n\nRussia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market doesn’t flip into a deficit too soon, prices don’t rally too fast and rival U.S.\n\nshale firms don’t boost output further.\n\nRussia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.\n\nThe producers’ current deal, under which they are cutting supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to boost oil prices, expires in March.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies had agreed to extend the cuts by nine months until the end of 2018, as largely anticipated by the market.\n\nOPEC also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels below 2.8 million bpd. Both countries have been exempt from cuts due to unrest and lower-than-normal production.\n\nFalih said it was premature to talk about exiting the cuts at least for a couple of quarters as the world was entering a season of low winter demand. He added that OPEC would examine progress at its next regular meeting in June.\n\n“When we get to an exit, we are going to do it very gradually ... to make sure we don’t shock the market,” he said.\n\nOPEC and Russia together produce over 40 percent of global oil. Moscow’s first real cooperation with OPEC, put together with the help of President Vladimir Putin, has been crucial in roughly halving an excess of global oil stocks since January.\n\nWith oil prices rising above $60, Russia has expressed concerns that an extension for the whole of 2018 could prompt a spike in crude production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal.\n\nA joint OPEC and non-OPEC communique said the next meeting in June 2018 would present an opportunity to adjust the agreement based on market conditions.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nThe Iraqi, Iranian and Angolan oil ministers also said before Thursday’s meetings that a review of the deal was possible in June in case the market became too tight.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 rose around 0.5 percent on Thursday to trade above $63 per barrel.\n\nGLUT OR SHORTAGE?\n\nJust as OPEC gathered in Vienna, U.S. government data showed that U.S. oil production rose 3 percent in September to 9.48 million bpd. But Falih said OPEC “won’t be quick on the trigger” to react to short-term U.S. output spikes.\n\nU.S. shale oil producers, which effectively triggered the global oil glut of recent years, have been adjusting their message over the past year, switching away from combative language with regard to OPEC actions.\n\n“If producers in the U.S. increase their rig count over the next few months due to higher prices then I expect another price collapse by the end of 2018,” said Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N), one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield.\n\n“I hope that all U.S. shale companies will maintain their current rig counts and use all excess cash flow to increase dividends back to their shareholders,” he told Reuters.\n\nGary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of Pira consultancy, said the market could surprise on the upside with Brent rising to $70 if there were a major supply disruption.\n\n“Everywhere you look there is an ever-present risk to supply,” Ross said.\n\n“In Iraq’s Kurdistan there is a major risk to oil exports because of tensions with Baghdad, in Libya militias are still fighting, in Nigeria the risks of disruptions are significant, Venezuela is on the verge of default, Iran could again face U.S. financial sanctions and even in Saudi Arabia political risk is on the rise,” Ross added.\n\nThe production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC.\n\nRussia has signaled it wants to understand better how producers will exit from the cuts as it needs to provide guidance to its private and state energy companies. On Thursday, Novak said all companies were on board with the latest limits.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-meeting/opec-russia-agree-oil-cut-extension-to-end-of-2018-idUSKBN1DU0WW","1512086940.0"
"FCC Unveils Plan To Repeal Net Neutrality Rules\nFCC Unveils Plan To Repeal Net Neutrality Rules\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nFederal regulators are on track to loosen regulations of cable and telecom companies.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission will vote Dec. 14 on a plan to undo the landmark 2015 rules that had placed Internet service providers like Comcast and Verizon under the strictest-ever regulatory oversight.\n\nThe vote is expected to repeal so-called net neutrality rules, which prevent broadband companies from slowing down or blocking any sites or apps, or otherwise deciding what content gets to users faster.\n\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday said his repeal proposal would 'stop micromanaging the Internet.' Instead his plan would require Internet providers to disclose what exactly they're doing – for example, whether they allow some websites or apps to pay extra for faster streaming.\n\nThis would essentially shift the enforcement of net neutrality to the Federal Trade Commission, which polices violators rather than pre-empts the violations in the first place.\n\nThe five-member FCC has a Republican majority, including Pai, suggesting that his plan — called 'The Restoring Internet Freedom Order' — will pass. As with various iterations of the rules over the past decade, the rules would likely face a lawsuit. The 2015 rules were the first version to be upheld in court in full.\n\nTelecom and cable companies have long argued that the FCC's attempts to regulate privacy and Internet behavior put them on an unequal footing with other Internet companies that collect data on users, like Google and Netflix, which are only overseen by the FTC.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that Pai's plan would put more power in the hands of Internet providers 'to dictate people's online experiences':\n\n'Under a repeal, companies like AT&T and Comcast may be able to charge people higher fees to access certain websites and online services. The companies may also be able to prioritize their own services while disadvantaging websites run by rivals.'\n\nPai — a free-market advocate who has staked his FCC chairmanship on deregulation — has argued that the FCC's 2015 rules have depressed companies' investments in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred them from coming up with new consumer-friendly business models.\n\nAs we've reported before, dozens of consumer advocacy groups including Fight for the Future, Demand Progress and the ACLU have supported the strong net neutrality rules — aligned with companies like Netflix, Google, Etsy, Vimeo, Reddit and Amazon.\n\n'We haven't actually lived in a world where fully the ISPs could block access,' Denelle Dixon, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, told NPR in the summer when Pai's plan began taking shape. 'This is the world we need to imagine now.'\n\nEditor's Note: NPR's legal counsel has filed comments with the FCC on the net neutrality proposal, in opposition to deregulation.

"4th US soldier killed in Niger ambush identified\nThe Pentagon has identified the fourth U.S. soldier killed in the West African nation of Niger earlier this week in an ambush believed to have been carried out by an Islamic extremist group.\n\nSgt. La David T. Johnson, 25, from Miami Gardens, Florida, was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Johnson had been initially listed as missing following Wednesday's ambush that took place in a remote area along Niger's border with Mali.\n\nHe was one of about a dozen U.S. Army soldiers conducting a joint patrol with about 40 soldiers from Niger when they came under attack by about 50 enemy fighters.\n\nIn addition to the three other U.S. soldiers killed along with Johnson, a soldier from Niger also died from the attack. Two other American soldiers were wounded in the ambush and were as of Friday receiving medical treatment at a U.S. Army hospital in Germany.\n\nJohnson's remains were recovered on Friday by soldiers from Niger near the site of the ambush after an intense search for the missing soldier by forces from the U.S., Niger and France.\n\nPrior to the discovery of Johnson's remains, U.S. Africa Command spokesman Col. Mark Cheadle said 'more than a hundred' U.S. military personnel, including special operations forces, had been sent to Niger to assist with a possible rescue operation in the event the missing soldier was being held captive.\n\nCheadle said the U.S. 'had an idea' of which Islamic extremist group may have been responsible for the attack.\n\n'We are resolved and stalwart in our efforts to go after those who attacked,' the spokesman said.\n\nVarious extremist groups operate along the Niger-Mali border area, including Ansar Dine, an al Qaeda-affiliated extremist group, and ISIS-West Africa.\n\nJohnson enlisted in the Army in January 2014 as a wheeled-vehicle mechanic and was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, a Green Beret unit.\n\nHis awards and decorations include the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Army Parachutist Badge, the Army Air Assault Badge, the Driver and Mechanic Badge, and the Marksmanship Qualification Badge - Sharpshooter with Rifle.\n\n'The Bush Hog formation [Johnson's battalion] was made better because of Johnson's faithful service and we are focused on caring for the Johnson family during this difficult period,' said Lt. Col. David Painter, commander of 2nd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne).\n\nThe three other U.S. Army soldiers killed in the attack were identified by the Pentagon on Friday. They all served with Special Operations Forces and were based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Two, including Johnson, were support personnel, and two were Green Berets.\n\nStaff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, died from wounds sustained during the ambush that occurred near Niger's border with Mali about 125 miles north of Niamey, Niger's capital.\n\nUS Army\n\nStaff Sgt. Bryan Black of Puyallup, Washington, who enlisted in the Army in October 2009, was a Green Beret serving as a Special Forces medical sergeant.

"Case of Missing Lebanese Prime Minister Stirs Middle East Tensions\nNow analysts and diplomats are scrambling to figure out what the latest developments mean, whether they are connected and whether, as some analysts fear, they are part of a buildup to a regional war.\n\nMr. Hariri, until he announced his resignation on Saturday, had shown no signs of planning to do so.\n\nHours later, on Saturday evening, a missile fired from Yemen came close to Riyadh before being shot down. Saudi Arabia later blamed Iran and Hezbollah for the missile, suggesting that they had aided the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen to fire it.\n\nBefore the world had a chance to absorb this news, the ambitious and aggressive Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the arrest of hundreds of Saudis — including 11 princes, government ministers and some of the kingdom’s most prominent businessmen — in what was either a crackdown on corruption, as Saudi officials put it, or a purge, as outside analysts have suggested.\n\nIt then emerged that on a visit to Riyadh the week before, Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, who has been sent on missions both to Israel and Saudi Arabia, had a previously undisclosed meeting with the crown prince, talking with him until the early morning hours. The White House has not announced what they discussed but officials privately said that they were meeting about the administration’s efforts to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi officials said they considered the missile from Yemen an act of war by Iran and Lebanon, and on Thursday the kingdom rattled Lebanon by ordering its citizens to evacuate.\n\nNo one expects Saudi Arabia, which is mired in a war in Yemen, to start another war itself. But Israel, which fought a war with Hezbollah in 2006, has expressed increasing concern about Hezbollah’s growing arsenal on its northern border.\n\nOn Friday, Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said that Saudi Arabia had asked Israel to attack Lebanon, after essentially kidnapping Mr. Hariri.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“I’m not talking here about analysis, but information,” he said. “The Saudis asked Israel to attack Lebanon.”\n\nHe provided no evidence of his claim, but Western and regional analysts have also said that, given all the confusing and unexpected events and unpredictable players, they could not entirely rule out such a scenario.\n\nIsraeli officials, however, have been publicly predicting another war with Hezbollah while also vowing to do all they can to postpone it.\n\n“There are now those in the region who would like Israel to go to war with Hezbollah and fight a Saudi war to the last Israeli,” said Ofer Zalzberg, a Jerusalem-based analyst for International Crisis Group. “There is no interest in that here.”\n\nPhoto\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long considered Iran to be Israel’s foremost enemy, a potential nuclear threat as well as a strategic adversary seeking to convert postwar Syria into a staging ground for attacks against Israel or into a corridor to transfer missiles and other weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nSo Saudi Arabia’s stepped-up efforts to oppose Iranian influence in Lebanon drew measured applause in Jerusalem. But many Israelis fear that the aggressive actions by the Saudi crown prince could drag Israel into a war that it does not want.\n\nDaniel Shapiro, a former United States ambassador to Israel, said that Israel and Saudi Arabia were pursuing similar goals at sharply different speeds and levels of proficiency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Prince Mohammed, he added, “seems very impatient to actually spark the confrontation.”\n\nThere are no signs of war preparations in Israel. The country is not mobilizing troops on its northern border or calling up reservists, and Mr. Netanyahu has given no indication that he sees a conflict as imminent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoreover, Israel’s war planners predict that the next war with Hezbollah may be catastrophic, particularly if it lasts more than a few days. Hezbollah now has more than 120,000 rockets and missiles, Israel estimates, enough to overwhelm Israeli missile defenses.\n\nMany of them are long-range and accurate enough to bring down Tel Aviv high-rises, sink offshore gas platforms, knock out Ben-Gurion Airport or level landmark buildings across Israel.\n\nNor is Hezbollah necessarily hankering for battle with Israel, according to analysts who study the militant group closely. It is still fighting in Syria, where it has been backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and it is being drained by medical costs for wounded fighters and survivor benefits for the families of those killed, said Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general and former head of the country’s National Security Council.\n\n“Hezbollah as an organization is in a very deep economic crisis today,” Mr. Eiland said. “But at the same time, the weaker they are, the more dependent they are on Iranian assistance — so they might have to comply with Iran’s instructions.”\n\nBut there have long been fears that now that the Syrian war — in which Hezbollah played a decisive role, gaining new influence, power and weapons — is almost over, Hezbollah’s enemies might seek to cut it down to size.\n\nMr. Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, implied Friday that its fight in Syria was nearly finished. If Saudi Arabia’s goal was to force Hezbollah to leave Syria, he said: “No problem. Our goal there has been achieved. It’s almost over anyway.”\n\nWorld leaders have sought to tamp down tensions.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France left Saudi Arabia on Friday after a brief, last-minute meeting with the crown prince.\n\nDuring the unexpected two-hour visit on Thursday, Mr. Macron “reiterated the importance France attaches to Lebanon’s stability, security, sovereignty and integrity,” his office said. He also discussed “the situation in Lebanon following the resignation of Prime Minister Hariri,” his office said, but provided no further details.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA group of countries and organizations interested in Lebanon’s stability met Friday with the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, and issued a statement expressing “concern regarding the situation and prevailing uncertainty in Lebanon” and calling for Lebanon to be “shielded from tensions in the region.”\n\nThe members of the group, the International Support Group for Lebanon — including the United Nations, Britain, China, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, as well as the European Union and the Arab League — are not all on the same side of the issues at stake so the statement seemed to reflect broad international concern.\n\nAt a news conference in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, before the meeting, Mr. Macron said he did not share Saudi Arabia’s “very harsh opinions” of Iran.\n\n\n\nAnalysts say a new war in the region is unlikely but some have warned that the increased tensions could provoke an economic crisis or even start a war accidentally. Miscalculations have started wars before, as in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nExperts caution that Israel is often only a mistake or two from being drawn into combat.\n\n“It’s a dangerous situation now,” said Amos Harel, the military reporter for Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper. “It only takes one provocation, another reaction, and it can get all of a sudden completely out of control. And when you add the Saudis, who evidently want to attack Iran and are looking for action, it gets even more complicated.”","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-lebanon-france-macron.html","1510290000.0"
"Two protesters killed in Iran as government blocks messaging app\n'Those who damage public property, disrupt order and break the law must be responsible for their behavior and pay the price,' Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told state television Sunday.\n\nLater Sunday, President Hassan Rouhani made his first statement since the unrest began, saying people have the right to protest but urging them to do so peacefully.\n\n'Criticism and protest is the people's right; it must solve the problems of the country and improve people's lives,' he said. 'It is different from violence and destruction of public property.'\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, whose travel bans blocked Iranians from getting U.S. visas, tweeted out his support for the protests Sunday morning after being rebuked by Iran's Foreign Ministry for similar comments on Saturday.\n\nBig protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017\n\nRouhani, in breaking his silence Sunday, also rebuffed Trump.\n\nRelated: Trump's 'America First' policy has isolated U.S. from world leaders\n\n'Government and people solve problems together. One who calls the Iranian nation a terrorist does not have the right of compassion for our people,' Rouhani said.\n\nHours later, Trump tweeted again, calling Iran 'the Number One State of Sponsored Terror' and criticizing the country for cutting off access to the Internet. 'Not good!' he said.\n\nIran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017\n\nIt's unclear what effect Trump's support for the protests would have. Iranians are already largely skeptical over his refusal to re-certify the 2015 nuclear deal, while Iran's government has often used comments by U.S. officials to dismiss protests as a sign of foreign interference in its internal politics.\n\n'The people of Iran give no value and credit to Trump,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said Saturday. 'The powerful people of Iran don't waste their time with opportunist and meddlesome slogans of American officials.'\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani at a cabinet meeting in Tehran on Sunday. Iranian Presidency handout / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThousands have taken to the streets across Iran, beginning on Thursday in Mashhad, the country's second-largest city and a holy site for Shiite pilgrims.\n\nWhat started out as a provincial demonstration over the economy appears to have quickly transformed into something more political, with slogans shifting from complaints about the prices of everyday goods to calls for the ruling establishment to be brought down.\n\nThe demonstrations spread to the capital, Tehran, on Saturday night, with hundreds of protesters gathering in various squares chanting slogans against the clerical elite and tearing down posters. Meanwhile, social media video appeared to show students inside Tehran University chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with police as they tried to exit the campus.\n\nEarlier Saturday, hard-liners rallied across the country to support Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and others in planned demonstrations of support for the regime.\n\nIranian students clash with riot police during an anti-government protest around Tehran University on Saturday. EPA\n\nIn the city of Doroud, in the west of the country, two protesters were killed at an unauthorized rally, said Habibollah Khojastepour, the security deputy of Iran's western Lorestan province. Municipal buildings and banks were also looted, and a police motorcycle was set alight.\n\nVideos on social media purported to show the protesters shot dead by government security forces. But Khojastepour denied that police fired the shots, blaming terrorists and foreign agents.\n\n'We have found evidence of enemies of the revolution ... and foreign agents in this clash,' he said on state television Sunday.\n\nNBC News could not verify the videos or details of the shooting.\n\nMany in Iran are learning about the protests and sharing images of them through Telegram, an app popular among the country's 80 million people. On Saturday, Telegram shut down one channel on the service over Iranian allegations that it encouraged violence.\n\nInternet connectivity has also been cut or slowed down dramatically, apparently in an attempt to stop activists from organizing gatherings or posting videos of demonstrations.\n\nThe price for public disorder in Iran can be very high. Protesters convicted during the 2009 election were handed down harsh sentences and heavy fines. Authorities said several people who were chanting anti-government slogans and damaging public property were arrested Saturday night in Tehran.\n\nWarnings that civil disobedience won't be tolerated and the fact that social media is being blocked suggests authorities may be preparing to crack down if people return to the streets Sunday evening.\n\nThere have nonetheless been calls for more protests, and if people do come out and the clampdown is indeed severe, it remains to be seen whether that would encourage protesters to dig in deeper or scare them off.\n\nThe next few days may therefore be critical in determining where this movement is headed, as many in Iran continue to try to understand it.\n\nWithin Iran's splintered political system, different factions held one another accountable for the unrest, with hard-liners blaming Rouhani and reformists blaming religious hard-liners. On both sides of the political divide, politicians and clerics said the people had legitimate concerns, but those same people are also saying the protest bears the hallmarks of seditionists and foreign enemies.\n\nDemonstrators protest against Iran's weak economy Saturday in Tehran. AP\n\nAlthough the protests are widespread, they seem to be smaller than those in 2009.\n\nUnlike the 2009 protests, the crowds aren't chanting the names of the leaders of the so-called green movement or wearing green bracelets in a display of support for reforms, something that had become commonplace in Iran in the years since. In fact, the activists, who appear more emboldened, radical and provocative than in the past, don't appear to be chanting for any leader.\n\nIt's expected that the longer the protests go on, the harder security forces will crack down. In many of the videos circulating on social media, the police appear, so far, to have mostly exercised restraint.\n\nThere has also been little evidence of the presence of the Revolutionary Guard, but that could change in the coming days.\n\nIran's economy has improved since Rouhani's government struck the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the end of some of the international sanctions that crippled its economy. Tehran now sells its oil on the global market and has signed deals for tens of billions of dollars of Western aircraft.\n\nThat improvement hasn't reached the average Iranian, however. Unemployment remains high. Official inflation has crept up to 10 percent again. A recent increase in egg and poultry prices, by as much as 40 percent, which a government spokesman has blamed on a cull over avian flu fears, appears to have been the spark for the protests.","https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/two-protesters-killed-iran-government-blocks-messaging-app-n833696","None"
"The healing, and persistent, power of kindness\nIn this season of Christmas, a question... When was the last time you thought about the power of KINDNESS? Our Cover Story is reported by Lee Cowan:\n\nThe wonderful thing about 'It's a Wonderful Life' is those final few minutes, when George Bailey -- after a lifetime of dolling out kindness -- finally gets it all back in full measure.\n\nSure, it's a Hollywood ending -- kindness rarely parades into your living room, after all -- but it can appear in places you don't expect.\n\nFor Traci Bild, it was the parking lot of a Dairy Queen some 30 years ago tonight.\n\n'My mom loves Christmas, we were very much about Christmas, but we just didn't have any money for a Christmas tree. That was just the reality,' she told Cowan.\n\nYes, on that Christmas Eve in Urbana, Ohio, there was no tree, no presents, no money … except for the few coins she and her brother scrounged out of the couch cushions.\n\n'It wasn't much,' Bild laughed. 'I mean, it was literally quarters and dimes. Probably under a dollar!'\n\nThey took their meager offering to the only tree lot in town, at that Dairy Queen, run by a round-faced man nicknamed 'Jug.'\n\nFamily photo\n\nJug had been a Marine and an Ohio State Trooper, and although stern-faced in old photos, on that night Jug seemed to Bild as soft as new-fallen snow. 'You know, the thought of my children, walking a couple of miles in hopes of finding on Christmas Eve a Christmas tree to take home to their mom, I can imagine that must have touched his heart,' she said.\n\nTouched, indeed; Jug not only gave them a tree, he gave them his biggest and best, no questions asked.\n\n'It was about the magic of Christmas, of human kindness, and somebody doing something for us that we did not expect someone to do,' Bild said.\n\nNot expecting it is what makes kindness so special. And yet, as unexpected as it is, we still crave kindness, which may very well be because research shows being kind is a natural part of the human condition.\n\n'We're genetically wired to be kind,' said David Hamilton, a former organic chemist from Scotland. 'It's actually our deepest identity.\n\nCBS News\n\n'It's when we're not being kind that it's unhealthy. It's when we're not being kind that we feel separate and we feel disconnected and we feel unhappy and something's 'out of sorts.''\n\nHamilton has made a career lecturing and writing about how kindness isn't just something we do, or something we feel. It's something our bodies actually need.\n\nHay House\n\n'Being kind, because it makes you feel warm and connected, it actually changes the internal biochemistry of your body,' he said. 'There's a physical effect, yeah. It's the opposite of stress.'\n\nThere is a hormone that is produced every time we do something kind. It's called oxytocin -- what he likes to call the 'kindness hormone.'\n\n'One of the things that it does, it softens the wall of the arteries,' Hamilton said. 'It's funny; it's like a mirror. As you become softer towards people, so you soften on the inside. It actually softens the walls of the arteries. And when that happens, the heart doesn't have to push as hard to get the blood through, so blood pressure drops.'\n\nAnd, he says, you can get that healthy effect by doing nothing more than offering a smile.\n\nCowan asked, 'So, it doesn't have to be some grand gesture, right?'\n\n'No, it's the consistency of doing small things that matter more than doing one grand gesture.'\n\nElizabeth Higgins Clark and her fiancée, Lauren Pomerantz, found that out when they set out to do one small act of kindness every day for an entire year.\n\nInstagram\n\nWhat was the reaction? 'A lot of our friends made fun of us,' said Pomerantz, laughing.\n\nHoping to inspire others, they posted their efforts on social media under the hashtag #KeepAmericaKind. They filled expired parking meters with coins; they sent pizzas to sheriff's departments; and baked cookies for strangers. They baked for construction workers, crossing guards, UPS drivers -- 'Anyone who we could think of who we thought would need a cookie,' said Clark.\n\nWhen they ran out of their own ideas, they'd seek out nonprofits, like Big Sunday, where they could go and volunteer. On the day Cowan visited, they were making care packages for the homeless.\n\nWhat Clark and Pomerantz found after 365 days of doing small acts like this is that kindness was like a muscle. If it went un-used, it would atrophy … and the urge to be kind would go away.\n\nCBS News\n\n'Once you keep going and keep going, and keep going, you build it up and it changes,' said Pomerantz.\n\n'It's like a work-out?' asked Cowan.\n\n'Yeah, it is. The more you do it, the more comfortable you are, the better you are at it,' Pomerantz said.\n\nWhich would seem to suggest the earlier you start being kind, the better.\n\nBrian Williams is the founder of Think Kindness, a program he developed specifically for schools to teach kids that no kind act is too small. 'My job is to figure out a way to go into a school and make kindness cool,' Williams said.\n\nCBS News\n\n'It's super important that we start kids early, to train them to say, look, every single day you have an opportunity to make a difference in the world, but it's up to you as to whether you'll take action.'\n\nAt Mount Rose Elementary in Reno, Nevada, Williams was recruiting what he calls Kindness Ninjas who do good deeds like writing a teacher 'You are awesome -- keep it up,' and then delivering that kind message without anyone ever noticing.\n\n'When we see those acts of kindness, it reinforces that belief, like, our world is good, our world is awesome, people are awesome, and we can all band together and make a difference,' said Williams.\n\nCBS News\n\nHe works with older students, too, like the ones at nearby B.D. Billinghurst Middle School, where messages of kindness and respect are everywhere you turn.\n\nThere's a whole 'kindness crew' who makes them. They also organize school-wide kindness campaigns that, students say, have changed their school's culture.\n\n'Kids have not been bullying people and they haven't been saying mean comments and stuff,' said Sam, a 'Kindness Crew' student.\n\n'It's not something that's you're just going to go into classrooms one month and then it's going to be like, oh, the whole school's kind; it's going to have to take convincing for those kids who don't want to do it,' said another 'kindness crew' member, Zoey.\n\nNobody needs to convince Traci Bild about the lasting power of kindness. Almost any Christmas tree reminds her of Jug (whose real name, by the way, was Gerald Woodruff). She still comes to visit him, even though he's long gone now.\n\nCBS News\n\nShe kept in touch with Jug's kids, too. Imagine all the Christmases that have come and gone, and yet here they were, decades later, talking about an act of kindness their dad had done that still resonates.\n\n'It amazes you, what one small act of kindness, how it grows,' said Jug's daughter. 'I mean, you never know. I mean, he never did stuff for a thank-you, he just saw a need, and he loved people, and just went right in and helped, yeah.'\n\nWhich gets us back to George Bailey. That Hollywood ending did prove one thing: Kindness begets kindness. It's contagious, in all the right ways.\n\nTraci Bild said, 'I think we think about doing kind things a lot, but then think, Ah, I'm not gonna, I don't need to do that, That's stupid, or Why would I do that? I think we just need to do it. Stop thinking about things and just do it!'\n\n\n\nFor more info:","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-healing-and-persistent-power-of-kindness/","None"
"Addiction and intrigue: Inside the Saudi palace coup\n(Reuters) - On Tuesday June 20 Mohammed bin Nayef, a powerful figure in Saudi Arabia’s security apparatus for the past two decades and the next in line to the throne, was summoned to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz on the fourth floor of the royal palace in Mecca.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef, the interior minister, arrives to a military parade in preparation for the annual Haj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca September 5, 2016. REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah/File Photo\n\nThere, according to a source close to MbN, as he is known, the king ordered him to step aside in favour of the king’s favourite son, Mohammed bin Salman. The reason: an addiction to painkilling drugs was clouding MbN’s judgment.\n\n“The king came to meet MbN and they were alone in the room. He told him: ‘I want you to step down, you didn’t listen to the advice to get treatment for your addiction which dangerously affects your decisions’,” said the source close to MbN.\n\nThe new details about the extraordinary meeting between the king and MbN that touched off the de facto palace coup help to explain the events that are reshaping the leadership of the world’s biggest oil exporting nation.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm MbN’s addiction issues.\n\nA senior Saudi official said the account was totally “unfounded and untrue in addition to being nonsense”.\n\n“The story depicted here is a complete fantasy worthy of Hollywood,” the official said in a statement to Reuters, which did not refer to MbN’s alleged use of drugs.\n\nThe official said MbN had been removed in the national interest and had not experienced any “pressure or disrespect”. Reasons for his dismissal were “confidential”.\n\nSources with knowledge of the situation said however that the king was determined to elevate his son to be heir to the throne and used MbN’s drug problem as a pretext to push him aside.\n\nThree royal insiders, four Arab officials with links to the ruling house of Saud, and diplomats in the region, told Reuters that MbN was surprised to be ordered to step aside.\n\n“It was a big shock to MbN,” said a Saudi political source close to MbN. “It was a coup. He wasn’t prepared.”\n\nThe sources said MbN did not expect to be usurped by the often impulsive Mohammed bin Salman, who MbN considered to have made a number of policy blunders, such as his handling of the Yemen conflict and cutting financial benefits to civil servants.\n\nThe high-stakes power grab has placed sweeping powers in the hands of the 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, and appears designed to speed his accession to the throne.\n\nShould he get the job, the young prince will preside over a kingdom facing tough times from depressed oil prices, the conflict in Yemen, rivalry with an emboldened Iran and a major diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.\n\nThe source close to MbN acknowledged that he had health issues, which were aggravated after an al Qaeda attacker tried to blow himself up in front of him in his palace in 2009. The health issues were corroborated by three other sources in Saudi Arabia and Arab official sources with links to the royal family.\n\nAn Arab source with close Saudi links also provided a similar account of the meeting at which King Salman asked MbN to step down because of his alleged drug addiction.\n\nRelated Coverage Saudi official dismisses palace coup report as Hollywood fantasy\n\nThese sources said MbN had shrapnel in his body that could not be removed and he depended on drugs such as morphine to alleviate the pain. One source said MbN had been treated in clinics in Switzerland on three occasions in recent years. Reuters was unable to confirm this independently.\n\nA PALACE COUP\n\nThe King moved ahead of a meeting of the Political and Security Council. The meeting was due to start at 11 pm, but a few hours before that, MbN received what he viewed as a routine phone call from Mohammed bin Salman. According to the source close to MbN, Mohammed bin Salman told MbN that the king wanted to see him.\n\nIn the hours that followed the meeting in which MbN was dismissed, the House of Saud’s Allegiance Council, comprising the ruling family’s senior members, were informed of a letter written in the name of the king.\n\nDrafted by palace advisers to MbS, it said MbN had a medical condition - drug addiction - and “we have been trying for over two years to persuade him to seek treatment but to no avail”.\n\n“Because of this dangerous situation we see that he should be relieved of his position and that Mohammed bin Salman be appointed in his place,” the Saudi source close to MbN quoted excerpts of the letter as saying.\n\nThe letter was read over the phone to members of the Allegiance Council, while MbN was kept isolated in a room all night, his mobile phone removed, and cut off from contact with his aides. His bodyguards from elite paramilitary interior ministry units were also replaced.\n\nEnvoys were sent to council members to get their signatures. All but three of 34 signed. The coup had worked.\n\nCalls by council members who backed MbN’s removal were recorded and played to him by a palace adviser to demonstrate the strength of the forces against him and to discourage any urge the 57-year-old crown prince might have to resist.\n\nAccording to two Saudi sources with links to the royal house, only three members of the council opposed his overthrow: Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, a former interior minister, Abdulaziz bin Abdallah, a representative of the family of late king Abdallah, and Prince Mohammad bin Saad, a former deputy governor of Riyadh. The three could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAt dawn MbN gave up. He told a palace adviser that he was ready to see the king. The meeting was short. MbN agreed to step down and signed a document to that effect.\n\nWhen MbN left the king’s quarters, he was surprised to see MbS waiting for him, the adviser said. MbN was embraced and kissed by MbS while television cameras rolled.\n\nSoon afterward a pre-written statement was released announcing the king’s decision to make his son the next crown prince. This was the clip that would play on all Saudi and Gulf media over the coming hours and days.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia confers with a member of his delegation during a high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants at the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 19, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nHOUSE ARREST\n\nMbN remains under house arrest to keep him out of circulation following his overthrow, with no visitors allowed except close family members. He is not taking calls, the source close to MbN said. In the past week he was only granted permission to visit his elderly mother with the new guards assigned to him.\n\nThe senior Saudi official said, however, that MbN had received guests, including the king and the new crown prince.\n\nThe source close to MbN said he would like to take his family to Switzerland or London but the king and MbS had decided that he must stay. “He wasn’t given any choice.”\n\nThe White House and CIA declined to comment. A senior administration official said Washington knew that MbS was the favourite of the king but “beyond that it’s very opaque”.\n\nThe elevation of MbS had been predicted by some Saudi and Western officials, but it came much sooner than expected with a rushed exit for MbN.\n\nSince King Salman’s accession, there had been clear indications that MbS was favoured over MbN, setting the stage for the younger prince to eclipse the formal heir to the throne.\n\nMbS was given unprecedented power by his ailing 81-year-old father, which he used to reorder the top jobs in the political, oil, security, security and intelligence sectors, often without the knowledge of MbN, according to diplomats and Saudi political and security sources.\n\nSince Salman took the helm just over two years ago, MbS has placed his men in key positions. MbS has been interfering in MbN’s interior ministry, appointing, promoting and firing officers without informing him.\n\nThe succession quarrel, the sources said, began in 2015 when MbN’s personal court was disbanded and merged with the court of the king, preventing MbN from bestowing independent patronage and cultivating support. This was followed by the sacking of Saad al-Jabri, MbN’s security adviser.\n\nWhen Donald Trump entered the White House, MbS cultivated contacts in Washington to offset the strong support that MbN had in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment because of his successes against al Qaeda.\n\nThe source close to MbN told Reuters the putsch went ahead after MbS struck up a strong relationship with Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\nA White House official declined comment when asked about Kushner’s relationship with MbS.\n\nThe official, referring to MbN’s removal as Crown Prince and MbS’ ascension to the post, said:\n\n“The United States government also sought not to intervene or to be seen as intervening in such a sensitive internal matter. We have great respect for the King, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and Prince Mohammed bin Salman and we consistently stressed our desire to maintain cooperation with the KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and its leadership. This message was communicated at all levels of government.”\n\nWith MbS’s sudden ascent, there is now speculation among diplomats and Saudi and Arab officials that King Salman is poised to abdicate in favour of his son.\n\nQuoting a witness at the palace, one Saudi source said King Salman this month pre-recorded a statement in which he announces the transfer of the throne to his son. The announcement could be broadcast at any time, perhaps as soon as September.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-palace-coup/addiction-and-intrigue-inside-the-saudi-palace-coup-idUSKBN1A41IS","1500507243.0"
"Minn. officer acquitted in shooting of Philando Castile during traffic stop, dismissed from police force\nThe Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop was acquitted on all charges by a jury on June 16, nearly a year after his death. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Minnesota police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop was acquitted on all charges by a jury Friday, a decision that came nearly a year after the encounter was partially streamed online to a rapt nation in the midst of a painful reckoning over shootings by law enforcement.\n\nOfficer Jeronimo Yanez pulled Castile’s car over in Falcon Heights, a suburb near Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the officer later said he thought Castile matched the description of a suspect in a robbery. The stop quickly escalated.\n\nYanez fired into the car, saying later he thought Castile was going for his gun, a claim Castile’s girlfriend, sitting in the seat next to him, disputed. She began streaming the aftermath of the shooting on Facebook Live.\n\nPolice officers are seldom charged for fatal on-duty shootings and convictions are even less common. Castile’s death came at a time of intense scrutiny of fatal police-involved shootings, and the viral video of his final moments spurred heated demonstrations that continued for weeks.\n\nOfficer Jeronimo Yanez. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP, File)\n\nOutside the court, where a small group of protesters gathered Friday afternoon, Castile’s relatives denounced the jury’s decision. Castile’s mother called his death a murder and tied the verdict to what she described as systemic racism in Minnesota.\n\n“The system continues to fail black people, and it will continue to fail you all,” Valerie Castile said, her anger building. “My son loved this city and this city killed my son. And the murderer gets away. Are you kidding me right now?”\n\nProsecutors charged Yanez with second-degree manslaughter in November, a felony, saying that “no reasonable officer” would have used deadly force in the same situation. He also was charged with two felony counts for intentionally discharging the gun. Jurors began deliberating Monday, and the verdict was announced Friday afternoon.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton (D) said the state continues to grieve with Castile’s family, calling his death “a terrible tragedy, with devastating consequences for everyone involved.”\n\nOn Friday evening, several hundred protesters amassed around the steps of the state Capitol in St. Paul to decry the verdict.\n\nProtesters marched in St. Paul and Minneapolis on June 16 after the acquittal of the Minn. officer who fatally shot Philando Castile. Activists ultimately shut down one of the main interstate highways in Minnesota. (The Washington Post)\n\nOne protester, local activist Vanessa Taylor, said the verdict confirmed her worst fears about the legal system.\n\n“Philando was everything that people say you’re supposed to be,” Taylor said. “He had a job, he was in a relationship, he helped take care of a child, he worked with kids — but none of that actually means anything or matters.”\n\nMany activists later moved to Interstate 94, one of the main highways in the Twin Cities area. A few dozen people briefly moved onto the road itself while facing police in riot gear, but most of the protesters soon dispersed.\n\n\n\nSupporters of Philando Castile march on Friday along an on-ramp for Interstate 94 in St. Paul, Minn. (Star Tribune via AP)\n\nPolice said about 500 protesters had gathered on the interstate late Friday, closing it to traffic. The Minnesota State Patrol said demonstrators would be arrested if they did not leave the interstate, and early Saturday, the agency said 18 protesters had been arrested.\n\nAmong the onlookers on the side of the highway was Melissa York, a St. Paul resident who was accompanied by her son and daughter. York compared Castile to Tamir Rice in Cleveland and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., both of whom were fatally shot by police officers.\n\n“My son here is soon to be 14, and he could very well be a victim like Tamir Rice or Mike Brown or all those other people,” York said as she watched protesters march down the highway. “It’s very important that he know what’s happening. I want him to be aware of what’s happening to our people in today’s society.”\n\nOfficials in St. Anthony, Minn., where Yanez worked as a police officer, said he will not return to the police department from leave after the trial. They said they have decided “the public will be best served if Officer Yanez is no longer a police officer in our city.”\n\n“The city intends to offer Officer Yanez a voluntary separation agreement to help him transition to another career other than being a St. Anthony officer,” the city said in a statement. “The terms of this agreement will be negotiated in the near future, so details are not available at this time. In the meantime, Officer Yanez will not return to active duty.”\n\nEarl Gray, an attorney for Yanez, praised the jury’s decision. “The verdict was a correct verdict,” he said, speaking to reporters after he left the courthouse. “In my opinion, the case should’ve never been charged.”\n\nFederal officials were assessing the verdict Friday, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota. That office had dispatched a career prosecutor to assist with the state’s case.\n\n“We determined that this course of action was the strongest available avenue for a prosecution, given the higher level of intent required under the applicable federal criminal civil rights law,” the office said in a statement. “In the wake of today’s verdict, we are assessing whether any additional federal review is justified.”\n\nDuring the trial, jurors heard testimony from dozens of witnesses, including Yanez, who cried on the stand while saying he did not want to shoot Castile. Yanez testified that he thought his life was in danger at the time, and attorneys for Yanez have argued that Castile caused his own death because of his actions during the traffic stop.\n\n[Thousands dead, few prosecuted: Officers are rarely charged]\n\nCastile was one of 963 people who police officers fatally shot last year, according to a Washington Post database tracking such shootings. The fatal encounter in Minnesota was among the most high-profile last year because Diamond Reynolds, Castile’s girlfriend, broadcast the moments after Castile’s shooting online, graphic footage that quickly circulated and drew international attention to the Twin Cities suburbs.\n\n[For Diamond Reynolds, trying to move past 10 tragic minutes of video]\n\nThe shooting, on July 6, 2016, became part of an ongoing debate about how law enforcement officers use deadly force, particularly toward black men and boys, and it occurred during a particularly frenzied period that also saw a controversial police shooting in Baton Rouge and an ambush that killed five police officers in Dallas.\n\nIn Minnesota, Reynolds calmly documented what happened after Yanez shot Castile, 32, a popular cafeteria worker at a local school. She explained into her phone that Castile was licensed to carry a firearm, and that he had told the officer that before reaching for his wallet.\n\nAccording to a complaint filed in Minnesota state court, police car audio and video recordings show that the gunfire erupted just a minute after Castile stopped his car.\n\n[Minnesota officer charged with manslaughter for shooting Philando Castile during incident streamed on Facebook]\n\nYanez approached the car window and asked Castile for his license and proof of insurance, which the driver handed over, the complaint states. Castile also told Yanez he had a firearm on him, and seconds later, the officer told the driver not to pull out the gun. Castile said he was not taking out the gun, which Reynolds echoed. Yanez screamed, “Don’t pull it out!” and pulled his own gun out, firing seven shots at Castile, the complaint states.\n\nThe complaint then shifts to quoting from Reynolds’s Facebook video, saying that the footage “begins immediately after the shooting and while Yanez had his gun drawn and pointed toward the mortally wounded Castile.” Reynolds says in the footage that Castile was trying to get his ID out before the officer opened fire.\n\n“Stay with me,” she said. She added: “They just killed my boyfriend.”\n\nWhen Yanez spoke to state investigators a day after the shooting, he told them he was “in fear for my life and my partner’s life.” Yanez told them that he thought Castile was reaching for the gun.\n\n“I thought I was gonna die,” he told investigators, according to the complaint.\n\n\n\nDiamond Reynolds, the girlfriend of Philando Castile, arriving in court last week. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nYanez and his partner, Officer Joseph Kauser, worked for the police force in St. Anthony, another city in the area. They were both considered model students before receiving their degrees in law enforcement in 2010. Both officers were put on leave after the shooting. Authorities did not charge Kauser, saying that he did not touch or remove his gun during the shooting.\n\nDuring the trial, Kauser defended Yanez, his former partner.\n\n“I think he followed protocol,” testified Kauser, who has since switched departments, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. “I trust him as a partner, and he did what he’s supposed to do in that situation.”\n\nProsecutors also charged Yanez with endangering the lives of Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter, who was also riding in the car. On Friday, Reynolds said she was “incredibly disappointed” with the verdict, saying that Castile cooperated and was stopped only because “he had a wide nose and looked like a suspect” to Yanez.\n\n“It is a sad state of affairs when this type of criminal conduct is condoned simply because Yanez is a policeman,” she said in a statement released by her attorneys. “God help America.”\n\nJason Sole, president of the Minneapolis NAACP, called the outcome “more of the same.”\n\n“How are you going to kill this guy and still say we have a fair system? How? Man, this behavior has gotta stop, and they can’t stop so they are going to continue to kill us,” Sole said outside the courthouse. “We haven’t progressed. … If you can kill me, with a baby in the back seat of a car, and get away with it, not guilty of any wrong doing? I can’t honor that system, and I won’t.”\n\nJohn J. Choi, the Ramsey County attorney who brought the charges last year, said he is disappointed with the outcome, but he called on people who protest to do so peacefully.\n\n“I can’t even imagine what this must feel like for the family of Philando Castile, his friends and all those that loved him,” Choi said. “And also for Diamond Reynolds. I’m just really sad for them.”\n\nWhen he announced the charges last year, Choi said that “no reasonable officer … would have used deadly force under these circumstances.”\n\nSpeaking on Friday after the verdict was announced, Choi said he believes Yanez is a good person who made a mistake. But he maintained that nothing Castile did justified his death.\n\n“The toughest part for me … is that he was so respectful in how he disclosed that he had that firearm,” Choi said. “He said sir, I have to tell you, I do have a firearm on me. He went beyond what the law requires. He was compliant. He wasn’t resisting.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, one of Yanez’s bullets went through the driver’s seat and hit the back seat. Reynolds’s daughter was sitting in a car seat on the other side of the car. Another bullet hit the armrest between Castile and Reynolds, the complaint stated.\n\n[Police group: Minn. governor ‘exploited what was already a horrible and tragic situation’]\n\nYanez pulled over Castile after seeing him driving and saying he looked like a suspect in a convenience store robbery that had occurred days earlier. Authorities later said Castile was not a suspect in that robbery.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the St. Paul Public Schools system said they continued “to remember and mourn the loss of ‘Mr. Phil,’ ” calling him a beloved employee.\n\nCastile was killed during an intense three-day eruption of violence last summer. A day earlier, an officer in Baton Rouge shot and killed Alton Sterling, another encounter captured on a video that quickly went viral. Castile’s death, like Sterling’s, set off protests across the country.\n\nAt one of these protests taking place a day after Castile was shot, a lone attacker in Dallas opened fire on police officers, killing five and wounding several others in the deadliest single day for law enforcement since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The attacker in Dallas told police he was angered by the shootings of Castile and Sterling, authorities said.\n\n[Minn. police officer who shot Philando Castile was model student, educator says]\n\nYanez was the first officer in Minnesota charged for an on-duty shooting since at least 2005, according to Philip M. Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who studies arrests of officers and has kept data since that year. The Star Tribune newspaper reported that Yanez is believed to be the first officer charged with killing a civilian in the state’s modern history.\n\nAfter the Castile verdict came out, Stinson said that of the 82 nonfederal law enforcement officers charged with murder or manslaughter for a fatal on-duty shooting, about a third — 29 officers — were convicted of a crime.\n\nMost of those 29 officers who were found guilty on any count were convicted of a lesser offense, he said. Five of the 29 officers found guilty on at least one count were convicted of murder. Including Yanez, 33 officers were not convicted; Yanez is the 17th officer acquitted after a jury trial. Another 20 criminal cases are still pending, Stinson said.\n\nEarlier this week, one of those cases — the trial of former Milwaukee police officer charged with homicide for a fatal shooting last year that set off violent unrest there — began unfolding in court.\n\nConvictions in such cases are even rarer than prosecutions. In Baltimore, six police officers were charged in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, but after three officers were found not guilty in separate trials, prosecutors last summer dropped charges against the remaining officers still facing trial.\n\nMistrials were declared last year in two other trials centered on high-profile police shootings that, like Castile’s death, followed traffic stops and included recordings that were widely shared.\n\nIn South Carolina, jurors deadlocked in the case of Michael Slager, a former police officer who fatally shot Walter Scott, a fleeing driver in North Charleston. State prosecutors had vowed to try him again, but Slager pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge this year, resolving both cases.\n\nJurors in Ohio also deadlocked during the first prosecution of Raymond Tensing, a former University of Cincinnati officer who shot Samuel DuBose during an off-campus stop. Prosecutors sought another trial, which began earlier this month.\n\nJared Goyette in St. Paul contributed to this story, which was first published June 16 and has been updated with new information.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings in 2017\n\nPhilando Castile was an adored school cafeteria manager\n\nThe NRA’s internal split over Philando Castile","https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/16/minn-officer-acquitted-of-manslaughter-for-shooting-philando-castile-during-traffic-stop/","1497585600.0"
"Presidential hopeful wants Finland out of EU, says nationalists will bounce back\nHELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland will leave the European Union and position itself as the Switzerland of the north to protect its independence if Laura Huhtasaari, the presidential candidate of the eurosceptic Finns Party has her way.\n\nFinns Party deputy chairman and presidential candidate Laura Huhtasaari poses for a picture at the Finland's Parliament in Helsinki, Finland December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Tuomas Forsell\n\nShe also told Reuters in an interview she wants to tighten immigration rules.\n\nHuhtasaari — dubbed “Finland’s Marine Le Pen” after France’s National Front leader — is a long-shot. But she believes she has a real chance in the January election as her party has taken a fresh start following its removal from the coalition government in June.\n\n“The rise in Europe of parties that are critical towards the EU and immigration is due to bad, unjust politics,” she said. “The role for Finland in the euro zone is the role of a loser and payer...\n\n“I do not want Finland to become a province of EU, Finns must stand up for Finland’s interests.”\n\nThe Finns Party, formerly called “True Finns”, rose from obscurity during the euro zone debt crisis with an anti-EU platform, complicating the bloc’s bailout talks with troubled states.\n\nIt expanded into the second-biggest parliamentary party in 2015 and joined the government, but then saw its support drop due to compromises in the three-party coalition.\n\nThis June, the party picked a new hard-line leadership and got kicked out of the government, while more than half of its lawmakers left the party and formed a new group to keep their government seats.\n\nHuhtasaari, 38, who was picked as deputy party leader in June, said voters were still confused after the split-up but that the party would eventually bounce back.\n\n“The game is really brutal. The biggest parties want us to disappear from the political map. No-one is in politics looking for friends.”\n\nThe Finns party ranks fifth in polls with a support of 9 percent, down from 17.7 percent in 2015 parliamentary election, while the new “Blue Reform” group, which has five ministers, is backed by only 1-2 percent.\n\nSTEP FORWARD, STEP BACK\n\nIncumbent President Sauli Niinisto, who originally represented the centre-right NCP party, is widely expected to be elected for a second six-year term by a wide margin.\n\nA poll by Alma Media last week showed 64 percent of voters supporting Niinisto while 12 percent backed lawmaker Pekka Haavisto from the Greens. Huhtasaari, a first term lawmaker, was backed by 3 percent of those polled.\n\n“Things happen slowly when you’re fighting against the hegemony... I still have time before the elections,” she said.\n\nHuhtasaari, who supports U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain’s former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, said the European eurosceptic movement was gradually strengthening despite a series of blows to anti-establishment parties.\n\nFrance’s National Front and Italy’s 5-Star Movement failed in attempts to win legislative and civic elections while UKIP won no seats in the British parliament, albeit that its goal of Brexit won a referendum.\n\n“Any change takes time, a step forward and step back... But the movement strengthens all the time,” she said, noting Austria’s Freedom Party’s strong performance in October elections.\n\nMarkku Jokisipila, the director at the Center for Parliamentary Studies of the University of Turku, said Huhtasaari was unlikely to succeed in the Jan 28 election.\n\nAround 70 percent of Finns support EU membership and the centre-right government is committed to the euro.\n\n“There’s no way around it, she is very inexperienced politically for this election,” Jokisipila said.\n\nHe added that the Finns party had become more united after the June split-up, but that it was now too focused on its anti-immigration and anti-EU platforms to be able to increase support.\n\n“They will not disappear from the Finnish politics. The challenge is to broaden their profile... but they have also proved that they do have surprise potential.”","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-eurosceptics/presidential-hopeful-wants-finland-out-of-eu-says-nationalists-will-bounce-back-idUSKBN1E722V","1513178463.0"

The officers — Lt. H. Jay Cullen and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates — died at the scene.\n\nThe details we know so far:\n\nWhat happened\n\nThe chaos kicked off when a group of white nationalists — including neo-Nazis, skinheads and Ku Klux Klan members — descended on Charlottesville for a Unite the Right rally. The gathering was spurred on by the city's plans to remove a Confederate statue from a local park. The white nationalists were met with hundreds of counterprotesters, and street brawls and violent clashes broke out. That prompted Gov. Terry McAuliffe to declare a state of emergency.\n\nProtesters gather at Justice Park in Charlottesville #cvilleaug12 pic.twitter.com/sprSzf0MTP — VA State Police (@VSPPIO) August 12, 2017\n\nAs the counterprotesters marched along a downtown street, a silver Dodge Challenger barreled through the crowd.

He also had a huge military history, especially with German military history and World War II. But he was pretty infatuated with that stuff,' Weimer told WCPO. He said that overall, Fields was a quiet, respectful student, albeit with radical views.\n\n'In his freshman year, he had an issue with that that was raised, and from then on, we knew that he had those issues.

"At least 26 dead in South Texas church shooting, officials say\nSUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Texas — A lone gunman stormed a small community church here on Sunday and fatally shot more than two dozen people before a local resident engaged him in a gun battle as the shooter exited the church. He fled at high speed with the civilian in pursuit before running off the roadway, where he was found dead, authorities said.\n\nWitnesses said a white man in his 20s dressed in all black and wearing a tactical vest started shooting with an assault rifle as he approached First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. Police said the gunman killed two people outside before entering the church and spraying bullets at the congregation during morning worship in the country town about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio. Dozens of people were hit with bullets, and the 26 dead ranged in age from 5 to 72, authorities said. One family reported the death of a year-old child. Most were shot in the pews as they worshiped.\n\nAfter the exchange of gunfire, the armed civilian jumped into the truck of a second resident who had stopped at the scene and the two took off after the shooter. It was “act now, ask questions later,” said the truck’s driver, Johnnie Langendorff. By the time they caught up with him, however, the fleeing man had crashed his SUV into a ditch. “He might have been unconscious from the crash or something like that, I’m not sure,” Langendorff told reporters.\n\n“The local citizen pursued him,” said Freeman Martin, a regional director for the Texas Department of Public Safety. “We don’t know if it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound or if he was shot by our local resident who engaged him in a gunfight.”\n\n[An unlikely hero describes gun battle and 95 mph chase with Texas shooting suspect]\n\nTwo law enforcement officials told The Washington Post that the shooter has been identified as Devin Kelley, 26, a Texas man who lived in a nearby county. Only fragments of Kelley’s background emerged in the hours after the shooting, among them that he was court-martialed in 2012 while serving in the U.S. Air Force and sentenced to a year in military prison for assaulting his spouse and child. He was reduced in rank and released with a bad-conduct discharge in 2014.\n\nNor had authorities speculated publicly about a possible motive as of early Monday morning with the investigation in its very early stages.\n\nPresident Trump, at a news conference Monday afternoon in Tokyo, said that he thought “mental health” was the problem. “Based on preliminary reports,” he said, the shooter was “a very deranged individual, a lot of problems for a long period of time.” Trump did not provide the basis for his statement, saying “it’s a little bit soon to go into it.”\n\n“ . . . This isn’t a guns situation,” he added. “Fortunately someone else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction” or it “would have been much worse.”\n\n[Who is Devin Patrick Kelley, the gunman officials say killed churchgoers in Sutherland Springs?]\n\nBut residents of this small, out-of-the-way town said they were rattled and dumbfounded at becoming yet another U.S. community victimized by a mass shooting.\n\nThe killings left massive and in some instances multigenerational gaps in some families. Joe and Claryce Holcombe lost children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all at once, a total of eight extended family members, the couple said in a phone interview with The Post.\n\nTheir son, Bryan Holcombe, 60, and his wife, Karla Holcombe, 58, were killed. Bryan was associate pastor for the church and walking to preach at the pulpit when he was shot, Joe Holcombe told The Post.\n\nAmong the dead was also their granddaughter-in-law, Crystal Holcombe, who was pregnant. She died along with her unborn child and three of her children, Emily, Megan and Greg, according to Joe Holcombe. She had been at church with her husband, John Holcombe, who survived along with two of her other children.\n\nTheir grandson, Marc Daniel Holcombe and his infant daughter, who is about a year old, also died, Joe and Claryce Holcombe said.\n\nNeighbors said they became aware of the shooting when they heard loud bangs — and even had bullets spray into their homes — shortly after 11 a.m. on Sunday. Local authorities said the first calls of an active shooter came in about 11:20 a.m., after the gunman opened fire with a Ruger assault-style rifle.\n\nKevin Jordan, 30, was changing the oil in his Ford Focus ahead of a family road trip when he heard the pops of gunfire. When he stood up and turned his head, he saw a man wearing body armor, a vest and a mask walk down the sidewalk toward the church about 50 yards from his home.\n\n“He was just spraying at the front of the church,” Jordan said. “He was shooting outside at first, and then he walked to the door and started shooting inside.”\n\nAuthorities said that at least 23 of the slain were killed inside the church. They said that two people were shot and killed outside and that one died at a hospital.\n\nAuthorities said they found multiple weapons in the gunman’s vehicle.\n\nAfter spotting the shooter, Jordan said, he ran inside his home, scooped up his son, alerted his wife and rushed his family into their bathroom, where they crouched and hid while calling 911. He said the shooter spotted him as he fled and took a shot that went through his front window, nearly hitting his 2-year-old son.\n\n“I looked at the shooter, and he looked right at me,” he said. When the shooting stopped, Jordan, who works as a medical assistant, ran to the church, hoping to help.\n\n“I walked inside and just walked out. I couldn’t handle it,” he said. “It was bad. A lot of blood and bodies. The pews were knocked over. I’m a medical assistant and medical assisting does not prepare you for this.”\n\nTucked a few hundred yards off Highway 87 amid scrubby farmland, the dusty and usually quiet streets of Sutherland Springs, lined with modest one-story family homes and trailers, were swarming with law enforcement Sunday evening. A town with few streetlights that typically goes dark after sundown flashed red and blue with police lights on almost every block.\n\nFederal authorities, including from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene. The Texas Ranger Division of the state’s DPS also is involved in the investigation.\n\nThe shooting Sunday came more than a month after a masked gunman stormed into a small community church outside of Nashville and shot seven people, including the pastor, killing one. Authorities said the suspect in that shooting, Emanuel Kidega Samson, might have been motivated by a desire for revenge for a 2015 shooting that targeted black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C. — an attack that left nine people dead.\n\n[Trump says Texas shooting is a problem of mental health, not guns]\n\nIt also came just more than a month after 58 people were killed at a Las Vegas country music festival, in what was the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history; the assailant, Stephen Paddock, killed himself after a lengthy shooting spree from his 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay hotel suite.\n\nFew details were immediately available about Kelley, and attempts to reach his family were unsuccessful Sunday. Kelley had at one point been in the military, enlisting in 2010 and serving as a logistical readiness airman stationed at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek, who also confirmed Kelley’s 2012 court-martial.\n\nIt was unclear Sunday how Kelley obtained the weapon he used or why he targeted the church. Neighbors said the gunshots they heard were thundering.\n\n1 of 56 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The scene after a shooting in a Texas church View Photos At least two dozen people are reported dead after a shooting at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., near San Antonio.

Minutes later, sirens burst onto her quiet street. She walked outside and saw multiple bodies on the ground outside the First Baptist Church, where she occasionally attends weeknight services.\n\nStanding outside her home down the street from the church, Segura stared at the throng of police cars and emergency vehicles, her head shaking in disbelief.\n\n“This is a small town and nothing never happens here,” she said. “We are family here, and that church is always filled with friends.”\n\nFrank Pomeroy, the pastor of First Baptist Church, told ABC News that he was not present during the church service but that his teenage daughter, Annabelle Pomeroy, 14, was among the dead.\n\n“She was very quiet, shy, always smiling, and helpful to all,” Cynthia Rangel, 50, a resident of nearby Stockdale, said of the teenager. Rangel, a local emergency medical technician, said she knew three individuals who were hospitalized after the shooting and were undergoing surgery. “This just all seems like it’s not real.”\n\nDana Fletcher, who owns a business a quarter-mile from the church, said she and her family just moved to Sutherland Springs. She said she was first alerted to the shooting by a call from a reporter.\n\n“My husband and I both are still in shock,” she said. “It’s a little tiny church that was targeted. It’s shocking. It’s a bit frightening because it’s a little bit close to home.”\n\nCarrie Matula, who works at a gas station near the church, told MSNBC she ran out to see what was happening after hearing gunshots.\n\n“I never thought it would happen here,” she said. “This is something that happens in a big city. I would have never thought this would have taken place here. It’s just too tight a community. It doesn’t make sense.”\n\nThe church is a part of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the country, with about 15 million members. First Baptist reported an average estimated attendance of 100 in 2015. The church is affiliated with the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention, considered one of Texas’s more theologically conservative groups of Southern Baptists.\n\nKathy Forton, 65, who has lived much of her life in the rural area of Wilson County, said the town has suffered an economic downturn since the county seat was moved to Floresville after a fire many years ago.\n\n“The church helped out in so many ways, “ Forton said. “Just the most precious, loving people. The people from the church used their own money to provide turkeys for the community at Thanksgiving and presents for kids at Christmas. The loss of these people is going to devastate that community.”\n\nTrump first addressed the shooting while traveling in Asia early Monday, sending his thoughts and prayers to the victims and families.\n\n“This act of evil occurred as the victims and their families were in their place of sacred worship,” he said. “We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they so dearly loved. Our hearts are broken, but in dark times — and these are dark times — such as these, Americans do what they do best: We pull together. We join hands. We lock arms, and through the tears and through the sadness we stand strong — oh, so strong.”\n\nThe church is a part of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the country, with about 15 million members.

"Hackers halt plant operations in watershed cyber attack\n(Reuters) - Hackers likely working for a nation-state recently invaded the safety system of a critical infrastructure facility in a watershed attack that halted plant operations, according to cyber investigators and the firm whose software was targeted.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The FireEye logo is seen outside the company's offices in Milpitas, California, U.S. December 29, 2014. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/File Photo\n\nFireEye Inc (FEYE.O) disclosed the incident on Thursday, saying it targeted Triconex industrial safety technology from Schneider Electric SE (SCHN.PA).\n\nSchneider confirmed that the incident had occurred and that it had issued a security alert to users of Triconex, which cyber experts said is widely used in the energy industry, including at nuclear facilities, and oil and gas plants.\n\nFireEye and Schneider declined to identify the victim, industry or location of the attack. Cyber-security company Dragos said the hackers targeted an organization in the Middle East, while a second firm, CyberX, said it believe the victim was in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt marks the first report of a safety system breach at an industrial plant by hackers, who have in recent years placed increasing attention on breaking into utilities, factories and other types of critical infrastructure, cyber experts said.\n\nCompromising a safety system could let hackers shut them down in advance of attacking other parts of an industrial plant, potentially preventing operators from identifying and halting destructive attacks, they said.\n\nSafety systems “could be fooled to indicate that everything is okay,” even as hackers damage a plant, said Galina Antova, co-founder of cyber-security firm Claroty.\n\n“This is a watershed,” said Sergio Caltagirone, head of threat intelligence with Dragos. “Others will eventually catch up and try to copy this kind of attack.”\n\nIn the incident, hackers used sophisticated malware to take remote control of a workstation running a Schneider Electric Triconex safety shutdown system, then sought to reprogram controllers used to identify safety issues. Some controllers entered a fail safe mode, which caused related processes to shut down and caused the plant to identify the attack, FireEye said.\n\nFireEye believes the attacker’s actions inadvertently caused the shutdown while probing the system to learn how it worked, said Dan Scali, who led FireEye’s investigation.\n\nThe attackers were likely conducting reconnaissance to learn how they could modify safety systems so they would not operate in the event that the hackers intended to launch an attack that disrupted or damaged the plant, he said.\n\nPUBLIC WARNINGS\n\nThe U.S. government and private cyber-security firms have issued public warnings over the past few years about attempts by hackers from nations including Iran, North Korea and Russia and others to attack companies that run critical infrastructure plants in what they say are primarily reconnaissance operations.\n\nCyberX Vice President Phil Neray said his firm found evidence that the malware was deployed in Saudi Arabia, which could suggest that Iran may be behind the attack.\n\nSecurity researchers widely believe that Iran was responsible for a series of attacks on Saudi Arabian networks in 2012 and 2017 using a virus known as Shamoon.\n\nSchneider provided Reuters with a customer security alert, dated Wednesday, which said it was working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to investigate the attack.\n\n“While evidence suggests this was an isolated incident and not due to a vulnerability in the Triconex system or its program code, we continue to investigate whether there are additional attack vectors,” the alert said.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesman Scott McConnell said the agency was looking into the matter “to assess the potential impact on critical infrastructure.”\n\nThe malware, which FireEye has dubbed Triton, is only the third type of computer virus discovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes.\n\nThe first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nThe second, known as Crash Override or Industroyer, was discovered last year by researchers who said it was likely used in a December 2016 attack that cut power in Ukraine.","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-infrastructure-attack/hackers-halt-plant-operations-in-watershed-cyber-attack-idUSKBN1E8271","1513275331.0"
